1. Quality 
Our network mirrors the quality of service  
that terrestrial communications offer. We have 
market-beating Service Level Agreements and 
no in-country coverage gaps. 
 
2. Flexibility 
Avanti has a unique Cloud-based customer 
interface that provides a single point of co-
ordination and control, allowing partners to 
become virtual network operators without the 
need to deploy their own capital or expertise. 
 
3. Innovation 
We’ve developed proprietary and patented 
technology which is deployed throughout  
our network. 
 
 
4. Very high throughput 
The HYLAS fleet uses Ka-band which enables 
our High Throughput Satellites (‘HTS’) to 
transmit over 10 times more data per satellite 
than legacy systems. 
 
5. High speed 
Our network can provide download speeds  
of up to 380Mbps, no matter how challenging 
the location. 
 
 
6. Affordability 
Ka-band HTS services are far cheaper than 
traditional and HTS Ku-band systems.

In the first half of the financial year, Avanti’s financial 
position suffered disruption when the additional debt 
facilities sought were not forthcoming on suitable 
terms. After a period of very hard work, our existing 
bondholders and long term investors supported the 
Company through a refinancing transaction that 
provided $242million of additional liquidity through a 
mixture of new money and interest deferrals.  
The disruption of the first six months of the year led to a lengthening 
of the sales cycle as our customers and potential customers waited 
for the refinancing and strategic review to be completed. Following 
the completion of the transaction, some confidence did return to the 
customer base, but the lag in the sales cycle has taken some time 
to reverse, meaning that our revenues for the year were significantly 
lower than initially expected. 
Nevertheless, Avanti did win some significant business towards the 
end of the year. The award of a new 3 year contract worth up to $21 
million to deploy several hundred services to government sites 
across Africa with an existing government customer strengthens our 
business with governments across our target markets. Furthermore, 
the SaT5G (Satellite and Terrestrial network for 5G) project has 
started well. This project will research, develop and validate key 
technologies required to enable the plug-and-play integration of 
satellite communications into 5G networks. The project will trial and 
assess these through live testbed demonstrations across Europe 
Shortly after the year end David Williams, Chief Executive and co-
founder, left the business. Alan Harper, who at the time was a non-
executive director of the Company, agreed to take up the role of 
interim Chief Executive. Alan has 25 years of experience in 
European and African telecoms markets. He has worked at 
Vodafone as Group Strategy Director and more recently founded 
and ran Eaton Towers, which served most of the major telco that are 
a key part of the strategy for expansion at Avanti. Alan is focussed 
on rebuilding the sales momentum of the business and ensuring 
that the Group has a go to market strategy that is fit for the current 
market. The search for a full time replacement is underway and we 
hope to make an announcement shortly.  
As recently announced, the Board has launched a restructuring of 
the Company’s balance sheet. The restructuring is aimed at 
correcting the capital structure that has developed given recent 
trading and will provide the platform for success over the medium-
term.  It is proposed to issue new shares to repay all of the 2023 
notes which would reduce the Group’s debt by in excess of $500m. 
This is subject to the agreement of the shareholders at a General 
Meeting to be held in early 2018. In addition, the Board has agreed 
with our Bondholders, subject to necessary consents, to reduce the 
interest rate on the 2021 notes to 9% with the ability to pay cash or 
roll up the interest as appropriate.  The combined impact of these 
two developments will reduce the Group’s annual interest charge 
by approximately 70%. I hope that you see fit to support this 
initiative which will give Avanti a significantly strengthened balance 
sheet and remove a significant impediment to sales growth.  
I would also like to thank our employees, customers, suppliers and 
investors for their ongoing support.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW

Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
Our satellites provide high performance, affordable 
connectivity to governments, businesses and 
individuals across EMEA either directly through 
satellite dishes installed at the user location, or by 
providing backhaul connectivity to mobile networks. 
Trading 
Trading in the first half of the year was slower than hoped for 
primarily as a result of the uncertainty associated with the strategic 
review which the Company initiated in July 2016. 
This uncertainty manifested itself in lower than normal levels of 
pipeline conversion and an extension in the sales cycle. Of the high 
probability pipeline that existed at 30 June 2016, 30% was signed 
by 31 December 2016 compared to historic conversion rates of 
over 60%. Since the conclusion of the strategic review and the 
successful provision of additional financing, we won some 
significant new business and believe that the pipeline conversion 
rate should now accelerate. 
In late December 2016 we received significant new tender awards 
and signed contracts in the wi-fi and cellular backhaul markets and 
in government networks.  We also picked up new customers for 
broadband in Europe, spurred by our launch of new 40Mb 
platforms – the highest speed satellite broadband in Europe.  
In the second half of the year we saw some confidence return to our 
customer base and secured some excellent contract wins across all 
four markets of Broadband, Government, Enterprise and Backhaul. 
A few notable examples are: 
Satellite and Terrestrial Network for 5G (SaT5G). This project will 
research, develop and validate key technologies required to enable 
the plug-and-play integration of satellite communications into 5G 
networks. The project will trial and assess these through live 
testbed demonstrations across Europe. The goal of the project is to 
deliver the seamless, and economically viable, integration of 
satellite into 5G networks to ensure ubiquitous 5G access 
everywhere. The project has identified a range of primary research 
areas to address the integration of satellite into 5G networks, which 
include extending 5G security to satellite and multicast for content 
distribution. Each research area will deliver outputs and benefits in 
relation to 5G ecosystem stakeholders. Live demonstrations and 
validations will take place at the testbeds for the project which are 
located in the UK, Germany and Finland. The project will also drive 
standardisation, mainly in 3GPP and ETSI, contributing to the 
definition of the 5G system and integration of satellite 
communications. 
The ERDF contract, which was signed in August 2016, will support 
the deployment of 40Mbps broadband services to rural businesses 
across Cornwall and Isles of Scilly. Services are available through 
Avanti’s certified service providers, Bentley Walker and SSW. The 
service will provide the highest satellite broadband speeds 
available in Europe via Avanti’s Ka-band HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2 
satellites to Cornish businesses, no matter how rural the location.  
In March, the Company announced a partnership with leading 
international telecommunications company Millicom, to bring 
broadband connectivity to consumer, enterprise and government 
applications. This will include the deployment of the Avanti ECO 
initiative across Sub-Saharan Africa, which will provide ECO Wi-Fi 
services to schools and communities, addressing the digital divide 
in the region. By combining Avanti’s world leading satellite 
technology with the market reach expertise from Millicom, the 
partnership will additionally commission a new Gateway Earth 
Station (GES) in Senegal. 
Pricing 
As we reported at the end of the last financial year in order to win 
volume in certain markets where end-customers are highly price 
sensitive, such as broadband in Europe, we have adjusted our 
prices. Our products are sold as Mb or managed accounts or as 
fully integrated projects but we calculate the Price, or Yield, per 
MHz per month. Global pricing for satellite capacity is falling in 
many markets, although each region is different. 
Our average price per MHz in the last 12 months across the fleet 
was $1,400.

Satellite assets 
You will note from the financial statements that we have impaired 
the carrying value of HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2.  
HYLAS 1 is 7 years old now and its cost per MHz is high in 
comparison to the new generation of High Throughput Satellites. 
The finite life of the satellite combined with falling capacity prices  
resulted in  an accounting impairment of $53.3m. HYLAS 1 remains 
an integral part of the Avanti fleet, is forecast to generate good 
EBITDA and cash flows, and continues to serve some important 
customers in Western Europe. 
In addition we have impaired HYLAS 2 by $60.8m, once again 
reflecting falling capacity prices and the finite life of the satellite. 
This impairment effectively eliminates previously capitalised 
financing costs leaving the carrying value close to the Net Book 
Value of the procured asset cost. HYLAS 2 is expected to generate 
strong EBITDA and cash flows as revenues grow over the largely 
fixed operating costs of the business. 
The 3GHz ‘HYLAS 2-B’ satellite payload that joined the fleet in 2015 
came online in the period with coverage over France, Germany, 
Poland and the Baltic Sea. The addition of this new capacity, which 
increases available capacity from 14GHz to 17GHz means the 
utilisation metric has been re-based. The amended fleet utilisation is 
in the 30-35% band (June 2016 re-based: 25-30% band).  
The tactical 4 GHz HYLAS 3 is a hosted payload flying on board a 
European Space Agency (‘ESA’) satellite, for which the ESA is 
presently declaring a late-2018 launch which could slip further. We 
are disappointed in the performance of the manufacturer of this 
system and are considering all options.  
The construction of Avanti’s key 28GHz HYLAS 4 satellite is at an 
advanced stage but has experienced some delays in the factory. 
The spacecraft is now expected to be delivered in January 2018 
with a launch in March 2018.  HYLAS 4 will complete Avanti’s 
coverage of EMEA. This will materially enhance the Group’s 
revenue generation potential, largely within the existing fixed cost 
base. The efficient procurement of HYLAS 4 will bring the overall 
fleet cost per MHz down significantly, mitigating some of the effects 
of falling global prices for satellite bandwidth. 
In November 2017, we successfully re-orbited Artemis. 
Working Capital 
The Company had to make a significant provision against a 
government receivable at the end of the year. Avanti had 
contracted with the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to lease 
capacity on its Artemis satellite to support GoI’s need to bring into 
use and maintain its orbital slot at 123 degrees East. The total 
contract value was in excess of $30 million. Avanti performed all of 
its obligations under the contract and had extended payment 
deadlines for GoI to assist with administrative delays. However, 
having received in excess of $12m in the earlier stages of the 
contract, Avanti received no payments for over a year. As a result, 
Avanti terminated the contract and has initiated arbitration 
proceedings in London. The outstanding amount at 30 June was 
$16.8 million and has been fully provided in these accounts. GoI 
has not disputed that the amounts are due and payable. Avanti is 
confident that the arbitration panel will rule in the Group’s favour 
and has provided for the debt at the year end until the uncertainty 
related to the arbitration and particularly enforcing the Group’s 
expectation of the arbitration panel’s ruling has been sufficiently 
reduced.  
Outlook 
HYLAS 4 is due for launch in March 2018 with a target of being in 
orbital position ready for service at the start of the next financial 
year. We are in discussion with a number of current and new 
distributors to sign up master partnership distribution agreements 
with Avanti to market this new capacity which is largely over sub 
Saharan Africa countries.

MARKET OVERVIEW

Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
Satellites provide data communications and 
broadcasting services around the world. Satellites 
are used versus terrestrial infrastructure in situations 
where they can provide superior economics to 
customers or where other forms of communication 
are not available.  
Avanti operates in the fixed data communications part of the 
satellite market. Avanti has pioneered the use of Ka-band 
technology, which enables us to service this market at a lower 
cost than legacy operators.  
In turn, this vastly increases the addressable market for satellite 
data communications, particularly in the high growth geographies 
where Avanti’s capacity is focused, but also closer to home where 
Avanti can offer universal superfast broadband across Europe.  
In these areas, dispersed populations and huge land areas make 
terrestrial communications uneconomic to deploy. For example, 
Africa has the same land mass as Europe, USA, China and India 
combined, yet a population the same as just India alone.  
As a result of this low population density, fibre will not be deployed 
in European equivalent scale in the local loop during the lifetime of 
our satellites and so Africa is moving directly to wireless. In wireless 
technology, Ka-band HTS satellite is the best way to deliver high 
capacity, low cost, data services.  
We estimate that the addressable market for our HTS services 
across the EMEA region, defined as users who both need satellite 
connectivity and have the ability to pay for it, is over 1,000 Gbps. 
Avanti’s HYLAS satellite fleet will provide up to 200 Gbps of data 
throughput. According to Cisco, Africa and Middle East is the 
fastest growing mobile data market in the World increasing 12-fold 
over the 5 years to 2021, and therefore Avanti is well placed to 
serve this growth. 
 
 
 
 
 
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
 
 
The Top-20 Customer Bandwidth Revenue Growth metric helps to 
track Avanti’s growth trajectory from core service sales. It is 
calculated by comparing the revenues from current leading 
customers on a last 12 month and constant currency basis, to the 
12 months preceding that. Revenues from this customer group 
were 15% lower in the 2017 financial year ($24.6m) versus 2016 
($28.4m).  The decrease is as a result of the effect of the strategic 
review on new business, falling capacity prices and the impact of 
the termination of a small number of partners with a poor payment 
record. 
The Fleet Utilisation metric helps to track capacity uptake and gives 
an indication of revenue potential when Avanti’s fleet is mature. It is 
calculated by expressing utilised capacity as a percentage of total 
available capacity for the fleet of HYLAS 1 (3 GHz), HYLAS 2 (11 
GHz), HYLAS 2B (3GHz) and ARTEMIS (1 GHz).. The addition of 
HYLAS-2B in the current year increases available capacity from 
15GHz to 18 GHz and as a result the utilisation metric has been re-
based. The amended fleet utilisation is in the 30-35% band (June 
2016 re-based: 25-30% band).

OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY 
 
 
 
Avanti Communications Group plc

Our business model  
Avanti generates revenue from the commercial exploitation of its 
space and network assets. These assets include its spectrum 
rights, satellites, intellectual property and ground station assets.  
Avanti charges its service provider customers for the use of its 
network and other assets in a number of ways: broadband 
packages, managed capacity, fully integrated project fees, raw 
capacity, pure spectrum and a number of other product categories 
and charging models to suit customer and market circumstances.  
Avanti connects people wherever they are – in their homes, 
businesses, in government and on mobiles. Through the HYLAS 
satellite fleet serving service providers in 118 countries, the network 
provides ubiquitous internet service to a quarter of the world’s 
population. Avanti delivers the level of quality and flexibility that the 
most demanding telecoms customers seek.  
Avanti’s technology platform is made up of two operational satellites 
and one hosted payload in orbit, two satellites under construction, 
and a ground segment infrastructure delivering comprehensive 
coverage of Europe, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa.  
These assets, along with the associated spectrum rights, are turned 
into a virtual network service accessible by our service provider 
customers. This is done using the Avanti Cloud, a software based 
control system that allows all parts of the Avanti network to be 
controlled and configured online.  
Avanti has developed proprietary and patented technology which is 
deployed throughout its network. This technology has been 
developed in house by its employees, who are amongst the most 
experienced in the industry.  
Avanti uses the high frequency Ka-band spectrum. This enables 
our High Throughput Satellites to transmit over 10 times more data 
per satellite than legacy systems, significantly reducing end-user 
costs and creating a larger addressable market.  
A combination of the efficiencies that are inherent in the use of Ka-
band and Avanti’s high-powered network design also make our 
systems significantly more efficient than the emerging Ku-band high 
throughput networks.  
Our network can provide download speeds of up to 380Mbps and 
we can offer customers price reductions versus legacy Ku-band 
systems of up to 80%. 
Avanti’s business model is differentiated from those of legacy 
satellite operators primarily by its use of Ka-band technology and 
the Avanti Cloud. The Avanti Cloud enables the sale of satellite 
capacity as a service, rather than as an infrastructure purchase.  
Like other infrastructure companies, Avanti’s business model 
involves significant upfront capital expenditure to launch services 
and a largely fixed operating cost base. This is expected to result in 
initial cash outflows being followed by strong cash inflows as the 
business grows.   
The satellite industry has very high barriers to entry. These include 
the intellectual capital that is needed to design and run a satellite 
network and the requirement for orbital slots and spectrum. Avanti 
believes that terrestrial wireless services are rapidly consuming all 
of the available spectrum globally and recent industry debates 
show that there is great pressure on spectrum. Thus Avanti’s estate 
of spectrum rights should provide secure long term value to the 
business.  
Avanti seeks to lease and sell spectrum rights to third parties where 
opportunities arise and to commercially exploit its satellite and 
ground station assets outside of the operation of its own satellites, 
for example through satellite interim missions, consultancy projects, 
engineering services, satellite control services and ground station 
operation services. 
The risks to Avanti’s business model through technological change 
are low, primarily due to the very long lead times needed to develop 
and launch new satellite technologies. 
Our strategy  
The Group has performed a review of its go to market strategy post 
year end. Avanti is well positioned in the attractive High Throughput 
Services market with a strategy to pursue a focussed B2B channel 
push strategy to become the satellite wholesale partner of choice to 
its target customers. 
Avanti’s strategy is founded on the assumptions that data usage will 
continue to grow strongly for the foreseeable future; that terrestrial 
infrastructure will not satisfy demand; and that high growth markets 
offer the highest returns.  
Avanti’s end user application segments, which remain unchanged, 
are:  
 Commercial Mobility 
 Enterprise Data – including cellular backhaul 
 Government & Military 
 Broadband Access 
Avanti’s focus is on developing deep relationships with a small 
number of large key channel partners in the following three 
distribution channels: 
 Satellite Operators 
 Major Mobile / Telecom Carriers 
 Major Satellite Resellers, Integrators and ISPs 
  STRATEGIC REPORT 
FINANCIAL REVIEW

Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
Outlook 
During the last 18 months, Avanti has taken steps to address the 
appropriateness of its balance sheet given the current levels of 
trading experienced in the recent periods and the capital 
commitments required to launch HYLAS 4. 
As reported last year, Avanti entered a period of strategic review in 
July 2016. As a result the majority of the interest due on 1 October 
2016 was rolled into the principal of the outstanding loan notes.  
In January 2017, the Company announced that it had reached 
agreement with its major bondholders to provide additional 
financing of up to $242 million through new money and the ability to 
payment-in-kind (‘PIK’) coupons on both the 2021 and the 2023 
notes. We were also pleased at that point to welcome onto the 
Board Craig Chobor, Michael Leitner and Peter Reed as 
representatives of key stakeholders. 
This new facility also paved the way to add a super senior facility at 
the top of the security structure. In July 2017 HPS provided an 
additional $100 million of financing at an annual rate of 7.5% with a 
maturity of June 2020. After the drawdown of the HPS funds in July 
2017 the gross debt of the Company was $926.5 million, as set out 
in the table below:
 
 
Maturity Interest Rate Face Value Book Value 
 
 Cash (%)  PIK (%) $ millions $ millions 
Super Senior June 2020 7.5 n/a 100.0 95.8

Finance lease Various various n/a 13.5 13.5 
TOTAL    926.5 689.5 
 
In December 2017, the Board announced that subject to the 
agreement of the bondholders and of the shareholders at a General 
Meeting in early 2018, the entirety of the 2023 notes will be repaid 
by issuing new ordinary shares in Avanti Communications Group 
plc (“debt for equity swap”). In addition, subject to agreement from 
the 2021 bondholders, the maturity of these notes will be extended 
by 12 months to October 2022 and the interest rate reduced to 9% 
for both cash and PIK. 
Income Statement 
As previously mentioned on page 3 the strategic review caused 
some disruption to the business in the six months to December 
2016 which included a significant lengthening of the sales cycle. 
This has taken some months to reverse and has had a direct impact 
on the revenue recognised in the year to June 2017. As a 
consequence, we have reported revenue of $56.6 million down from 
$82.8 million in 2016. 
As a result of the significant provision made against the 
Government of Indonesia debt, total operating costs rose from 
$75.5 million in 2016 to $89.1 million. Excluding this provision of 
$13.9 million, costs fell by 0.4%. 
Staff costs fell slightly to $23.6 million (2016: $24.3 million) of which 
$3.9 million (2016: $4.5 million) was capitalised as costs relating to 
staff working on the construction of HYLAS 3 and HYLAS 4. See 
note 7 on page 54. 
We have taken impairment charges through the income statement 
as described in the balance sheet section below and more fully 
described in notes 13 and 14 on pages 58 and 61. 
 
As a result of the financial restructuring in January 2017, there was 
a substantial modification to the 2023 notes. Therefore we have 
recorded the liability on the balance sheet at the market value 
immediately after the restructuring had been completed. The 
carrying value of the 2023 notes was reduced from $481.6 million to 
$245.6 million with the difference being credited to the income 
statement (note 9), along with accelerated amortisation of 
previously capitalised bond costs of $16.8m. 
Tax 
There was a tax credit of $12.0m to the income statement (2016: 
$2.2m charge). The credit primarily arose from the recognition of  
deferred tax on losses (credit $15.6m) offset by the impact of 
changes in the UK tax rate on the deferred tax balances largely 
driven by future HYLAS 4 profits (charge $3.3m). 
Corporate Interest Restrictions 
With effect from April 1st 2017, the tax deductibility of interest costs 
will broadly be restricted to 30% of ‘UK Tax EBITDA’ (a new 
measure based on taxable profit). Disallowed interest is carried 
forward indefinitely, but will only become deductible if interest costs 
fall below 30% of UK Tax EBITDA in a future period.  
Group forecasts currently assume the Group will not increase its 
debt from the current (post debt for equity swap) level. This results 
in the disallowed interest arising in the next few years becoming 
deductible in the future, supporting the recognition of a deferred tax 
asset on that disallowed interest ($0.4m at 30 June 2017). 
However, if the Group increases its indebtedness (e.g. to finance 
future missions) interest costs may never fall beneath 30% of UK 
Tax EBITDA. As a result the disallowed interest costs would 
become permanently lost.   STRATEGIC REPORT

Changes to Loss Utilisation Rules 
With effect from 1 April 2017, restrictions have been introduced in 
the UK on the use of brought forward losses, which broadly limit the 
use of brought forward losses to 50% for taxable profits above £5m. 
This will result in a slower utilisation of those losses. 
Loss for the year 
The loss for the year was $65.7 million (2016: $69.2 million) 
resulting in a basic loss per share of 44.7 cents (2016: loss 49.3 
cents).  
Balance Sheet 
Impairments  
Each year the Group considers the carrying value of its assets and 
looks for indications of impairment. Falling market prices for satellite 
services have reduced the ability of future cash generation to make-
up for the slower than expected revenue generation in the earlier 
years of HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2. With the satellites having a finite 
life the Group has concluded that it would be appropriate to impair 
the carrying value of HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2. With a construction 
cost of $190.3 million and a carrying value of $117.2 million, HYLAS 
1 has a historic cost of $541 per MHz per month. With a 
construction cost of $389.8 million and a carrying value of $287.6 
million, HYLAS 2 has a historic cost of $381 per MHz per month. 
Using current selling prices and anticipated fill rates together with a 
discount rate of 10.4% the Company has concluded that more 
appropriate carrying values are $58.1 million and $234.8 million 
respectively. As a result an impairment charge of $114.1 million was 
made at the year end. 
In addition, Filiago has not achieved the targets set in the recent 
past. The Group has decided to make significant changes to the 
way that business is managed. However, until those changes 
deliver the required targets the Group has decided to impair the 
carrying value by $9.9 million. 
Artemis 
The Artemis satellite was re-orbited from its position at 123E in 
November 2017. This ends the life of the former ESA spacecraft that 
was launched in July 2001.

Receivables at 30 June were $60.6 million (2016: $79.5 million).  
After the year end, in November 2017, the Group reluctantly 
terminated a contract with the MOD of Indonesia for persistent non-
payment  and has initiated arbitration proceedings in London. 
Given the materiality of the outstanding amounts at the year-end 
($16.8 million) the Directors deemed it appropriate to make a full 
provision for the outstanding amounts in these accounts. Revenue 
was recognised on this contract during the year on the basis that 
regular dialogue with the Government of Indonesia was undertaken, 
formal commitments to pay were received and the debt remains 
undisputed. Avanti is confident that the arbitration panel will rule in 
the Group’s favour and has provided for the debt at the year end 
until the uncertainty related to enforcing the arbitration panel’s 
expected ruling has been sufficiently reduced.  
During the year we terminated a contract with Qsat in Ireland for 
consistent non-payment. Avanti had the right in its contract to“step-
in” and moved the majority of customers to one of our UK based 
service providers. As a result we made provisions of $0.7 million 
and $2.5 million against receivables and accrued income 
respectively associated with the Qsat contracts.  
High yield debt 
As described above, the 2023 notes were amended in a consent 
solicitation process during December 2016 and January 2017. 
Under the relevant accounting standards, the modification of the 
terms were deemed to be substantial. As a result the original bonds 
are required to be de-recognised and the new bonds recorded at 
market value at that date. In the period after the modification was 
ratified through the consent solicitation process, the bonds traded 
down to 51 cents /$1. The consequence was that the carrying value 
of this tranche of debt was reduced to $245.6 million with the 
resulting credit of $219.2 million recognised in the income 
statement as an Exceptional gain on substantial modification of 
debt. The carrying value of the debt will accrete up to the face 
value over the maturity of the bonds, giving rise to a higher finance 
expense than would otherwise be recorded. 
Cash flow  
Net cash outflow from operating activities during the year ended 
June 30, 2017 was $4.1 million as compared to an outflow of $31.8 
million during the year ended June 30, 2016.   
Interest paid was $3.5 million (2016: $60.5 million), the significant 
decrease being due to the coupon payments due on debt being 
settled through the issue of additional notes rather than the 
payment of cash.  
Capital expenditure fell from $95.7 million in 2016 to $66.5 million in 
2017. 
Additional financing net of restructuring costs brought in $51.9 
million compared to $123.6 million raised in 2016. 
Exchange losses accounted for net cash outflow of $1.5 million 
leaving cash at the year-end of $32.7 million (2016: $56.4 million). 
Insurance  
Avanti maintains a full suite of insurance policies covering not only 
space assets, but also business interruption associated with the 
failure of its ground earth stations. The HYLAS 1 and 2 in orbit 
insurance policies were renewed in November 2017 with an insured 
value of £112m and $306m respectively.  STRATEGIC REPORT

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
Backlog  
Our backlog comprises our customers’ committed contractual 
expenditure under existing contracts for the sale of bandwidth, 
satellite services, consultancy services and equipment sales over 
their current terms. Backlog does not include the value arising from 
potential renewal beyond a contract’s current term or projected 
revenue from framework contracts. Our backlog totalled $103.9m 
as of June 30, 2017. 
Due to political and economic difficulties in some of the regions we 
operate, a number of the contracts signed with partners in the early 
years of operations are proving to be impaired. We have chosen to 
remove these from backlog whilst at the same time working with 
those partners to find more appropriate terms on which to continue 
to work. In addition the definition of backlog no longer includes the 
run rate of consultancy projects. 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
The Group faces a number of risks and uncertainties that may 
adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity, financial 
position or future performance, not all of which are wholly within our 
control or known to us. Some such risks may currently be regarded 
as immaterial and could turn out to be material. We accept risk is an 
inherent part of doing business, and we manage the risks based on 
a balance of risk and reward determined through careful 
assessment of both the potential likelihood and impact as well as 
risk appetite. The Group faces a number of ongoing operational 
risks including credit and foreign exchange risk.  
Global economy 
The global economy remains fragile and it continues to be difficult 
to predict customer demand. Avanti is susceptible to decreased 
growth rates within high growth markets and/or continued economic 
and market downturn in developing markets. The effects could lead 
to a decline in demand and deteriorating financial results, which in 
turn could result in the Group not realising its financial targets.  
There are significant trade receivables with customers operating in 
the African and Middle East regions.These businesses are often 
operating in immature emerging markets for satellite communication 
services and may have cashflow difficulties due to the market and 
geopolitical environment in which they operate. 
Continued uncertainty regarding the terms of the UK’s exit from the 
EU may have some effect on our ability to attract suitable UK based 
staff. 
Foreign exchange risk 
We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange 
risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the pound Sterling and the Euro. In order to mitigate the foreign 
currency risk, the Group monitors the level at which natural hedges 
occur and continually reviews the need to enter into forward 
contracts in order to mitigate any material forecast exposure. Our 
reported results of operations and financial condition are affected 
by exchange rate fluctuations due to both transaction and 
translation risks. 
Interest rate risk 
We borrow in US Dollars and pounds Sterling at fixed rates of 
interest and do not seek to mitigate the effect of adverse 
movements in interest rates. Cash and deposits earn interest at 
fixed rates based on banks’ short-term treasury deposit rates. 
Short-term trade and other receivables are interest free. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a counterparty’s 
inability to repay or service debt in accordance with contractual 
terms. Credit risk includes the direct risk of default and the risk of 
deterioration of creditworthiness. We assess the credit quality of 
major customers before trading commences, taking into account 
customers’ financial position, past experience and other factors. 
Generally when a balance becomes more than 90 days past its due 
date, we consider that the amount will not be fully recoverable. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that we may have difficulty in obtaining 
funds in order to be able to meet both our day-to-day operating 
requirements and our debt servicing obligations. We manage our 
exposure to liquidity risk by regularly monitoring our liabilities. Cash 
and cash forecasts are monitored on a daily basis, and our cash 
requirements are met by a mixture of short term cash deposits, debt 
and finance leases. 
Future liquidity is also affected by the rate at which we fill the 
satellites and the yield achieved. 
Launch of HYLAS 4 
At this time the launch of HYLAS 4, the most advanced and efficient 
spacecraft of the Avanti fleet, is critical. Whilst the risk of launch 
failure is historically very low when using the Arianespace 5 launch 
vehicle, and the spacecraft is insured for $325 million, any failure 
would significantly impact the business model. A replacement 
vehicle would take approximately 30 months to procure. 
Post balance sheet events 
In July 2017 the Company drew down $100 million of the super 
senior facility agreed in June 2017. 
In November 2017 the Group terminated its contract with MOD of 
Indonesia and made provisions against the year-end debt of $16.8 
million. 
In December 2017 the Company announced that it had reached 
agreement with the majority of its bondholders and significant 
equity shareholders to repay the 2023 notes by issuing new shares 
in Avanti Communication Group plc. In addition the 2021 notes will 
extend their maturity by one year and the interest rate will be 
reduced to 9% for both cash and PIK (previously 12%). This 
remains subject to a formal consent solicitation process with the 
bondholders and a shareholder vote to be held in early 2018.  STRATEGIC REPORT

Going Concern 
As fully described in note 2 on pages 40  to 42, these accounts 
have been prepared on a going concern basis.  
In arriving at the conclusion, the Board of Directors were pleased to 
announce on 13 December 2017 that it proposed to convert the 
entire 2023 notes into equity, whilst at the same time extending the 
maturity to the 2021 notes by 12 months and reducing the cash and 
PIK coupons to 9%. These changes require the formal consent of 
both the debt holders and the shareholders. With a significant 
proportion of both parties signatories to the restructuring agreement 
and lock-up letters, the directors are confident that the restructuring 
will proceed.  
The Directors have concluded that, based on the group’s 
expectation that the Consent Solicitation for a financial restructure 
will be successful, together with the planned additional fund raise 
and substantial achievement of cash flow forecasts, the Directors 
believe that the Group will be able to have sufficient liquidity and 
will be able to meet its obligations as they fall due.  The Directors 
have accordingly formed the judgement that it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.  There 
can, however, be no certainty that the required consents will be 
received or that the refinancing will be successfully completed.  
Accordingly, successful completion of the refinancing, planned 
fund raise and the substantial achievement of cash flow forecasts 
represent a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on 
the group and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. The group and the parent company may, therefore, be 
unable to continue realising their assets and discharging their 
liabilities in the normal course of business, but the financial 
statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the 
going concern basis of preparation is inappropriate.

SUSTAINABILITY 
 
 
 
Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
12
 
Avanti recognises that the long term sustainability of the Group is 
secured by managing the current impacts of its operations and 
products, and anticipating the future global business environment. 
Avanti's sustainability strategy is designed to ensure that we have in 
place the following: 
 Responsible business practices to underpin business activities 
and support employees in making the right decisions to drive 
business performance; 
 A safe work environment for employees; and 
 A diverse range of talented employees with a broad range of 
skills and capabilities to deliver against global customer 
requirements. 
The Chief Executive, supported by the Board, has overall 
responsibility for the Group's ongoing commitment to sustainability 
to ensure that there are appropriate policies, systems, reporting 
structures and metrics in place to achieve the Group's sustainability 
objectives. All Avanti employees also have some responsibility for 
sustainability, whether it is in their interactions with service 
providers or making efficiencies to support our environmental aims. 
The effectiveness of policies and processes is monitored and 
reviewed on an ongoing basis and risks or opportunities are 
assessed and managed. 
We use targets and metrics to measure our performance and to 
enhance future performance by learning from our past successes 
and challenges. Avanti evaluates possible sustainability issues 
based on their relevance to our current operations and the potential 
future impact on the business in order to ascertain our priorities. 
Priorities may change as the business develops and as we receive 
feedback from our stakeholders, and we therefore review these on 
a regular basis. For areas identified as having a high importance, 
we have either already developed strategies and have controls in 
place and are reporting on performance, or we are developing 
more detailed strategies within our existing systems to focus on 
specific aspects. By monitoring our performance in this way we will 
also get valuable feedback for use in the continual improvement of 
our policies, processes and procedures. Stakeholder engagement 
is important to Avanti. 
Talent/Avanti people 
To have a sustainable business, Avanti must attract, develop and 
retain talent and manage it across the business. Avanti contributes 
to the wider community through the course of its business by 
creating employment, offering work experience and graduate 
training opportunities to young people and by investing in good 
causes that are relevant to the business. 
Attract and retain 
Like many companies operating in the technology industry in the 
UK, Avanti has concerns about current and future talent shortages 
in the technology and engineering sectors. This is a particular issue 
as the labour market becomes more fluid. Maximising the available 
talent pool is at the heart of our recruitment strategy and Avanti 
uses a diverse range of recruitment methods to achieve this, 
including; utilising social media and our own database of interested 
candidates, harnessing our employees' networks, online 
advertising, and building relationships with universities and other 
groups. 
The measure of voluntary employee turnover provides insight into 
retention at Avanti. Avanti monitors this on a monthly basis and 
regular feedback ensures that any potential issues are identified 
and dealt with. Avanti's target for voluntary turnover (over a 12 
month period) is under 15%. This level reflects the current average 
levels of turnover experienced in London-based commercial 
businesses, with an appropriate level of churn to refresh the talent 
base. 
To improve retention, Avanti has developed a programme to 
increase employee engagement. This change has had a positive 
impact on retention. In the UK currently only 6% of the engineering 
workforce is female. Avanti continues to buck this trend. Engineers 
make up 60% of Avanti's workforce and of those 11.6% are female. 
At Avanti we continue to actively promote the industry to young 
people and women through work with universities and colleges and 
to promote fair and open recruitment and selection practices. 
Avanti employs people from 33 countries speaking more than 27 
languages. Through encouraging diversity within its workforce, 
Avanti aims to reflect better the diversity of its customer base in 
order to respond better to its demands. 
Working with young people 
Avanti aims to encourage the workforce of the future by supporting 
science, technology and engineering education through building 
links with local colleges and universities, in particular through 
involvement with the National Space Centre. Avanti also offers 
internships and voluntary work experience placements as well as 
providing expert technical talks to universities.   STRATEGIC REPORT

Avanti key behaviours 
Avanti's key behaviours set out the principles and standards of 
business conduct expected of all employees wherever they operate 
and in whatever role. These behaviours are embedded into our 
induction and performance review processes. Avanti's key 
behaviours play a large role in ensuring that the strong values of the 
Company are maintained as it grows in size. Avanti's culture is an 
important factor in driving quality and flexibility for customers and 
other stakeholders in the business. 
Human rights 
Avanti requires that its business be conducted with honesty and 
integrity, and in full compliance with all applicable laws. Company 
policies establish clear ethical standards and guidelines for how we 
do business and establish accountability. The Company has clear 
accountability mechanisms in place to monitor and report on 
compliance with these directives. Additionally, Avanti supports and 
upholds the elimination of discriminatory practices with respect to 
employment and occupation, and promotes and embraces diversity 
in all aspects of its business operations. 
Developing talent 
Robust appraisal and performance management processes are in 
place to ensure that Avanti is able to deliver quality and flexibility 
throughout all areas of work by identifying and developing skills and 
knowledge within the business and empowering employees to 
suggest improvements and innovation. Avanti offers development 
opportunities across the business in technical and management 
skills to ensure that our workforce is ready to adapt to changes in 
technology and markets. In the 12 months leading up to July, Avanti 
provided over 400 training sessions for employees and the 
development activity is paying off. Avanti is proud of its record of 
developing talent and promoting from within; in the last year, 18% of 
all vacancies were filled by internal promotion. 
Key next steps 
Avanti continues to develop and diversify its recruitment practices 
and grow its links with relevant universities and other groups to 
promote engineering and the satellite industry. We also continue to 
review and improve our practices and policies to ensure that we 
remain an attractive employer as the labour market is predicted to 
become more challenging, and that our workforce is flexible and 
able to adapt quickly to change and growth. 
Health and safety 
Avanti wants employees to work in a safe, healthy environment. To 
achieve this we continue to review and update our policies, 
procedures and practices to assess and mitigate against any risks. 
Avanti has a robust health and safety audit and improvement 
process, and encourages employees to report potential issues and 
suggest improvements. 
Environment 
At Avanti we feel an environmental responsibility to both our service 
providers and their wider communities. Fortunately, our technology 
enables us and our service providers to behave in an 
environmentally responsible way. Services and applications such 
as teleworking, video conferencing, distance learning and 
ecommerce allow service providers to exchange information and 
ideas without actually travelling, saving energy and reducing 
pollution. Today, service providers can use our wireless services to 
make the distribution of goods more efficient; help reduce energy 
use in workshops, offices and homes; and take advantage of 
telemedicine and distance learning. Reducing the environmental 
impact Avanti encourages all employees to avoid all unnecessary 
travel by providing full telephone or video conferencing in meeting 
rooms at Avanti sites. Employees are expected to consider the 
necessity of their journeys and to use alternative methods of 
communication where possible, such as remote accreditation of 
partners and supporting partners via video conferencing. We also 
carefully monitor energy usage and waste in our head office in 
London, and hope to roll out this monitoring across other sites in the 
near future. 
Stakeholders 
Avanti's principal stakeholders include investors, employees, 
partners, suppliers, government and non-government organisations 
and the communities in which it operates. Avanti aims to 
communicate openly with stakeholders about its business in order 
to better understand their views and concerns, and explain the 
Company's approach. 
Organisational departments 
The structure at Avanti is designed to promote flexibility and 
excellent customer service by encouraging accountability and 
allowing for focused working. This is achieved by grouping the 
functions whose main purposes are customer facing (the partner 
support, deployment and logistics teams), sales and revenue 
generation (marketing, sales and pre-sales) and technical 
operations and innovation (procurement, satellite operations, 
ground operations and networks). Interdepartmental working is 
encouraged through the use of project teams and regular meetings 
of the management team, as well as regular cross-Company 
training.

Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
Avanti firmly supports the upholding of good principles 
of corporate governance, not only because it is 
required for compliance purposes but because 
effective corporate governance serves to ensure that 
the business is run properly and in the interests of all 
of its stakeholders. 
The Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) recognises that it is 
accountable to shareholders for the Company’s activities and that it 
is responsible for the effectiveness of corporate governance 
practices. It remains committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance and, whilst the Company is AIM listed and 
therefore not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’), the Board seeks to comply with the Code in all 
material respects wherever it is practical to do so having regard to 
the size of the Company and the resources available to it.  
As a Board, we monitor closely for developments in legislation, 
regulation and industry guidelines to ensure that our corporate 
governance policies are kept up to date and that the Board 
committees take into account all of the latest guidance in their areas 
of activity.  
The Board takes all appropriate measures to ensure that no conflict 
of interest can exist between members of the Board and other 
stakeholders in the Company.  
Throughout the year ended 30 June 2017, the Board considers that 
the Company complied in all material respects with those parts of 
the Code that it considers appropriate. This Corporate Governance 
Report, the Report of the Board, the Audit Committee Report, and 
the Remuneration Report detail how the Company has applied the 
main principles of the Code..

Role of the Board  
The Board has a collective duty to promote the long term success 
of the Company for its shareholders. The Board sets the Company’s 
strategy and ensures that the necessary resources are in place to 
achieve the strategic priorities.  
In determining the long term strategy and objectives of the 
Company, the Board takes into account its duties and 
responsibilities not just to its shareholders but also to customers, 
employees and other stakeholders and makes its decisions 
objectively. It reviews management and financial performance, 
monitors the delivery of strategy and achievement of objectives and 
works within a rigorous framework of internal controls and risk 
management. The Board develops and promotes the collective 
vision of the Company’s purpose, objectives, values and key 
behaviours.  
Composition of the Board  
The Board currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, seven 
other Non-Executive Directors and three Executive Directors. 
During the financial year, Richard Vos, Michael Walker and 
Charmaine Eggberry stepped down as Non-Executive Directors 
and Richard Mastoloni, Craig Chobor, Peter Reed, Michael Leitner 
and Alan Harper were appointed as Non-Executive Directors. On 1 
September 2017, after the financial year end, Christopher 
McLaughlin was appointed as a Non-Executive Director. The 
balance of the Board, together with the advice sought from other 
members of senior management and the Company’s external 
advisors, ensures that no individual has unfettered powers of 
decision. 
Chairman and the Chief Executive  
The Board is chaired by Paul Walsh who provides leadership that 
demonstrates the values and behaviours of the Company. The 
Chairman is responsible for creating the conditions for overall 
Board and individual Director effectiveness. He ensures that both 
Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors make available 
sufficient time to execute their duties in an appropriate manner, that 
all Directors receive sufficient financial and operational information 
and that there is proper debate at Board meetings. He is also 
responsible, in consultation with the Chief Executive and the 
Company Secretary, for setting the agenda for the Board’s 
meetings.  
The Chief Executive is supported by the Finance Director and the 
Technical Director and he is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Company. He provides leadership to the 
Company to successfully plan and execute the objectives and 
strategy agreed by the Board. The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are separate with each having clearly defined duties and 
responsibilities. On 10 August 2017, David Williams resigned as 
Chief Executive and was replaced by Alan Harper as interim Chief 
Executive. 
Non-Executive Directors  
The Company benefits from the extensive experience of the Non-
Executive Directors in areas critical to the long term future success 
of the Company, encompassing a deep understanding of the 
industry, technology, corporate strategy, finance and investment. 
The Non-Executive Directors help the Executive Directors by 
contributing independent challenge and rigour to the Board’s 
deliberations and assisting in the development of the Company’s 
strategy. In addition, they are responsible for monitoring the 
performance of the Executive Directors against agreed goals and 
objectives. Their views are essential in overseeing the performance 
of the Company.  
Induction and ongoing training  
All Directors have access to advice from the Company Secretary 
and independent professionals at the Company’s expense. Training 
is available for Directors as necessary. New Directors receive an 
induction programme and all the Directors are encouraged to 
continue professional education programmes.  
Matters reserved for the Board  
The Board recognises that, to ensure the long term success of the 
Company, certain specific matters should be reserved for the 
consideration and decision of the Directors alone. Decisions 
specifically reserved for approval by the Board are formally 
recorded and include:  
 Annual and interim accounts and Financial Statements;  
 Dividend policy;  
 Board appointments;  
 Company strategy and annual operating budget;

 Changes to the Company’s management and control structure;  
 Major capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals;  
 Treasury policies;  
 Risk management strategy;  
 Company corporate governance policy; and  
 Environmental, health and safety and sustainability policies.

During the year, the Chairman continued the practice of maintaining 
a 12 month agenda for Board and committee meetings. Agenda 
items included permanent items such as progress reports from the 
Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, as well as periodic 
items such as updates from the Board Committees, review of the 
risk register and internal controls, strategy and succession 
planning. Whenever a Director is a related party or interested in a 
particular transaction being considered by the Board, the Chairman 
will ensure that the relevant Director will recuse himself/herself from 
any decisions made in relation to that transaction.  
In advance of each meeting, the Board is provided with monthly 
management reports and other relevant information in a timely 
manner and in a form and quality that it considers appropriate.  
The Chairman and the Board have confidence that the way in which 
the Board meetings are conducted ensures that they cover all the 
matters required to be discussed and that sufficient time is allowed 
for discussion of each matter at the most appropriate meeting in the 
year, enabling the members of the Board to discharge their duties 
as Directors effectively.  
The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and is available 
to advise on any corporate governance issues that may arise.  
Re-appointment of Directors 
All Directors are required to retire every three years and may offer 
themselves for re-appointment, which is not automatic. As a 
Company with a long-term growth strategy, it is appropriate for 
Directors to serve on the Board for more than a single term, subject 
to continuing satisfactory performance.  
 
Board Committees  
The Board has established a number of committees to assist in the 
discharge of its responsibilities. The principal committees are the 
Audit Committee, the Nominations Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee. The responsibilities of each of these 
Board committees are set out in their individual Terms of Reference. 
The roles and responsibilities of the committees are discussed 
further below.  
Committee meetings are held independently of Board meetings and 
invitations to attend are extended by the committee Chairman to 
other Directors, the Company’s advisors and management as 
appropriate. 
Audit Committee  
The Audit Committee is comprised of four Non-Executive Directors: 
Paul Johnson, Andy Green, Craig Chobor and Richard Mastoloni. 
The Committee is chaired by Paul Johnson. Through their other 
business activities, each member of the Committee has significant 
experience in financial matters. The Company considers that the 
composition of the Audit Committee is in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Further information on the activities of 
the Committee is set out in the Audit Committee Report on pages 21 
to 22.  
Nominations Committee  
The Nominations Committee is comprised of two Non-Executive 
Directors: Paul Walsh and Andy Green. It is chaired by Paul Walsh. 
For further information on the activities of the Committee please

Remuneration Committee  
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of four Non-Executive 
Directors: Paul Walsh, Andy Green, Peter Reed and Michael 
Leitner. It is chaired by Andy Green.  
Executive Directors and senior management attend Remuneration 
Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chairman 
only.  
The Remuneration Committee meets according to the Company’s 
requirements at least twice a year.  
The Remuneration Committee determines, within agreed Terms of 
Reference, specific remuneration packages for the Chairman, the 
Executive Directors and the officers of the Company. This includes 
implementation of Company share incentive plans. In accordance 
with the Committee’s Terms of Reference, no Director may 
participate in discussions relating to his or her own terms and 
conditions of service or remuneration.  
With regard to the remuneration policy, the Committee considers:  
 The pay scales applied to each Director’s package;  
 The proportion of the different types of reward within each 
package;  
 The period within which performance related elements become 
payable;  
 What proportion of rewards should be related to measurable 
performance or enhanced shareholder value, and the balance 
between short and long-term performance elements; and  
 Transparency of Directors’ remuneration in the annual Financial 
Statements.  
Further information on the activities of the Committee is set out in 
the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 24 to 26. 
Relations with shareholders  
The Board recognises the importance of establishing and 
maintaining good relationships with all of the Company’s 
shareholders. During the period under review, various Directors 
have met with analysts and institutional shareholders to keep them 
informed of significant developments and report to the Board 
accordingly on the views of these stakeholders.  
The Interim Report and the Annual Report and Accounts are the 
primary means used by the Board for communication during the 
year with all of the Company’s shareholders. The Board also 
recognises the importance of the internet as a means of 
communicating widely, immediately and cost effectively and a 
Company website (www.avantiplc.com) is maintained to facilitate 
communications with shareholders. 
Information available online includes copies of the full and half year 
Financial Statements, press releases and Company news, 
corporate governance information and key dates in the financial 
calendar.  
The Board is committed to the constructive use of the Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’) as a forum to meet with shareholders and 
to hear their views and answer their questions. The 2017 AGM was 
held at 9.00 am on 13 December 2017. A further General Meeting 
will be convened in early 2018 to lay the Annual Report and 
Accounts before shareholders and approve the re-election and 
remuneration of the Company’s auditors.  
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM and General 
Meetings and to participate in proceedings by asking questions 
during the formal part of the meeting, voting on resolutions put to 
the meeting and providing Board members with their views in 
informal discussions after the meeting. Notices of all AGMs and 
General Meetings are sent to shareholders and are also available  
to download on the Company’s website.  
Financial reporting  
At the half year and the year end, all operating Group companies 
are required to produce Financial Statements to comply with local 
accounting regulations and to produce sufficient information to 
enable the central finance team to produce IFRS-compliant 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Board presents a balanced and understandable assessment of 
the Company’s position and prospects in all interim and price 
sensitive public reports whilst also reporting to regulators all 
information required to be presented by statutory requirements. 
Internal control and risk management  
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company’s system of 
internal control to safeguard Company assets and shareholders’ 
investments. The risk management process and systems of internal 
control are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure in order to achieve the Company’s objectives.  
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control for the year ended 30 June 2017 and up to the date of the 
signing of the Annual Report and Accounts. The Board will continue 
to develop and implement internal control procedures appropriate 
to the Company’s nature and scale.  
The Company does not have an internal audit function due to the 
small size of the Company’s administrative function and the high 
level of Director review and authorisation of transactions. The Audit 
Committee believes that these internal controls are adequate for the 
Group’s current size and does not feel that a separate internal audit 
function is currently warranted. This situation is kept under regular 
review.   GOVERNANCE 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT continued

Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
The Board recognises that an essential part of its responsibility is 
the effective safeguarding of assets, the proper recognition of 
liabilities and the accurate reporting of results. The Company has a 
comprehensive system for regular reporting to the Board. This 
includes an annual planning and budgeting system with budgets 
approved by the Board.  
The financial reporting system compares against budget and prior 
year, and reconsiders its financial year forecast on a monthly basis.  
The Board has established a formal policy of authorisation setting 
out matters which require its approval and certain authorities 
delegated to the Executive Directors. 
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control are as 
follows:  
 Management responsibility and accountability: There are clearly 
defined management responsibilities, reporting lines and limits 
of authority. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director meet 
regularly with the Executive Directors and other members of 
senior management to review progress on financial, commercial, 
operational, supply chain, HR, health, safety and environmental 
issues as well as regulatory and legal compliance matters.  
 Strategy and planning: The Company updates its strategic plan 
each year and this is approved by the Board.  
 Budgeting and reporting: Detailed management accounts are 
prepared each month, consolidated and reviewed in detail with 
senior management.  
 Expenditure approval: Authorisation and control procedures are 
in place for capital expenditure and other major projects. There 
is also a process to review capital expenditure projects post 
completion to highlight any issues and improve future projects. 
Authorisation procedures for operating costs and contractual 
commitments are reviewed regularly.  
 Independence of the finance function: The finance function is 
encouraged to act independently of general management in the 
course of its preparation of monthly accounts and exercising of 
control procedures.  
 Insurance and risk management policies: This includes a formal 
annual risk review report to the Board. Regular meetings are 
held with insurance and risk advisors to assess the risks 
throughout the Group.  
 Documented policies: There are documented policies for a 
range of areas including HR matters, expenditure, treasury and 
financial reporting.  
 Cash: The cash and debt position at Group and operational level 
is monitored daily and any variances from forecast levels are 
investigated thoroughly. Working capital balances are reviewed 
on a monthly basis at Group level, and any significant variances 
are analysed and investigated.  
 Effectiveness: The Board continually reviews the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control and risk management procedures 
throughout the year. 
Ethics  
The Company prides itself on carrying out its business in a fair, 
honest and open manner, ensuring that it complies with all relevant 
laws and regulations.  
Under the Companies Act 2006, a Director of a company must 
avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts or may possibly conflict with the 
interests of the company. The Company has a formal procedure in 
place to manage the disclosure consideration and, if appropriate, 
the authorisation of any such possible conflict. Directors are aware 
of the requirement to notify the Board as soon as they become 
aware of any possible future conflict or a material change to an 
existing authorisation. Only Directors who have no interest in the 
matter being considered are able to take the relevant decision.  
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments, the interests 
of the Directors in the share capital of the Company and options to 
subscribe for shares in the Company are provided in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 26.  
Bribery Act 2010  
The Board performs an ongoing assessment of the risk environment 
and has implemented a framework to ensure that the Company 
trades in compliance with the UK Bribery Act 2010 and all other 
relevant anti-bribery and corruption legislation. 
Modern Slavery Act 2015 
The Company has taken, and is continuing to take, steps to ensure 
that modern slavery is not taking place within its business or supply 
chain. A zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery has 
been implemented and the Company is fully committed to acting 
ethically, transparently and with integrity in all business dealings.  
The Company’s commitment to conducting business in an ethical 
and transparent manner is reflected in several of its policies, 
including its Anti-bribery Policy, Code of Conduct, New Supplier 
Selection Policy and Supplier Policy. These policies not only set the 
values expected of the Company’s own staff but also the 
behaviours and values required in the Company’s supply chain.  
To ensure all service providers comply with these values, the 
Company undertakes due diligence on all new and existing 
suppliers. In addition, the Company contracts on the basis that 
these organisations have in place similar policies to its own, 
ensuring no part of their business operations contradicts the 
Company’s ethics.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  
 
 
Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Three of the four members of the Audit Committee are independent 
Non-Executive Directors and the majority have significant, recent 
and relevant financial experience. The Board is confident that the 
collective experience of the Audit Committee members enables 
them, as a group, to act as an effective Committee. 
By invitation, the meetings of the Audit Committee may be attended 
by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance Director 
and deputy CFO. The KPMG LLP audit engagement partner is 
present at the audit committee meetings to ensure full 
communication of matters relating to the audit. The Chairman of the 
Audit Committee meets regularly with the Group Finance Director 
and the external Auditor. 
The Audit Committee has particular responsibility for monitoring the 
financial reporting process, the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
operation of internal controls and risk management and the integrity 
of the Financial Statements. This includes a review of significant 
issues and judgements, policies and disclosures. Its duties include 
keeping under review the scope and results of the audit and its cost 
effectiveness, consideration of management’s response to any 
major external audit recommendations and the independence and 
objectivity of the external Auditor.  
During the year to 30 June 2017 the Audit Committee reviewed and 
endorsed, prior to submission to the Board, half year and full year 
Financial Statements, interim management statements and results 
announcements. It considered internal management reports and 
risk management updates, agreed external audit plans, received 
updates on management responses to audit recommendations  
and approved the review of accounting policies. Progress on 
implementation of processes to meet the requirements of the UK 
Bribery Act 2010 was also provided to the Committee. Following  
the issue of high yield bonds in October 2013, the Company 
commenced limited quarterly reporting and the Audit Committee 
additionally required KPMG to carry out reviews on revenue 
recognition and analytical reviews of the quarterly Financial 
Statements with management. The Audit Committee also reviewed 
the progress on the Company’s preparations for GDPR with the 
Company’s General Counsel. 
 
Significant accounting matters 
During 2017, the Audit Committee considered the significant 
accounting matters described below. In addressing these issues 
the Committee considered the appropriateness of management’s 
accounting estimates and key judgements, outlined in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The Committee discussed these 
with the external auditor during the year and, where appropriate, 
details of how they have been addressed are provided in the 
Independent Auditors’ Report on pages 31 to 34. 
1. Recoverability of trade receivables and accrued income  
The group has a significant level of trade receivables and 
accrued income, including balances that may prove 
challenging to recover due to the market and geopolitical 
environment in which our customers operate.  Management’s 
consideration of whether or not to provide against amounts due 
from customers reflects a key judgement. 
2. Impairment of space assets (HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2)  
The group assesses its space assets for impairment by 
reviewing forecast performance over the remaining life of the 
assets in order to estimate the recoverable amounts.  There is 
an inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting 
the future cash flows on which this impairment assessment is 
based. 
3. Revenue recognition on multi-element arrangements 
Where the group enters into multi element contracts, judgement 
is required in determining the relative fair value of the delivered 
and undelivered elements on the contract. 
4. Revenue recognition on Government services contracts 
The group enters into fixed price contracts with customers, and 
recognises revenue based on a stage of completion calculation. 
The subjective inputs into the stage of completion calculation 
rely on management judgement. 
5. Recoverability of deferred tax assets 
The group has significant deferred tax assets.  In determining 
whether deferred tax assets are or are not recognised, 
management are required to estimate future taxable profits.    
There is an inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting future 
performance of the business. 
6. Recoverability of parent company’s investments in and 
receivables due from subsidiaries 
The carrying amount of the parent company’s investments in 
and receivables due from subsidiaries is significant. There  
is a risk that these amounts may not recoverable due to the 
performance of subsidiary entities.  There is an inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting the future 
cash flows on which this impairment assessment is based.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
Going Concern 
As more fully explained in note 2 to the financial statements, in 
determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the 
Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. 
In assessing the Group’s ability to meet its obligation as they fall 
due, management prepared cash flow forecasts based on the 
business plan for a period of 12 months.  Management considered 
various downside scenarios to test the Group’s resilience against 
operational risk including: 
 Slower build in fleet/satellite utilisation 
 Planned revenue from exploitation of spectrum rights and 
satellite interim missions doesn’t materialise 
However, were those downside scenarios to materialise, 
Management would take mitigating actions, notably the ability  
to PIK interest payable in October 2018 on the 2021 Notes. 
Management therefore concluded that the Group’s Capital 
Structure after the planned financial restructuring comprising of the 
debt for equity swap, and amendment to the economic terms of the 
PIK Toggle Notes, together with the planned additional fund raise 
and the substantial achievement of cash flow forecasts, provides 
sufficient headroom to cushion against downside operational risks.  
The Committee challenged management on the key assumptions 
used in the cash projections and sensitivities applied to arrive at a 
downside scenario. The Committee was satisfied that the key 
assumptions had been appropriately scrutinised, stress tested and 
were sufficiently robust. The Committee was further satisfied that 
the going concern disclosures in the financial statements were 
appropriate and that an appropriate basis of preparation of the 
financial statements had been arrived at.  
However, the need for a successful completion of the financial 
restructuring (announced on 13 December 2017) is conditional 
upon the Scheme of Arrangement and Consent Solicitation 
processes in addition to certain shareholder resolutions and this, in 
addition to the completion of a minimum fund raise of $30m 
following the completion of the aforementioned restructuring and 
the substantial achievement of cash flow forecasts represent a 
material uncertainty about the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern as explained in note 2 to the financial statements. 
The auditor explained their audit procedures on management’s 
going concern assessment and considered the Group’s disclosure 
on the subject. On the basis of their audit work, the auditor 
considered that the going concern basis of preparation of the 
financial statement is appropriate and included an emphasis of 
matter in relation to the material uncertainty regarding the need for 
a successful completion of the financial restructuring, a minimum 
fund raise of $30m following the completion of the aforementioned 
restructuring and the substantial achievement of cash flow 
forecasts to enable the settlement of certain interest payments by 
the issue of Notes. Refer to the auditor’s report on pages 31 to 34 
for the auditor’s opinion on the going concern assumption. 
External Auditor  
Auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded through a 
variety of mechanisms. To ensure the auditor’s independence, the 
Committee annually reviews the Company’s relationship with 
KPMG. Following the review in 2016, the Company concluded that  
it continues to have an objective and professional relationship with 
KPMG and that there are sufficient controls and processes in place 
to ensure the required level of independence. In addition, the 
auditor is required to review and confirm its independence to the 
Committee on a regular basis.  
Non-audit services  
The Company’s auditor may also be employed where, as a result  
of its position as auditor, it either must, or is best placed to, perform 
the work in question. 
Conclusion  
Following its review, the Committee was of the opinion that the 2017 
Annual Report and Accounts is representative of the year and 
presents a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing 
the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy.

The Nominations Committee comprises independent Non-Executive 
Directors. It meets as and when necessary and details of the 
membership of the Committee are shown on pages 14 to 15.  
The Committee has responsibility for nominating to the Board 
candidates for appointment as Directors, bearing in mind the need 
for diversity and a broad representation of skills across the Board, 
and its principal responsibility is to ensure that the Board comprises 
individuals with the most appropriate balance of experience, skills 
and knowledge to help and support the Company strategy. 
The Nominations Committee will also make recommendations to  
the Board concerning the re-appointment of any independent  
Non-Executive Director at the conclusion of his or her specified 
term, the election and re-election of any Director by shareholders 
and changes to senior management, including Executive Directors. 
The Nominations Committee gives full consideration to succession 
planning in the course of its work, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Company, how to take 
account of diversity and what skills and expertise are needed on 
the Board and from senior management in the future. As a result, 
job specifications, search processes and selection criteria are 
focused on appointing candidates who not only meet criteria for the 
role but who can also offer different perspectives. 
In the financial year to 30 June 2017, the Committee, in consultation 
with a number of the other Non-Executive Directors, met a number 
of times and was heavily involved in the appointment of the new 
Directors to the Board

The Remuneration Committee comprises independent Non-Executive Directors only. The Committee, on behalf of the Board, meets as and 
when necessary to review and approve, as appropriate, the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management and major 
remuneration plans for the Company. 
The Committee consists of Andrew Green (Chairman) (who replaced Richard Vos in January 2017) Paul Walsh, Peter Reed (appointed in 
January 2017) and Michael Leitner (appointed in January 2017). 
The Committee thanks Richard Vos for his knowledgeable contribution over the past several years.  
During the year, the Remuneration Committee met four times. 
Remuneration policy 
The Company’s policy on remuneration of Directors is to attract, retain and motivate the best people, recognising the input they make to 
the ongoing success of the business. Consistent with this policy, the remuneration and benefits package awarded to Directors is intended 
to be competitive and comprises a mix of performance related and non-performance related elements designed to incentivise Directors in 
the short and longer term, and align their interests with those of shareholders. Their remuneration accordingly consists of base pay, annual 
bonus, Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), share options, pension contributions and other benefits such as health care. 
Under the Company’s LTIP which came into operation in July 2013, shares will vest if specific targets are met after a fixed period of years 
after they are allocated. The targets set by the Remuneration Committee reflect the desired performance of the Company as it develops 
from a ‘start-up’ to a more mature business. 
Remuneration 2017 
The remuneration of the Directors for the year is set out below, the previous year’s figures being shown for comparison. Remuneration is 
paid in Sterling, but reported in US Dollars, the exchange rates used being USD 1.27 in 2017 and USD 1.47 in 2016.

Basic salary 
Base salary is set by the Committee and reviewed annually, taking into account an individual’s performance and experience measured by 
appraisal and market practice. The Executive Directors did not receive a base salary increase for the year ended 30 June 2017. 
Pension 
The Company does not operate a specific pension scheme for the Executive Directors. The Executives are entitled to a Company 
contribution to their private pensions equal to 12.5% of their base salary. All Directors are entitled to participate in the Group workplace 
pension scheme. 
Cash bonus 
Bonus awards, which are not pensionable, are made to the Executive Directors based on Group financial and individual performance.  
Bonus payments are generally only payable if the Group meets a specific target threshold. This threshold his was not achieved for 2017 
but certain ex gratia payments were made in February 2017 to the Executive Directors in recognition of their work in completing the 
financial restructuring. Personal performance is appraised against the achievement of challenging objectives set at the start of each 
financial year, and is linked to the Group’s strategic and operational performance.

Directors’ Long Term Incentive Plans  
LTIPs have been established by the Group with approval of the Remuneration Committee and with the advice and assistance of Deloitte 
Touche Tohmatsu Limited to reward and incentivise the Executive Directors and senior managers of the Group. 
All unvested shares are held in the Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). The LTIP allocations are in separate sub funds within the EBT and are 
subject to automatic revocation if certain criteria are not met and continue to be revocable for the entire Trust period. 
The total allocation to the executive is subject to specific performance criteria, which must be met a fixed number of years after the grant. 
Currently, the criteria are twofold: 
Two thirds of an award – ‘the Revenue Part’ – or a proportion thereof will vest if specific revenue targets are achieved or bettered. Revenue 
will be based on the Group’s audited Financial Statements for the relevant financial year. The Revenue Part will lapse to the extent it does 
not vest. 
One third of an award – ‘the Share Price Part’ – or a proportion thereof will vest if the three-month average share price to 30 June in the 
relevant financial year is equal to or above a specified amount. In the event of any variation in the share capital of the Company by way of 
capitalisation or rights issue, consolidation, subdivision or reduction or otherwise, the Remuneration Committee shall make an appropriate 
adjustment to the share price targets to reflect this. 
The Share Price Part will lapse to the extent it does not vest in accordance with the schedule.  
In 2017, the Remuneration Committee determined that the criteria for the 2017 awards had not been met and that the awards should 
therefore lapse. The Committee decided to review the relevance of the current LTIP scheme to the Group’s longer-term ambitions prior to 
cnsideration of any further LTIP awards. No LTIP awards were made in 2017. 
Current allocations are as set out below::

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
 
 
Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
27
 
The Directors have pleasure in presenting their Annual Report 
together with the audited Financial Statements for the year ended 
30 June 2017. 
Principal activities  
The principal activity of the Group is the commercial exploitation of 
its space and network assets. These assets include its spectrum 
rights, satellites, intellectual property and ground station assets. 
Avanti charges its service provider customers for the use of its 
network and other assets in a number of ways: broadband 
packages, managed capacity, fully integrated project fees, raw 
capacity, pure spectrum and a number of other product categories 
and charging models to suit customer and market circumstances.  
The services are principally provided via Ka-band satellites.  
Avanti had three satellites (HYLAS 1, HYLAS 2 and ARTEMIS) and 
one hosted payload (HYLAS 2B) in-orbit during the year. A further 
two satellites are under construction (HYLAS 3 and HYLAS 4). The 
ARTEMIS satellite was re-orbited post year-end on 15 December 
2017.  HYLAS 3 is a payload on ESA’s EDRS-C satellite and is 
scheduled for launch before the end of calendar 2018. Construction 
of HYLAS 4 commenced in August 2014 and the satellite is 
scheduled for launch in March 2018.  
A review of the Group’s business and developments during the year 
is included in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s 
Review and the Strategic Report.  
Going Concern 
In determining the appropriate basis for preparation of the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to consider if it is appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting. 
Full disclosure of the Directors deliberations to determine whether  
it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting  
is provided in note 2 to the financial statements on page 40. 
In summary, the Directors have concluded that based on the 
Group’s expectation that the Consent Solicitation and UK Scheme 
of Arrangement processes for the financial restructuring described 
in note 2 will be successful, that a minimum fund raise of $30m is 
completed following the completion of the aforementioned 
restructuring and the substantial achievement of cash flow 
forecasts,  that the Group will be able to have sufficient liquidity and 
will be able to meet its obligations as they fall due, and accordingly 
have formed the judgement that it is appropriate to prepare the 
financial statements on a going concern basis. There can, however, 
be no certainty that the required consents or schemes will be 
received or approved or that the refinancing will be successfully 
completed. Accordingly, the factors listed above represent a 
material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group 
and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
Business review and key performance indicators  
Avanti operates two performance indicators in order to give 
investors better insight into the progress that the business is 
making. The first performance indicator is Top-20 Customer 
Bandwidth Revenue Growth, which helps to track Avanti’s growth 
trajectory from core service sales, excluding non-recurring items, 
and is calculated by comparing the revenues from Avanti’s current 
leading customers on a last 12 month basis, to the 12 months 
preceding that.  
The second performance indicator is Fleet Utilisation, which helps 
to track capacity uptake and gives an indication of revenue 
potential when Avanti’s fleet is mature, and is calculated by dividing 
average utilised capacity by total available capacity for the fleet. 
A review of the Group’s business and developments during the 
year, including these KPIs, is included in the Chairman’s Statement 
and the Chief Executive’s Review within the Strategic Report. 
Results and dividends  
The results for the year ended 30 June 2017 are shown on page 35. 
No equity dividend was paid in the year ended 30 June 2017 (2016: 
$nil). No final dividend is proposed at the year-end (2016: $nil). The 
loss for the year transferred to shareholders’ funds was $65.2m 
(2016: loss of $68.7m). The net asset position at year end is 
$133.7m (2016: $201.5m).  
Share capital  
The Company issued 14,739,599 new Ordinary Shares during the 
year ended 30 June 2017 (2016: 5,593,000 new shares). Details of 
the Company’s share capital are given in Note 25 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Qualitative and quantitative disclosures about interest, 
foreign exchange, credit and liquidity risks 
A discussion of the Company’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies and the exposure of the Company to 
interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and liquidity risk is included 
on pages 72 to 74 in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.  
Research and development  
The Company continues to invest in new services and technology 
through its research and development programmes which can lead 
to profitable exploitation of Avanti’s satellite capacity. These include 
pure research into new products as well as developing those 
services which have been demonstrated to have a profitable 
business case.   GOVERNANCE

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
30
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.   
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year.  As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the  
EU (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements  
on the same basis. 
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and  
of their profit or loss for that period.  In preparing each of the  
Group and parent Company financial statements, the directors  
are required to:   
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;   
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant 
and reliable;   
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU;   
 assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as  
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and   
 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006.  They are responsible for such internal control 
as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.   
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ 
 Report that complies with that law and those regulations.   
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website.  Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
 
 
 
 
 
Alan Harper 
Chief Executive  INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF AVANTI COMMUNICATIONS GROUP PLC  
 
31 
Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
1. Our opinion is unmodified   
We have audited the financial statements of Avanti Communications 
Group plc (“the Company”) for the year ended 30 June 2017 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement  
of Financial Position, consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the related  
notes, including the accounting policies in note 2.   
In our opinion:   
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 
2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;   
 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);   
 the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and   
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance  
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.   
Basis for opinion   
We conducted our audit in accordance with International  
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our 
ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Group  
in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion.  
2. Material uncertainty related to going concern   
We draw attention to note 2 to the financial statements which 
indicates that the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the successful 
completion of the financial restructuring announced on 13 
December 2017 (that is itself conditional upon the Consent 
Solicitation and Scheme of Arrangement process, which requires 
approval of existing debt and equity holders), the negotiation of an 
additional fund raise of $30m following the completion of the 
aforementioned restructuring, and the substantial achievement of 
cash flow forecasts. These events and conditions, along with the 
other matters explained in note 2 to the financial statements, 
constitute a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on 
the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
The risk – Disclosure quality  
Clear and full disclosure of the of the facts and the directors’ 
rationale for the use of the going concern basis of preparation, 
including that there is a related material uncertainty, is a key 
financial statement disclosure. Auditing standards require such 
matters to be reported as a key audit matter. 
Our response 
Our procedures included:  
 Assessing transparency: Assessing the going concern 
disclosure for clarity, including that there is disclosure of a 
material uncertainty by: 
 reviewing refinancing documentation including level of initial 
consenting investors to corroborate financing situation; and 
 evaluating assumptions used in forecast models, in particular 
those relating to forecast revenue and cash collection; and 
 evaluating track record of assumptions, including forecast 
revenue, versus actual results; and 
 assessing reasonably possible downside scenarios that would 
result in the cash flow falling such that the headroom against 
available facilities reduced to nil. 
3. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement   
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team.  Going concern is a significant key 
audit matter and is described in section 2 above.  We summarise 
below the other key audit matters in arriving at our audit opinion 
above, together with our key audit procedures to address the 
matters. All of the key audit matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.  In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit 
matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows: 
Group: Recoverability of trade receivables and accrued 
income  
Net trade receivables $22.8 million; 2016: $5.5 million 
Accrued income $13.7 million; 2016: $17.2 million 
Refer to page 21 (Audit Committee Report), page 49  
(accounting policy) and page 64 - 65 (financial disclosures). 
The risk - Subjective estimate 
There are significant trade receivables and accrued income 
balances with customers operating in the African and Middle  
East regions. 
These businesses are often operating in immature emerging 
markets for satellite communication services and may have 
cashflow difficulties due to the market and geopolitical environment 
in which they operate.  
   INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF AVANTI COMMUNICATIONS GROUP PLC  
CONTINUED 
32 
Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
Our response 
Our procedures included:  
 Historical comparisons: evaluating the directors’ assumptions 
behind the provision against trade receivables with reference to 
historical track record with the same or similar customers and 
our own knowledge of recent bad debts and cash collection; 
and 
 Tests of details: assessing bad debt provisions against aged 
receivables and accrued income balances analysis and cash 
receipts subsequent to year end; and 
 Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy of the group’s 
disclosures about the level of provision. 
Group: Impairment of space assets (HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2)  
Carrying value of HYLAS 1 $58.1 million; 2016: $130.4 million and 
impairment $53.3 million; 2016: nil 
Carrying value of HYLAS 2 $234.8 million; 2016: $310.9 million and 
impairment $60.8 million; 2016: nil 
Refer to page 21 (Audit Committee Report), page 47 - 48 
(accounting policy) and page 59 - 60 (financial disclosures). 
The risk - Forecast-based valuation 
Given the lack of track record and ongoing challenges around fleet 
utilisation, and falling market prices for Ka band services, there is a 
risk of impairment of certain space assets (HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2 
assets). 
The estimated recoverable amount is subjective due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash 
flows. 
Our response 
Our procedures included:  
 Our experience: evaluating assumptions used, in particular 
those relating to the Group’s forecast revenue growth specific  
to each asset; and 
 Historical comparisons: evaluating track record of assumptions 
used, such as forecast revenue, versus actual results; and 
 Benchmarking assumptions: comparing the group’s 
assumptions to externally derived data in relation to key inputs 
such as cost inflation and discount rates; and 
 Sensitivity analysis: considering reasonably possible changes  
in assumptions including forecast revenue and discount rate 
including,  and their impact on the outcome of the impairment 
assessment; and 
 Assessing transparency: assessing whether the group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected 
the risks inherent in the carrying value of the space assets. 
 
Group: Revenue recognition on multi-element 
arrangements 
Total revenue (excluding Government services contracts)  
$39.8 million; 2016: $66.1 million 
Refer to page 21 (Audit Committee Report), page 44  
(accounting policy) and page 50 and 52 (financial disclosures). 
The risk - Subjective estimate 
The group enters into multi element contracts. There is judgement 
involved in allocating the total consideration under the contract to 
each element of the contract using their relative fair values.  That 
judgement is particularly important when some elements have been 
delivered and revenue recognised at the balance sheet date and 
other elements will only be delivered in future periods. 
Our response 
Our procedures included:  
 Our expertise: Inspecting contracts contributing the highest 
levels of revenue and critically assessing the fair value of 
delivered or undelivered elements, such as future bandwidth  
or free of charge equipment; and 
 Tests of details: Assessing the appropriateness of the Directors’ 
judgements in determining the fair value of each element of the 
selected contracts by reference to standalone selling prices, or 
bandwidth capacity renewal rates; and 
 Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the judgements and estimates made in 
accounting for multi element revenue arrangements. 
 
Group: Revenue recognition on Government services 
contracts 
$16.8 million; 2016: $16.7 million 
Total revenue is $56.6 million; 2016: $82.8 million 
Refer to page 21 (Audit Committee Report), page 44  
(accounting policy) and page 50 and 52 (financial disclosures). 
The risk - Subjective estimate 
The group enters into fixed price contracts with customers. There  
is judgement involved in determining the subjective inputs into the 
stage of completion calculation. 
Our response 
Our procedures included: 
 Historical comparison: evaluating the track record of 
assumptions such as forecast costs to complete versus actual 
performance; and 
 Personnel interviews: corroborating judgments on forecast costs 
to complete through discussions with management including 
project level staff; and 
 Test of details: corroborating percentage of completion to 
customer acceptance by reference to payment received; and  INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

(accounting policy) and page 66 (financial disclosures). 
The risk - Forecast-based valuation 
The group has significant deferred tax assets. There is inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting future taxable profits, which 
determines the extent to which deferred tax assets are or are not 
recognised.  
Our response 
Our procedures included:  
 Our experience: evaluating assumptions used, in particular 
those relating to forecast revenue  and useful economic life of 
the Group’s assets; and 
 Historical comparisons: evaluating track record of assumptions, 
such as forecast revenue versus actual results; and 
 Sensitivity analysis: performing sensitivity analysis on the 
forecast revenue assumption noted above, paying particular 
attention to reasonably possible changes in assumptions that 
could have a material impact on the deferred tax asset recorded 
; and 
 Our tax expertise: use of our own tax specialists to assist us in 
assessing the recoverability of the tax losses against the forecast 
future taxable profits, taking into account the group’s tax 
position, the timing of forecast taxable profits, and our 
knowledge and experience of the application of relevant tax 
legislation; and 
 Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy of the group’s 
disclosures in respect of the nature of the evidence to support 
the deferred tax asset recognised. 
Parent: Recoverability of investments in and receivables 
due from subsidiaries 
Recoverability of investments in subsidiaries $148.7 million; 2016: 
$148.7 million 
Receivables due from subsidiaries $747.1 million; 2016: $998.0 
million; Impairment $400 million; 2016: nil  
Refer to page 21 (Audit Committee Report), page 48 - 49 
(accounting policy) and page 62 and 85 (financial disclosures). 
The risk - Forecast-based valuation 
The carrying amount of the parent company’s investments in and 
receivables due from subsidiaries is significant and at risk of not 
being recoverable due to the ongoing challenges around fleet 
utilisation, and falling market prices for Ka band services. 
The estimated recoverable amount of these balances is subjective 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and 
discounting future cash flows.  
The recoverable amount of these investments is related to and 
determined in a similar way to the recoverable amount of the space 
assets, being discounted cash flows generated by the asset of the 
subsidiary.  
Our response 
Our procedures included: 
 Our experience: evaluating assumptions used, in particular 
those relating to forecast revenue growth specific to each asset; 
and  
 Historical comparisons: evaluating track record of assumptions, 
such as forecast revenue versus actual results; and 
 Benchmarking assumptions: comparing the group’s 
assumptions to externally derived data in relation to key inputs 
such as cost inflation and discount rates; and 
 Sensitivity analysis: considering reasonably possible changes in 
assumptions including forecast revenue and discount rate 
including,  and their impact on the outcome of the impairment 
assessment; and 
 Assessing transparency: assessing whether the group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected 
the risks inherent in the valuation of the parent’s investment in 
and receivables from subsidiaries. 
4. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit   
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at 
$8m, determined with reference to a benchmark of total assets, of 
which it represents 1%. 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole 
was set at $3m, determined with reference to a benchmark of 
company total assets, of which it represents 2%.  
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding $0.4m, in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.  
Of the group’s 16 reporting components, we subjected six to full 
scope audits for group purposes.  
The components within the scope of our work accounted for 95% of 
total group revenue, 94% of group loss before tax and 97% of total 
group assets. 
The remaining 5% of total group revenue, 6% of group loss before 
tax and 3% of total group assets is represented by 10 reporting 
components, none of which individually represented more than 4% 
of any of total group revenue, group loss before tax or total group 
assets. For these residual components, we performed analysis at 
an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.  
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above  INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF AVANTI COMMUNICATIONS GROUP PLC  
CONTINUED

Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
and the information to be reported back.  The Group team 
approved the component materialities, which ranged from $0.3m to 
$6.7m, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components.  The work on all components was 
performed by the Group team, including the audit of the parent 
company. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other information 
in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other information presented in 
the Annual Report together with the financial statements.  Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion 
or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.   
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the 
information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our audit knowledge.  Based solely on that 
work we have not identified material misstatements in the other 
information.   
Strategic report and directors’ report   
Based solely on our work on the other information:   
 we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report;   
 in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and   
 in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.   
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on 
which we are required to report by exception   
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:   
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or   
 the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or   
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or   
 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.   
We have nothing to report in these respects.   
7. Respective responsibilities   
Directors’ responsibilities   
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 30, the 
directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.   
Auditor’s responsibilities   
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our 
opinion in an auditor’s report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.   
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.   
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities   
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
1. General information  
The consolidated financial statements of Avanti Communications Group plc (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 30 June 2017 were authorised for 
issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 December 2017.  
Avanti Communications Group plc (the ‘Company’ or together with its subsidiaries, the ‘Group’) is a company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom and domiciled in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is Cobham House, 20 Black Friars Lane, London, EC4V 
6EB. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 2.  
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’) and trades under the ticker ‘AVN.L’ on 
the London Stock Exchange.  
2. Principal accounting policies  
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.  
Basis of preparation  
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(‘IFRS’), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee Interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
preparing their accounts under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain 
financial instruments that have been measured at fair value, as described later in these accounting policies.  
The Company has taken the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 to not present the parent Company Income Statement or 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.  
Going concern  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In reaching their assessment, the Directors have considered a period 
extending at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. This assessment has focused on the status of the financial 
restructuring announced by the Group on 13 December as well as those factors considered on an annual basis such as forecast trading 
performance of the Group for the foreseeable future, key assumptions, sensitivities and available cash balances and facilities. As at the date of 
approval of these financial statements, the successful completion of the financial restructuring is conditional upon the Consent Solicitation and 
Scheme of Arrangement processes described further below and while the Directors believe that these processes will be completed 
successfully, there remains a material uncertainty until the remaining consents and approvals have been received.  
As described in Note 23, the Group has the following debt instruments, excluding finance leases, as at the date of approval of the financial 
statements:  
Instrument   Nominal Value  Lien  Due  
Super Senior Facility  $118.0m*  1st lien  21 June 2020 
PIK Toggle Notes   $323.0m   2nd lien  1 October 2021 
Amended Existing Notes  $557.0m   3rd lien  1 October 2022 
* $118m was drawn down from the super senior facility post year-end. 
The financial restructuring announced on 13 December comprised the following components which are described in further detail below: 
1. Debt for equity Swap - Exchange of all of the Amended Existing Notes for ordinary share capital of the Company  
2. Amendment to the economic terms of the PIK Toggle Notes       
The restructuring, which is described in Note 32, culminated on 13 December 2017 when a Lock-Up & Restructuring Agreement was signed by 
the Company with a group of its largest holders of PIK Toggle Notes, Amended Existing Notes and ordinary share capital (‘Initial Consenting 
Investors’). The Company and the Initial Consenting Investors, representing approximately: 
 62% of the aggregate principal amount of the existing PIK Toggle Notes  
 55% of the aggregate principal amount of the existing Amended Existing Notes and 
 34% of the ordinary share capital

2. Principal Accounting Policies continued  
Going concern continued 
The Group entered into the Restructuring Agreement on 13 December 2017 pursuant to which the Initial Consenting Investors contractually 
agreed to: 
 approve the Amended Existing Notes restructuring by voting in favour of the Scheme, tendering their Amended Existing Notes in the 
exchange offer and voting in favour of the related shareholder resolutions; 
 approve the PIK Toggle Notes restructuring by delivering Consents in connection with the Solicitation, or approvals in connect with the 
scheme of arrangement. 
1. Repayment of the Amended Existing Notes 
The exchange of all of the Amended Existing Notes for 92.5% of Avanti’s enlarged outstanding share capital. This debt for equity swap will 
involve the settlement of the 3rd lien debt with a nominal value of $557.0m and accrued interest of approximately $22.4m through the issue of 
approximately 2.0 billion ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company. The holders of the current Amended Existing Notes will hold 92.5% of the 
Company’s enlarged share capital following completion of this restructuring.  
The debt for equity swap approval will be sought under an English law scheme of arrangement (the ‘Scheme’) which requires approval from 
75% of the holders of the Amended Existing Notes.  
The Scheme of Arrangement will commence in early January 2018 and the process will last for approximately 6-8 weeks. This process will 
result in one of the two following outcomes:  
1. Receipt of consents from note holders equating to at least 75% of the Existing Notes by number and value. This will result in the terms of 
the restructuring being approved and applied to 100% of the Amended Existing Notes. The Initial Consenting Investors are contractually 
committed to providing their consents and equate to 55% of the Existing Notes.  
2. Consents will be received amounting to less than 75% of the Existing Noteholders. This is considered unlikely given that the Initial 
Consenting Investors are contractually committed to providing their consents and equate to 55% of the Existing Notes. In this scenario,  
the restructuring would fail and the Group would need to successfully complete an alternative restructuring or raise new money in order  
to have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  
2. Amendment to economic terms of the 2021 Notes 
The amendment to the terms of the 2
nd
 lien as follows: 
 extend the final maturity date from October 1, 2021 to October 1, 2022; 
 change the interest rate payable on the 2021 Notes from 10% Cash / 15% PIK to 9% Cash / 9% PIK for all remaining interest periods 
commencing October 1, 2017; 
 eliminate the step up in interest payable on the 2021 Notes if the relevant minimum consolidated LTM EBITDA threshold is not met; 
 eliminate the Maintenance of Minimum Consolidated LTM EBITDA covenant contained in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes; 
 require interest payments on the 2021 Notes for all remaining interest periods commencing October 1, 2017 (but excluding the final interest 
payment) to be made in cash so long as Avanti has sufficient cash, pro forma, to satisfy the applicable interest coupon, the next cash 
interest payment due on the Super Senior Debt and any necessary working capital requirements (i.e. ‘Pay If You Can’ Interest). 
The amendment to the economic terms of the PIK Toggle Notes will be sought under a Consent Solicitation process. Under the terms of the PIK 
Toggle Notes Indenture, consent to the changes is required from holders of 90% of the PIK Toggle Notes. Should approval not be received 
from 90% or more of the PIK Toggle Note holders, an English law scheme of arrangement will be prepared which requires approval from 75% 
of the holders of the PIK Toggle Notes.  
The Consent Solicitation will commence in early January 2018 and will last for a maximum of 10 business days. This process will result in one of 
the following outcomes:  
1. Receipt of consents from note holders equating to at least 90% of the 2021 Notes by number and value. This will result in the terms of the 
restructuring being approved and applied to 100% of the 2021 Notes. The Initial Consenting Investors are contractually committed to 
providing their consents and equate to 62% of the Existing Notes.  
2. Receipt of consents will be received amounting to less than 90% of the Existing Noteholders. In this scenario, an English law scheme of 
arrangement would commence, seeking approval via an alternative mechanism for the amendment to the economic terms of the PIK 
Toggle Notes. The Scheme of Arrangement would run for approximately 6-8 weeks and would result in one of the two following outcomes:

4. Consents will be received amounting to less than 75% of the Existing Noteholders. This is considered unlikely given that the Initial

the restructuring would fail and the Group would need to successfully complete an alternative restructuring or raise new money in order  
to have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
In addition to the consents required from the holders of the Amended Existing Notes to have their notes converted into ordinary share capital, 
the holders of the Company’s ordinary share capital pre-reorganisation also need to approve three shareholder resolutions in order for the debt 
for equity swap to be successfully completed: 
1. An ordinary resolution to approve the issue of approximately 2.0 billion new ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company. This resolution 
requires greater than 50% of votes cast to be passed. 
2. A special resolution to disapply pre-emption rights with respect to the issue of these shares. This resolution requires greater than 75% of 
votes cast to be passed. 
3. A resolution for the waiver of rights of independent shareholders to receive a mandatory takeover offer from one of the Initial Consenting 
Investors who will hold in excess of 30% of the ordinary share capital of the Company following the proposed restructuring. This resolution 
requires greater than 50% of votes cast by independent shareholders to be passed.  
Should any of these shareholder resolutions not be passed, the restructuring of the Amended Existing Notes would fail and the Group would 
need to successfully complete an alternative restructuring or raise new money in order to have sufficient resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The Initial Consenting Investors hold 34% of the ordinary share capital in the Company and are committed 
to voting in favour of these resolutions.  
Additional fund raise  
Following and contingent upon completion of the restructuring, an additional fund raising will be completed in the form of equity, new PIK 
Toggle Notes or a combination of both instruments.  The minimum value is likely to be $30.0m but may be adjusted dependent on demand.  
The directors of the Company have received assurances from members of the Initial Consenting Investors that they will participate in the 
additional fund raising.  Should this additional fund raising not be completed successfully, the Group would need to raise cash through another 
route such as an alternative fund raising or asset sale in order to have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. 
Following the signing of the Lock-Up & Restructuring Agreement, which is the platform for a successful financial restructuring, and in order to 
prepare and approve these Financial Statements, the Directors have assessed forecast future cash flows for the foreseeable future, being a 
period of at least a year following the approval of the accounts. In assessing the Group’s ability to meet its obligation as they fall due, 
management prepared cash flow forecasts based on the business plan for a period of 12 months.  Management considered various downside 
scenarios to test the Group’s resilience against operational risk including: 
 Slower build in fleet/satellite utilisation 
 Planned revenue from exploitation of spectrum rights and satellite interim missions doesn’t materialise 
However, were those downside scenarios to materialise, Management would take mitigating actions, notably the ability to PIK interest payable 
in October 2018 on the 2021 Notes. Management therefore concluded that the Group’s Capital Structure after the planned financial 
restructuring comprising of the debt for equity swap, and amendment to the economic terms of the PIK Toggle Notes, together with the planned 
additional fund raise and the substantial achievement of cash flow forecasts, provides sufficient headroom to cushion against downside 
operational risks.

In summary, the Directors have concluded that, based on the group’s expectation that the Consent Solicitation for a financial restructure will be 
successful, together with the planned additional fund raise and substantial achievement of cash flow forecasts, the Directors believe that the 
Group will be able to have sufficient liquidity and will be able to meet its obligations as they fall due.  The Directors have accordingly formed the 
judgement that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.  There can, however, be no certainty that the 
required consents will be received or that the refinancing will be successfully completed.  Accordingly, successful completion of the 
refinancing, planned fund raise and the substantial achievement of cash flow forecasts represent a material uncertainty that may cast 
significant doubt on the group and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The group and the parent company may, 
therefore, be unable to continue realising their assets and discharging their liabilities in the normal course of business, but the financial 
statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the going concern basis of preparation is inappropriate. 
Basis of accounting  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, the functional currency of the Company and most of the Group’s 
subsidiaries. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet 
date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best estimate 
of the amount, event or actions, the actual results ultimately may differ from these estimates. Further discussion on these estimates and 
assumptions are disclosed in Note 3.  
Accounting Policy Changes  
New and amended accounting standards adopted by the Group  
There are no new IFRS or IFRIC Interpretations that are effective for this financial year that have had a material impact on the Group.  
New and amended accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet effective and have not been early adopted  
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ was issued in May 2014 and subsequent amendments, ‘Clarifications to IFRS15’, were issued 
in April 2016. IFRS 15, as amended, and will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard sets out the 
requirements for recognising revenue from contracts with customers, and will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and the related interpretations. IFRS 15 will require the Group to apportion revenue earned 
from contracts to each deliverable that qualifies as a ‘performance obligation’. The transaction price receivable from customers must be 
allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, based on a five-step model. The Group is currently 
assessing the impact of this standard on the financial statements.  
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued in January 2016 and will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to endorsement by 
the EU. The standard sets out requirements for recognising assets and liabilities in respect of leases, and will supersede the existing 
accounting guidance in IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and the related interpretations. IFRS 16 will require the Group, where it is the lessee, to recognise 
assets and liabilities for most leases, however there is little change to IAS 17 where the Group is the lessor. The Group is currently assessing 
the impact of this standard on the financial statements.  
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was issued in July 2014 and will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard will 
impact the classification and measurement of financial instruments and will supersede IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’. While the Group has not finalised its assessment of this standard, it does not expect the changes to have a material impact on 
the financial statements. There are no other IFRS or IFRIC Interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material 
impact on the Group.  
Basis of consolidation  
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its controlled undertakings (‘subsidiaries’), after 
the elimination of all material inter-company transactions. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Company obtains control until such 
time as control ceases. Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. Adjustments are made to bring 
into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist. For details regarding the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial 
statements see Note (17).  
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries which consist of the amounts of those interests at the date of the original 
business combination and the non-controlling interests’ share of changes in equity since the date of the combination, are not material to the 
Group’s financial statements.

Business Combinations  
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. When the Group acquires a business, it identifies the assets and 
liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition and measures them at fair value. Only separately identifiable intangible assets are 
recognised.  
Consideration is the fair value at the acquisition date of the assets transferred and liabilities incurred in acquiring the business. Acquisition-
related costs are expensed as incurred and included in operating costs.  
Goodwill is initially measured at cost as the difference between the fair value of the consideration for the acquisition and fair value of the net 
identifiable assets acquired, including any intangible assets other than goodwill. If the assessment of goodwill results in an excess of the fair 
value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in the income statement. After initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the business combination, irrespective of whether other 
assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.  
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.  
Revenue recognition  
Business Model  
The Group’s business model is the commercial exploitation of its space assets, namely its spectrum rights, satellites intellectual property and 
ground station assets. The Group generates its revenues from the commercialisation of these assets either directly or through the Group’s 
extensive partner base using product categories and charging models to suit customer and market circumstances.  
The Group generates its revenues primarily from:  
 Capacity - Sale of satellite broadband packages and capacity to customers 
 Spectrum - Sale and leasing of spectrum rights 
 Services - Sale of services in addition to satellite broadband capacity, typically to Government customers 
 Equipment - Sale of terminals and other satellite communications equipment 
 Exclusivity rights – Sale of exclusivity rights across a region or product type 
Additional product categories and charging models which generate revenue include, and are not limited to, satellite interim missions, the sale 
of exclusive distribution rights, consultancy projects, engineering services, satellite control services and ground station operation services.  
Capacity, services and equipment 
Revenue for satellite broadband communications services is recognised for Avanti’s three main products as follows:  
 Pure – raw bandwidth – customers have exclusive use of a defined number of MHz in specific beams. The proportion of the total contract 
value recognised as revenue in a period equates to the proportion of the total contracted capacity provided in that period. 
 Custom – managed IP service – customers have exclusive use of a defined number of Mb in specific beams. The proportion of thetotal 
contract value recognised as revenue in a period equates to the proportion of the total contracted capacity provided in that period. 
 Select – packaged broadband – customers buy individual broadband user accounts, which are managed and defined by Avanti. Revenues 
are recognised in the period in which the service is delivered based on the number of user accounts and contracted prices per account. 
Capacity revenue includes the sale of transponders in addition to the sale of indefeasible rights of use where the revenue recognition criteria 
are met.  
Revenue from services sold as a fully integrated package with satellite capacity, consultancy and other services contracts connected with the 
utilisation of the Group’s space assets are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the reporting date. The 
contracts are broken down into separable elements which are all judged individually on a percentage of completion basis in order to ascertain 
the completeness of an overall project. By their nature, these projects require a certain element of judgement by management. Contract costs 
are recognised as an expense in the period they are incurred. Where Avanti is judged to be the prime partner, revenues are recognised on a 
gross basis in line with the risks and rewards of the contract.  
Revenue from the sale of terminals and other satellite communication equipment is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have 
transferred to the customer.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue recognition continued 
Spectrum co-ordination 
Revenue from spectrum co-ordination agreements is typically recognised on a straight-line basis over the period where spectrum is leased and 
immediately where the Group sells spectrum assets in perpetuity.  
Exclusivity rights  
Revenue from the sale of exclusive distribution rights across a region or product type for a fixed term are recognised over the period of the 
agreement. Revenue from the sale of exclusive distribution rights in perpetuity are recognised immediately where the revenue recognition 
criteria are met. Specifically that the sale is for a fixed, non-refundable fee under a non-cancellable agreement and there is no significant further 
managerial involvement required. 
Policies applicable to all revenue streams 
The Group offers certain products and services as part of multi-deliverable arrangements. Multi-deliverable arrangements are divided into 
separate units of accounting provided: 1) the deliverable has a stand-alone value to the customer if it is sold separately, and 2) the fair value of 
the item can be objectively and reliably determined. Consideration for these items is measured and allocated to each separate unit based on its 
relative fair value and the relevant revenue recognition policy is applied to it.  
Where goods or services are provided in exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or 
services received where these can be reliably measured, otherwise at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount 
of cash or cash equivalents received.  
The Group discloses the amount of each significant category of revenue recognised during the year in a note to the Financial Statements. The 
Group presents revenue from a given transaction or revenue stream separately on the face of the Income Statement when such presentation is 
relevant to an understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Factors including the nature and function of items of revenue are considered 
in determining the appropriate presentation.  
Accrued income represents the excess of revenue recognised over amounts invoiced. Deferred income represents any unearned balances 
remaining from amounts received from customers pursuant to prepaid contracts.  
Indefeasible rights of use  
Where the Group enters into an arrangement which constitutes an indefeasible right of use (‘IRU’), the arrangement is reviewed to establish 
whether the IRU is a lease, a service contract or a sale of goods. Whether an arrangement contains a lease is assessed by considering whether 
the provision of a service depends on the use of one or more specific assets and whether the agreement conveys a right to use those assets.  
Once it has been determined that an IRU is, or contains, a lease, the arrangement is accounted for in accordance with the leased assets 
accounting policy.  
Leased assets  
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an 
assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement 
conveys the right to use the asset.  
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group holds substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Assets acquired under hire purchase or a finance lease are capitalised in the Statement of Financial Position. Those held under hire 
purchase and finance lease contracts are depreciated over the shorter of either their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease. The interest 
element of these obligations is charged to the Income Statement over the relevant period. The capital element of the future payments is treated 
as a liability.  
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards are held by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rentals are charged to the 
Income Statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.  
Interest income and expense  
Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of the satellite assets are capitalised during the period of time required to complete and prepare 
the assets for their intended use, in accordance with IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the Income Statement.  
Interest income on cash deposits is recognised on an effective interest rate methodology, taking into account the principal amounts 
outstanding and the interest rates applicable.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Foreign currency  
Transactions entered into by the Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(the ‘functional currency’) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities 
are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.  
The presentational currency of the Group is US Dollars.  
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into US Dollars at year end exchange rates. The results of foreign 
undertakings are translated into US Dollars at average rates of exchange for the year (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of 
the cumulative effects of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the 
transactions).  
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the foreign currency 
translation reserve.  
In the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation difference 
associated with the undertaking in the translation reserve is charged or credited to the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Income 
Statement.  
Pension schemes  
Employees have the option to participate in the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme or to establish their own pension scheme to 
which the Group will match employee contributions up to a maximum amount. There is no ongoing liability to the Group beyond the period that 
the contributions are made. The costs of such contributions are charged to the Income Statement when incurred.  
Share based payments  
The Group operates a number of equity settled share based payment arrangements, under which the Group receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments (share options and shares) of the Group. Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair 
value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant, but include any market based performance criteria and 
the impact of vesting conditions. The fair value determined at the grant date is recognised on a straight line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of the options or shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting 
conditions  
Fair value is measured using either the Binomial options pricing model, the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo simulations, whichever is most 
appropriate to the award.  
Service and performance conditions are vesting conditions. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions which have to be taken into 
account to determine the fair value of equity instruments granted. In the case that an award or option does not vest as a result of a failure to 
meet a non-vesting condition that is within the control of either counterparty, this is accounted for as a cancellation. Cancellations must be 
treated as accelerated vesting and all remaining future charges are immediately recognised. As the requirement to save under an employee 
share save arrangement is a non-vesting condition, employee cancellations must be treated as an accelerated vesting.  
Current tax  
The charge for taxation is based on taxable profits for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the Income Statement because it 
excludes items of income and expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible.  
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity respectively.  
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities based on tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax  
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised.  
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the 
asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. The measurement of the deferred tax 
liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to 
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable Group company or different 
Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liability 
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.  
Property, plant and equipment  
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
provided so as to write off the cost of assets, other than assets under construction, over their estimated useful lives using the straight line 
method. Depreciation on satellite assets commences once in-orbit testing has been completed and the satellite is available for use.  
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method based on the following useful lives:  
Motor vehicles 25% per annum    Plant and machinery 25% per annum  
Network assets 20–25% per annum   Leasehold improvements 25% per annum  
Fixtures and fittings 25% per annum    Satellite in construction Nil  
Satellite in operation 6.67% per annum  
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis. The gain or loss arising on the disposal of assets is charged to the Income Statement account and is 
calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets.  
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the 
term of the relevant lease. 
Satellites in construction assets relate to costs (including employee-related costs) directly attributable to the construction of the HYLAS 
satellites. Once the satellites become operational and placed into service, the assets are transferred to a space asset category and 
depreciated over the life of the satellites.  
Where the conditions are not met, the costs are expensed through the Income Statement.

Intangible assets  
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is provided so  
as to write off the cost of assets, other than assets under construction, over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method.  
The amortisation rate on computer software is 25%. Newly acquired intangible assets as part of the business combination, customer lists  
and trade name are amortised over 15 and 5 years respectively.  
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
 intended use.  
The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortisation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis. The gain or loss arising on the disposal of assets is charged to the Income Statement and is calculated 
as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets.  
Research and development costs in relation to the satellites are capitalised if they meet the conditions set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ 
which are that development costs are only capitalised once a business case has been demonstrated as to the technical feasibility and 
commercial viability. Capitalised development costs are amortised over the expected useful life of the assets.  
Impairment of non-financial assets  
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use, are not subject to amortisation and will be 
tested annually for impairment.  
Impairment of non-financial assets continued 
Assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the fixed asset with 
its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  
Fair value less costs to sell is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could be disposed of. Value in use is calculated by 
discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the asset’s continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate 
disposal, at a market based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.  
An impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.  
The carrying amount will only be increased where an impairment loss recognised in a previous period for an asset either no longer exists or has 
decreased, up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.  
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, CGUs are identified as groups of assets and liabilities that generate cash flows that are 
largely independent of other cash flow streams. The assets and liabilities include those directly involved in generating the cash flows and an 
appropriate proportion of corporate assets. For the purposes of impairment, individual satellites are treated as individual CGUs.  
For the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, goodwill is allocated to a group of CGUs (being subsidiaries acquired in each acquisition). 
Such group of CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group for which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.  
Investments  
Investments are recorded at cost. Investments are reviewed for indicators of impairment on an annual basis when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.  
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment, and reviewed for indicators of impairment on an annual basis.  
If such indicators exist and an impairment review is required, the impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the 
investment with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  
Fair value less costs to sell is calculated by reference to the amount at which the investment could be disposed of. Value in use is calculated by 
discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the investment’s continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate 
disposal, at a market based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.  
An impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement whenever the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount.

Grant funding  
Other grant income which has capital expenditure and job creation/safeguarding targets is recognised on a straight line basis over the relevant 
period irrespective of cash and claims, and is disclosed as other operating income.  
Inventories  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs 
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.  
Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method.  
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.

Trade and loan receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method where the time value of money is material. Appropriate allowances for estimating irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in the Income Statement where there is evidence that the asset is impaired. This impairment would be recognised within cost of 
sales.  
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised as an expense when there is objective evidence that trade 
receivables are impaired.  
Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position are comprised of cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. For 
the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents are stated net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  
Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefits arising from past events and the 
amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are not recognised unless the outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation 
is more likely than not to occur.  
Borrowings  
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.  
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the reporting date.  
Where a substantial modification to the terms of existing debt has taken place, the original debt is de-recognised and ‘new’ debt recoreded at 
market value at the date of modification. The difference is taken to the income statement. 
Trade payables  
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

2. Principal Accounting Policies continued  
Derivative financial instruments  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments mainly to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks. The Group does not hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. Fair value is measured using the closing bank rate compared with the contract rate.  
Hedge accounting is currently not applied. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Income Statement as 
they arise.  
Segment reporting  
Operating segment(s) are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief 
operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segment(s), has been 
identified as the Avanti Executive Board who make the strategic decisions. 
3. Critical accounting estimates and management judgement 
The presentation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year are addressed below. 
(a) Revenue recognition 
The Group uses the percentage of completion method in accounting for its Government services projects. Use of the percentage of completion 
method requires the Group to estimate the services performed to date as a proportion of the total services to be performed. The Group 
assesses the level of completion at the balance sheet date by reference to a combination of time or cost incurred to date compared to the 
forecast total required to deliver each service and project. 
Should the service completion take substantially more or less time to complete post year-end, the revenue recognised in the current and future 
financial period would in hindsight be misstated.  
The group also enters into multi-element contracts where there is judgement involved in determining the relative fair value of the delivered and 
undelivered elements on the contract. The Group assess relative fair value by reference to standalone selling prices, and bandwidth capacity 
renewal rates. 
(b) Trade receivables and accrued income  
The Group has trade receivables and accrued income, net of provisions, totalling $42.9m at the balance sheet date. The directors have 
assessed the recoverability of each balance, including those where contractually agreed deferred payment terms are in place, in reaching the 
year end position. 
Should a material unprovided trade receivable or accrued income amount not be recovered, a material adjustment to the trade receivable 
balance and bad debt expense would arise in a future financial period. 
The Group has provided for amounts due from the Government of Indonesia totalling $16.8m at the financial year end. Avanti contracted with 
the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to provide services on its Artemis satellite and performed all of its obligations under that contract. After an 
extended period of time in which payment of the outstanding invoices had not been received, the Group terminated the contract and initiated 
arbitration proceedings in London. The outstanding amount is $16.8m and has been fully provided for in these accounts. GoI has not disputed 
that the amounts are due and payable. Avanti is confident that the arbitration panel will rule in the Group’s favour and has provided for the debt 
at the year end until the uncertainty related to enforcing the arbitration panel’s expected ruling has been sufficiently reduced or eliminated. 
Should the Group be successful in attempts to collect the outstanding amounts, a material adjustment to the bad debt provision and expense 
will be required in a future financial period. 
Further disclosure can be found in Note18.

3. Critical accounting estimates and management judgement continued 
(c) HYLAS 1 satellite impairment review 
The Group has recognised an impairment charge against the carrying amount of HYLAS 1 of $53.3m in the current financial year. As is more 
fully disclosed in Note 13, the impairment charge is an estimate that is based on the Group’s discounted cash flow forecast for the HYLAS 1 
asset. Should the yield, capacity ramp-up, satellite life and factors behind the discount rate in future financial periods materially diverge from 
the assumptions made in this assessment, the impairment recognised in the current financial year may be materially in excess of what was 
required or a further impairment charge may be required in a future financial period. 
(d) HYLAS 2 satellite impairment review 
The Group has recognised an impairment charge against the carrying amount of HYLAS 1 of $60.8m in the current financial year. As is more 
fully disclosed in Note 13, the impairment charge is an estimate that is based on the Group’s discounted cash flow forecast for the HYLAS 2 
asset. Should the yield, capacity ramp-up, satellite life and factors behind the discount rate in future financial periods materially diverge from 
the assumptions made in this assessment, the impairment recognised in the current financial year may be materially in excess of what was 
required or a further impairment charge may be required in a future financial period.     
(e) Filiago goodwill impairment review 
The Group has recognised an impairment charge against the carrying amount of the Filiago goodwill of $9.9m in the current financial year. As is 
more fully disclosed in Note 14, the impairment charge is an estimate that is based on the Group’s discounted cash flow forecast for the Filiago 
cash generating unit. Should the revenue and operating margins generated by the Filiago business in future financial periods materially diverge 
from the assumptions made in this assessment, the impairment recognised in the current financial year may be materially in excess of what was 
required. The maximum additional impairment charge that may be required in a future financial period is immaterial at $1.6m. 
(f) Deferred tax 
Significant items on which the Group has exercised accounting judgement include recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses and 
accelerated capital allowances in the United Kingdom. 
The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether management judge that it is more likely than 
not that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.  
Judgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits.  In assessing the level of future taxable profits reference is made to 
the latest available profit forecasts. Changes in the estimates which underpin those profit forecasts could have an impact on the amount of 
future taxable profits and could have a significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax assets would be recovered and 
consequently the extent to which they should be recognised.  
The nature of the evidence supporting the recognition of the deferred tax assets included contracted revenue that will be recognised in future 
periods, revenue from new business signed in FY18, forecast revenue in future periods from opportunities in the pipeline (including modest 
expectations in relation to future capacity sales on HYLAS 4) and taxable temporary differences of an appropriate type that reverse in an 
appropriate period. 
(g) Recoverability of parent company investments in and receivables from subsidiary undertakings 
The Company has recognised a provision against the carrying amount of receivables from group entities of $400.0m in the current  
financial year.  
The estimated recoverable amount of these balances is an estimate determined in a similar way to the recoverable amount of the space  
assets, being discounted discounted value of the assets of the subsidiary. Should the yield, capacity ramp-up, satellite life and factors 
behind the discount rate in future financial periods materially diverge from the assumptions made in this assessment, the impairment 
recognised in the current financial year may be materially in excess of what was required or a further impairment charge may be required  
in a future financial period.

4. Revenue 
As stated in Note 2, the Group generates its revenues from the utilisation of its space assets, namely its spectrum rights and satellites. These 
revenues include the sale of satellite broadband services, the sale and leasing of spectrum rights, the sale of services, typically to Government 
customers, and the sale of terminals and other satellite communications equipment. 
The Avanti Executive Board, which is the chief operating decision-maker in the Group’s corporate governance structure, manages the business 
and the allocation of resources on the basis of the utilisation of its space assets, resulting in one segment. 
Revenue generated for the year was as follows: 
 
30 June  
2017 
$'m 
30 June  
2016 
$'m 
Capacity, services and equipment revenue 56.6 74.5 
Exclusivity rights – 8.3 
   
Total revenue 56.6 82.8 
The majority of total revenue for the year represents the sale of satellite broadband capacity and related services provided to external 
customers and the sale of terminals and other satellite communications equipment. Of this, $5.3m (2016: $13.2m) relates to the sale of 
terminals and other satellite communications equipment. 
The Group derived $11.1m (2016: $19.9m) of its turnover from European countries outside the United Kingdom, $25.3m (2016: $39.7m) from 
countries outside Europe and $20.2m (2016: $23.2m) from the United Kingdom. 
Sale of exclusivity rights 
$8.3m was recognised during the prior financial year from the sale of exclusivity rights.  
During the year ended 30 June 2016, the Group entered into an agreement with Eurona Wireless Telekom SA (‘Eurona’), a Spanish based 
Internet service provider, under which Eurona were sold the exclusive rights in perpetuity to the provision of services to the consumer 
broadband market in Spain and Portugal (‘Iberia’) from any existing or future Avanti satellite. 
Eurona are required to pay a fixed, non-refundable fee of €7.5m under a non-cancellable agreement in consideration for the rights. As a result, 
Eurona have sole rights to sell capacity directed over Iberia on any Avanti satellite for use in delivering service to the consumer broadband 
market. The exclusivity right does not convey or include any satellite capacity, which must be purchased separately.  
At the same time, Eurona entered into an agreement to purchase substantial initial capacity over Iberia with a value of €17.2m over a 10 year 
period. The provision of capacity commenced in the 2017 financial year and revenue has been recognised within the sale of capacity, services 
and equipment. The sale of €2.5m of satellite communications equipment was recognised during the prior financial year and a further €1.5m 
was recognised in the current year under a modification to the original agreement. 
The agreement with Eurona was assessed under the Group’s accounting policy for multi-deliverable arrangements. An assessment was made 
as to whether the sale of exclusivity rights, capacity and equipment represented separate units of account. This assessment concluded that 
each component was separable on the basis that each deliverable has stand-alone value to Eurona and the fair-value of the item can be 
objectively and reliably determined.  
The fair value of the undelivered components (residual value method) was used to assess the fair value of the exclusivity rights and equipment 
recorded in the prior year, and the equipment recorded in the current year. This assessment led to the conclusion that there was no material 
difference between the contractual value of $8.3m (€7.5m) and the fair value of the exclusivity components, and of the contractual value and 
fair value of the equipment components.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK fell from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017. Accordingly, the Group's profits for this 
accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 19.75% (2016: 20.0%). 
The income tax credit of $12.0m (2016: $2.2m charge) equates to an effective tax rate of 15% (2015: (3%)). This effective rate is lower than the 
effective rate of tax of 19.75% due to a number of items shown above. The rate is primarily driven by the Group recognising a credit in respect 
of tax losses arising in prior years as a result of forecast profit streams (in particular related to HYLAS 4) against which these losses can be 
offset, and expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

10. Income tax charge continued 
Factors that may affect future tax charges  
Changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020 were substantially enacted on  
15 September 2016. The deferred tax balance as at the year end has been recognised at 17% (2016: 18%) which materially reflects  
the rate for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. 
Tax losses  
At the balance sheet date the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of $29.5m (2016: $37.2m) available for offset against future profits. 
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $64.3m (2016: $28.0m). No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the 
remaining losses and other temporary differences on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.  
Under present tax legislation, these losses and other temporary differences may be carried forward indefinitely. In the future if these assets are 
recognised there will be a positive impact to the Group's effective tax rate. Conversely, if revenues generated by HYLAS 4 fall materially short  
of expectations there will be a negative impact to the Group’s effective tax rate. 
In the UK, with effect from 1 April 2017, only 50% of profits above $5m may be offset by losses brought forwards. This will slow the rate at which 
the deferred tax asset on losses can be utilised, and hence will result in the Group paying cash tax in the UK earlier than would otherwise be 
the case.

HYLAS 1 satellite impairment review  
HYLAS 1 is a 3 Ghz Ka-band High Throughput Satellite that came into operational service on 1 April 2011. Each year the Group consider the 
carrying value of its assets and looks for indications of impairment. An impairment review was conducted for the HYLAS 1 satellite and 
associated network infrastructure (‘HYLAS 1’), at 30 June 2017 as a result of growth in revenues being slower than forecast. 
With falling market prices for Ka-band services reducing the ability of future cash generation to make-up for the slower than expected revenue 
generation in the earlier years of HYLAS 1, the review showed that an impairment of $53.3m was required to bring the the carrying value of 
HYLAS 1 to $58.1m. 
The recoverable amount of HYLAS 1 was determined using value-in-use, which is calculated by using the discounted cash flow method. This 
method considers the forecast cash flows of the HYLAS 1 satellite and associated network infrastructure over the remaining useful economic 
life of the asset of approximately 9.5 years. 
Estimates of future cash flows originate from the detailed budget for the year to 30 June 2018 as reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Forecasts for the subsequent periods are driven by the following key assumptions: 
1. Capacity ramp - The discounted cash flow forecast assumes a ramp up in capacity utilisation of 8% per year to full utilisation at the end of 
FY24, from a combination of contractual ramps, development of existing customer relationships and new business development 
2. Yield - price per unit of capacity - The discounted cash flow forecast makes assumptions about the price per unit of capacity which is 
driven by both market conditions and the efficiency of data throughput which varies due to a number of factors such as customer type and 
hardware platform 
3. Satellite life - The discounted cash flow forecast is prepared over the estimated remaining useful economic life of the asset 
4. Discount rate - The present value of the cash flows is calculated by using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.4% derived using the Group’s 
incremental cost of borrowing 
Sensitivity analysis was carried out by management over the assumptions made in the impairment model relating to yield, growth in utilisation 
and the discount factor applied. This sensitivity analysis was performed as a part of the impairment exercise in order to provide insight into the 
sensitivity of the impairment charge to changes in these key assumptions. 
 a 10% decrease in the forecast yield on the uncontracted capacity over the life of the cash flow forecast would increase the impairment 
charge by $3.7m.  A 10% increase in the forecast yield would have an equivalent impact in decreasing the impairment charge.      
 a scenario in which the ramp-up of the currently unutilised capacity occurs at 80% of the forecast growth would increase the impairment 
charge by $7.4m.   
 a 1% increase in discount factor applied would increase the impairment charge by $2.7m  
The position adopted in the HYLAS 1 impairment review represent management’s best estimate of the forecasts and assumptions. 
HYLAS 2 satellite impairment review  
HYLAS 2 is an 11 Ghz Ka-band High Throughput Satellite that came into operational service on 1 October 2012. Each year the Group 
considers the carrying value of its assets and looks for indications of impairment. An impairment review was conducted for the HYLAS 2 
satellite and associated network infrastructure (‘HYLAS 2’), at 30 June 2017 as a result of growth in revenues being slower than forecast. 
With falling market prices for Ka-band services reducing the ability of future cash generation to make-up for the slower than expected revenue 
generation in the earlier years of HYLAS 2, the review showed that an impairment of $60.8m was required to bring the carrying value of HYLAS 
2 to $234.8m. 
The recoverable amount of HYLAS 2 was determined using value-in-use, which is calculated by using the discounted cash flow method.      
This method considers the forecast cash flows of the HYLAS 2 satellite and associated network infrastructure over the remaining useful 
economic life of the asset of approximately 10.5 years. 
Estimates of future cash flows originate from the detailed budget for the year to 30 June 2018 as reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Forecasts for the subsequent periods are driven by the following key assumptions: 
1. Capacity sold - The discounted cash flow forecast assumes a ramp up in capacity utilisation of 12% per year to the end of FY23, with 
modest incremental growth thereafter, from a combination of contractual ramps, development of existing customer relationships and new 
business development  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 a scenario in which the ramp-up of the currently unutilised capacity occurs at 80% of the forecast growth would increase the  impairment 
charge by $38.5m. 
 a 1% increase in discount factor applied would increase the impairment charge by $13.4m. 
The position adopted in the HYLAS 2 impairment review represent management’s best estimate of the forecasts and assumptions. 
Impairment of other assets 
There are no indicators of impairment for any other assets within Property, plant and equipment. 
HYLAS-2B 
Satellites in operation also includes a Ka-band payload that the Group operates under an indefeasible right of use (‘IRU’) agreement entered 
into in June 2015 for the estimated remaining useful life of the payload of 13.5 years. This payload is known as HYLAS-2B and Note 4 provides 
more detail on the transaction through which this payload was received. The IRU agreement is accounted for as a finance lease and a net book 
value (‘NBV’) of $33.4m is included within satellites in operation and also within the assets held under finance lease disclosure provided above.

Filiago impairment review 
The goodwill, customer lists and brand name intangibles arose from the Group obtaining control of Filiago GmbH & Co (‘Filiago’) on 1 
November 2011. Filiago is a German based Internet service provider specialising in the sale of satellite broadband services to consumer and 
enterprise customers. The Filiago operation is considered a Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’). 
The Filiago goodwill is not subject to amortisation and so is required to be reviewed annually for impairment. Filiago’s goodwill impairment 
review performed for the 30 June 2017 year end showed that an impairment of all of the goodwill was required. The impairment review also 
showed that the present value of the forecast cash flows supported the customer list intangible of $1.2m on the balance sheet at the year end. 
The recoverable amount of the Filiago CGU was determined using the value-in-use approach. The value-in-use was estimated by preparing a 
discounted cash flow forecast for Filiago over a five year period with a terminal value forecast into perpetuity after that period. 
Underlying the forecast cashflow is the position that Filiago's current management team have not been successful at achieving revenue targets 
that have been set for recent financial years. Whilst the business has been capable of maintaining a largely steady state, it has not been able to 
capitalise on the significant advantage it has been bestowed as a result of Avanti's HYLAS-2B payload coming into operational service early in 
FY17. As a result, the Group has decided to make significant changes to the way that the company is managed. However, when preparing the 
current year's impairment review, the Group has used forecast's based on what it is confident can be delivered, given the actual performance 
in recent years. 
The discounted cash flow forecast assumes a revenue growth rate of 5% per annum over the 5 year forecast period with a 2% growth rate 
applied in the terminal value calculation. Management consider that the 5% growth rate is modest based on the commercial advantages that 
Filiago has as a result of access to the HYLAS 2-B platform; namely the fastest consumer satellite broadband speeds in Europe, pan-Germany 
coverage and access to capacity in a market where supply is limited.

14. Intangible assets continued 
Filiago Impairment review continued 
Sensitivity analysis was carried out by management over the revenue growth assumptions. An increase in the growth rate to 10% from the third 
year of the forecast period, predicated on the new management team delivering stronger performance, would reduce the impairment charge by 
$2.2m. A forecast which assumes flat revenue growth during the 5 year forecast period would result in an increase in the impairment charge of 
$1.6m such that the Filiago intangible assets were fully impaired.  Management do not consider that no growth during the forecast period is an 
appropriate assumption based on the commercial and market advantages Filiago has at its disposal. Similarly, in preparing this impairment 
review, management is exercising caution in forecasting future growth rates given the failure of the business to deliver these in recent years. 
Management also noted that the variance in the impairment charges under the sensitivity analysis were not material to the Group's 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment charge nor its profit before tax. 
The present value of the forecast cash flows was calculated using the Group’s estimated pre-tax cost of capital of approximately 10.5% and is 
not considered to have a significant impact on the impairment conclusions. 
The brand names acquired in the course of the Filiago business combination have been fully amortised. The customer lists acquired of $2.4m 
are amortised on a straight line basis over a period of 15 years. At the year end, the carrying amount of the customer lists is $1.2m (2016: 
$1.1m) after charging $0.1m (2016: $0.1m) of amortisation in the year.

17. Subsidiaries continued 
The Company holds 100% ownership interest and voting power in all the above entities. 
On 1 November 2011 (the ‘date of control’) the Group took effective control of Filiago by enhancing the security over its loans with Filiago. The 
terms of the enhanced security gave the Group power over Avanti through Board control, continued exposure to variable returns of the loans 
provided to Filiago and the ability for Avanti to use its power over Filiago to affect the Group's returns.  
Since the date of control, Filiago has been accounted for as a subsidiary in the Consolidated Financial Statements because of the control now 
held but, because the Group has not purchased any equity shares in the Company, a 100% non-controlling interest is recognised ithe

19. Trade and other receivables continued 
Net trade receivables and accrued income have decreased mainly as a result of a significant provision made against a government receivable, 
described below, in addition to the comparative balance being high due to contracts reaching milestones at the end of the final quarter of that 
financial year which resulted in invoicing or revenue accruals. Of the accrued income balance $9.6m (2016: $16.4m) was due from investment 
grade customers who are either Governments or very well established corporations whose underlying customer is a government. The credit 
terms associated with the components within accrued income are largely consistent with the Group’s trade receivables which are in the range 
of 30 to 90 days.  
Government of Indonesia  
The provision for impairment of trade receivables includes $16.8m (2016: Nil) related to a full provision for the receivable due from the 
Government of Indonesia (‘GoI’) at the end of the year. This provision comprised a bad debt expense of $12.4m and following termination of the 
contract post year end, the reclassification of $4.4m from deferred income to the bad debt provision related to amounts billed but for which 
services had not been delivered at 30 June 2017.   
Avanti had contracted with the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to provide services on its Artemis satellite related to GoI’s need to firstly bring 
into use, and secondly to maintain its orbital slot at 123 degrees east. The total contract value was in excess of $30 million. Avanti performed all 
of its obligations under the contract and had extended payment deadlines for GoI to assist with administrative delays. However, after no 
payments had been received for a significant period of time, Avanti terminated the contract and has initiated arbitration proceedings in London. 
The outstanding amount is $16.8m and has been fully provided in these accounts. GoI has not disputed that the amounts are due and payable. 
Avanti is confident that the arbitration panel will rule in the Group’s favour and has provided for the debt at the year end until the uncertainty 
related to enforcing the arbitration panel’s ruling has been sufficiently reduced.  
Long Term Receivables  
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance at 30 June 2017 are two contractual long term receivables:  
 $4.4m (2016: $7.2m) related to an agreement where the outstanding debt is payable in quarterly instalments ending on 30 June 2019. 63% 
of the original balance has already been collected as at the date of approval of this Annual Report.  In addition to the instalments payable, 
interest is payable at 5.25% per annum.    
 €10.15m (2016: €10.5m) related to an agreement where the outstanding debt is payable in quarterly instalments over periods ranging from 
3-5 years. 27% of the original balance has already been collected as at the date of approval of this Annual Report. In addition to the 
instalments payable, interest is payable at rates ranging between 3.5% and 5.25% per annum.     
 
For discussion of credit risk, refer to Note 24(b).  
Company Receivables  
The Company has non-current trade and other receivables of $663.0m (2016: $642.5m) relating to amounts due from Group companies 
classified as loans receivable. The Company has current trade and other receivables of £5.5m relating to amounts due from Group companies.   
In light of the impairment of HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2 assets during the year, the Directors have reviewed intercompany receivables owed to the 
Company and as at 30 June 2017. Based on the underlying net assets recorded on the balance sheet of each subsidiary, the value of 
spectrum rights that have no corresponding balance sheet asset and the future forecast cash flows of those subsidiaries, the Directors have 
made a provision against $400.0m of intercompany receivables. The remaining carrying value of the outstanding debt of $741.6m (Note 30) is 
believed to be supported by the underlying assets of the subsidiaries.   
The provision against intercompany receivables is an estimate which is based on the difference between the book value of the receivables and 
the forecast net present value of the cash flows that the business will generate from assets held by the subsidiaries.  The sensitivities referred to 
in the Property, plant and equipment note (Note 13) give an indication of how upward or downward changes in the forecast performance of the 
HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2 assets would impact the impairment assessment.  Those sensitivities also apply to the provision for intercompany 
receivables. In addition, the assessment also notably includes HYLAS 4 cash flows forecast for a period of 19 years following that satellite 
coming into service.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out by management over the assumptions made in the HYLAS 4 forecasts relating to yield 
and growth in utilisation, with the following sensitivities identified: 
 a 10% decrease in the forecast yield over the life of the cash flow forecast would increase the provision by $57.7m.   
 a scenario in which the ramp-up of the capacity occurs at 80% of the forecast growth would increase the provision by $126.7m.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 The credit recognised in the income statement on the modification of the terms of the 10% Senior Secured Notes did not give rise to an immediate tax charge but as  
a result the subsequent amortisation of this amount will not be deductible for tax purposes. A taxable temporary difference of $35.2m (2016: NIL) has therefore been 
recognised and is included above.  The deferred tax liability is expected to reverse in the year ended 30 June 2018 once the recently announced debt for equity swap  
has concluded.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

20. Deferred taxation continued 
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available 
in the future against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. To determine the future taxable profits, reference is made to 
the latest available profit forecasts. Where the temporary differences are related to losses, relevant tax law is considered to determine the 
availability of the losses to offset against the future taxable profits. 
Recognition therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the 
deferred tax asset has been recognised. 
Significant items on which the Group has exercised accounting judgement include recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses and 
accelerated capital allowances in the United Kingdom. 
The amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements in respect of each matter are derived from the Group’s best estimation and 
judgement as described above. The inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these items means eventual resolution could differ from the 
accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group’s results and cash flows. The nature of the evidence supporting the recognition of the 
deferred tax asset included contracted revenue that will be recognised in future periods, revenue from new business signed in FY18, forecast 
revenue in future periods from opportunities in the pipeline (including modest expectations in relation to future capacity sales on HYLAS 4) and 
taxable temporary differences of an appropriate type that reverse in an appropriate period.

October 2016 Coupon Capitalisation  
The Company had 10% Senior Secured Notes (‘Original Notes’) with a nominal value of $645.0m in issue at the beginning of the year.  
On 17 October 2016, the Company announced the result of a successful consent solicitation process. The Company received consents from 
holders of 89.5% of its Senior Secured Notes to permit paying the interest due on 1 October 2016 in respect of consenting holders’ Senior 
Secured Notes in the form of additional Senior Secured Notes on the same terms as the existing Senior Secured Notes in lieu of cash. As a 
result, additional Senior Secured Notes with a nominal value of $40.4m were were issued in lieu of $28.9m of the cash coupon due on that  
date. A cash coupon of $3.4m was paid to the 10.5% of holders from whom consent was not received in October 2016.  
January 2017 Senior Secured Notes Restructuring  
On 23 January 2017, the Group completed a financial restructuring which, inter alia, modified the Senior Secured Notes with a nominal value  
of $685.4m in issue at that date into two tranches of Notes as follows:  
 $203.8m of the Original Notes were converted into $203.8m of 10%/15% Senior Secured Notes (‘PIK Toggle Notes’)  
 $481.6m of the Original Notes were converted into $481.6m of 12%/17.5% Senior Secured Notes (‘Amended Existing Notes’)     
In addition $6.5m of additional PIK Toggle Notes were issued on completion of the restructuring to settle the accrued interest on the proportion 
of Original Notes that were converted into PIK Toggle Notes. The accrued interest at the restructuring date on the proportion of the Original 
Notes that were converted into Amended Existing Notes was settled on 1 April 2017 as described below under the heading April 2017 Coupon.

PIK Toggle Notes  
The PIK Toggle Notes included the following primary modifications to the terms of the Original Notes: 
 the ability to PIK the April 2017 and October 2017 coupon payments, subject to a minimum cash threshold metric 
 an extension of the maturity date from 1 October 2019 to 1 October 2021 
 the introduction of a Margin Increase mechanism which could see the cash coupon rate of 10% and the PIK rate of 15% increase by a 
maximum of 2.5% in two steps of 1.25%, dependent on the Group’s performance against EBITDA targets 
The Group performed an assessment under its accounting policies and the requirements of IAS 39 as to whether the restructuring of the terms 
of the Original Notes into PIK Toggle Notes represented a substantial modification. As the net present value of the cash flows under the original 
terms and the modified terms was less than 10% different, the modification was accounted for as non-substantial.  
As a result, the existing debt converted of $203.8m remained on the balance sheet at its current carrying value. The debt will be accreted up to 
its final redemption value over the extended term to maturity using an amended Effective Interest Rate.  
Amended Existing Notes  
The Amended Existing Notes included the following primary modifications to the terms of the Original Notes:    
 an increase in the cash coupon from 10% to 12% 
 the ability to PIK the April 2017, October 2017 and April 2018 coupon payments, subject to a minimum cash threshold metric     
 an extension of the maturity date from 1 October 2019 to 1 October 2022     
 the introduction of a Margin Increase mechanism which could see the cash coupon rate of 10% and the PIK rate of 15% increase by a 
maximum of 2.5% in two steps of 1.25%, dependent on the Group’s performance against EBITDA targets     
The Group performed an assessment under its accounting policies and the requirements of IAS 39 as to whether the restructuring of the terms 
of the Original Notes into Amended Existing Notes represented a substantial modification. As the net present value of the cash flows under the 
original terms and the modified terms was greater than 10% different, the modification was accounted for as substantial.  
As a result, on completion of the restructuring, the carrying value of the Original Notes converted into Amended Existing Notes of $481.6m  
was de-recognised and the Amended Existing Notes with a nominal value of $481.6m were recognised on the balance sheet at the date  
of modification at their fair value of $245.6m. The fair value at the date of modification of $0.51 per note was obtained from the price of the  
first trade in the Amended Existing Notes after modification. The gain arising on substantial modification of $219.2m (Note 9) comprises the 
$236.0m difference between the derecognised financial liability and fair value of the new financial liability in addition to $16.8m of unamortised 
costs of issues and discounts related to the substantially modified Original Notes.  
New Money  
As a part of the same restructuring completed on 23 January 2017, the Group issued new PIK Toggle Notes with a nominal value of $82.5m 
with a 3% discount.  
April 2017 Coupon  
The April 2017 coupon payments due on the PIK Toggle Notes and Amended Existing Notes were both settled through the issue of additional 
notes rather than the payment of cash. $7.9m of PIK Toggle Notes were issued in respect of interest due on these notes between 23 January 
2017 and 1 April 2017. $30.6m of Amended Existing Notes were issued in respect of interest due on these notes between 2 October 2016 and 
1 April 2017. The interest accrued as at 23 January 2017 on the portion of the Original Notes converted into PIK Toggle Notes was settled 
through the issue of $6.5m of additional PIK Toggle Notes on the date that the restructuring was completed.

24. Financial instruments and risk management  
Group  
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise Bonds, finance leases, and cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’ operations. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
receivables and payables which arise directly from operations.  
The Group is subject to the risks arising from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency. Credit risk and liquidity risk also arise 
from the Group’s financial instruments. The managing of these risks, along with the day-to-day managing of treasury activities, is performed by 
the finance team.  
All financial instruments have been measured at amortised cost. As such, financial assets being cash & cash equivalents and trade and other 
receivables are classified as ‘Loans and receivables’ and financial liabilities being trade and other payables and interest-bearing liabilities have 
been classified as ‘Other financial liabilities’.

24. Financial instruments and risk management continued 
Group continued 
a) Market risk  
i) Foreign exchange risk management  
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to 
GBP and the Euro. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risk, the Group monitors the level at which natural hedges occur and continually 
reviews the need to enter into forward contracts in order to mitigate any material forecast exposure.  
At 30 June 2017, if the Euro had weakened/strengthened against the US Dollar by 5% with all other variables held constant, post tax loss would 
have worsened by $0.8m or improved by $0.8m (2016: post tax loss would have worsened by $0.4m or improved by $0.4m). 
At 30 June 2017, if Sterling had weakened/strengthened against the US Dollar by 5% with all other variables held constant, post tax loss would 
have worsened by $0.3m or improved by $0.3m (2016: post tax loss would have improved by $0.7m or worsened by $0.7m).  
The Group has a presentational currency of US Dollars. Whilst a number of companies within the Group have a functional currency that is also 
US Dollars, certain trading subsidiaries have a functional currency of Sterling or Euro. As a result, the Group experiences translation foreign 
exchange risk of assets and liabilities of non US Dollar subsidiaries on consolidation in addition to the translation of US Dollar inter-company 
loans to non US Dollar functional currency of subsidiaries that are accounted for as akin to Equity. These two factors drive the foreign exchange 
movements disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.  
The average volatility of rates during the year compared to the year end exchange rate was 3.46% and therefore management believes that a 
5% sensitivity rate provides a reasonable basis upon which to assess expected changes in foreign exchange rates.  
ii) Interest risk management  
The Group borrows in pounds Sterling and US Dollars at fixed rates of interest and does not seek to mitigate the effect of adverse movements 
in interest rates. Cash and deposits earn interest at fixed rates based on the banks’ short term treasury deposit rates. Short-term trade and 
other receivables are interest free.  
b) Credit risk management  
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and short term deposits and trade and other receivables. Cash and cash equivalents are 
deposited with high-credit quality financial institutions with a minimum rating of A+. Trade receivables are principally from Government 
customers and well established corporations. The credit quality of major customers is assessed before trading commences taking into account 
their financial position, past experience and other factors.

The provision of $21.5m (2016: $6.5m) has been raised against gross trade receivables of $44.3m (2016: $45.8m). Every major customer  
is assessed on an individual basis and we provide for bad debts when an impairment has been identified. 
In addition to trade receivables, the year-end balance sheet includes $13.7m accrued income (2016: $27.7m). $9.6m (2016: $16.4m) of 
accrued income was due from investment grade counter parties who are either Government's or very well established corporations whose 
underlying customer is a government. The credit terms associated with the components within accrued income are largely consistent to the 
Group's trade receivables which are in the range of 30 to 90 days. 
c) Liquidity risk management 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may have difficulty in obtaining funds in order to be able to meet both its day-to-day operating 
requirements and its debt servicing obligations. The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regular monitoring of its liabilities.  
Cash and cash forecasts are monitored on a daily basis and our cash requirements are met by a mixture of short term cash deposits,  
debt and finance leases.

The Group has no financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss. All financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost and all 
loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method where the time value of money is material. Appropriate allowances for estimating irrecoverable amounts are recognised  
in the Income Statement where there is evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Company 
Overall interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk are managed on a Group wide basis. Any derivatives,  
of which there are none (2016: none) are measured at fair value and intercompany balances and accruals are measured at amortised cost.  
All intercompany balances are repayable on demand and accruals and derivatives mature in less than 1 year. There is a $400.0m provision  
for impairment against the Company’s receiveables due from subsidiaries.

The weighted average share price for the year ended 30 June 2017 was £0.22 (2016: £1.56). 118,344 (2016: 118,344) of the EMI options were 
exercisable at 30 June 2017. 
The exercise price of the share based payments outstanding at 30 June 2017 was £0.01 and the weighted average remaining contractual life 
was 7.5 years (2016: 8.5 years). 
Each model has slightly different exercise criteria and therefore separate valuation models were used.

EMI Scheme 
The EMI scheme was used to issue share based payments to staff on 24 July 2007 at an exercise price of 1p. The new share based payments 
were issued for 10 years with 25% vesting at the end of years 3, 4, 5 and 6. Those staff who had previously held unvested share based 
payments in the former parent Company  at the time of the de-merger were given a shorter vesting period for these new share based 
payments. There are no performance criteria associatedperformance criteria associated with these options and they are exercisable as long as 
the option holder remains an employee of the Company. 
The weighted average inputs to the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 
Share price at date of grant   £2.16  
Fair value     £2.04   
Expected volatility   35%  
Weighted average exercise price £0.01   
Expected life   4 years  
Expected dividend yield  1%  
Risk-free interest rate   5.5%  
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the actual volatility of the Group’s share price since flotation. The expected life used in the 
model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural 
considerations.  
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The LTIP was established by the Company with approval from the Remuneration Committee to reward and incentivise the Executive Directors 
and senior managers of the Company. 
The LTIP allocations are in separate sub funds within the EBT and are subject to a discretionary Trust. The shares are subject to automatic 
revocation if certain criteria (set out below) are not met and continue to be revocable for the entire Trust period. 
The allocations into the LTIP vary for each executive. The total remaining allocation to each executive falls into the following tranches. 
i) The Core Tranche 
This element of the grant became exercisable in seven equal instalments. The first instalment was exercisable on grant and the second on 30 
June 2008. The remaining five were exercisable yearly thereafter. 
ii) The Exceptional Achievement Tranche  
This element of the grant was amended during 2010. Originally, these options were only exercisable if the average market value of the share 
exceeded £5.00 for a consecutive period of six months prior to 30 June 2010. Given the unprecedented market conditions over the previous 
year, the Remuneration Committee considered that whilst the executives had performed well and that the share price had outperformed the 
FTSE 100 and AIM All Share Index since the LTIPs were granted, the target set in the LTIP rules may still not be achieved. 
In May 2010, the Remuneration Committee agreed to extend the target date to 31 December 2010 and that the six month average target price 
should be increased £5.50. The benchmark for this tranche of LTIP was satisfied in November 2010. 
(iii) The Extraordinary Achievement Tranche 
This element of the grant was only exercisable if the market value of a share exceeded £10.00 for a consecutive period of six months before 30 
June 2013. At 30 June 2013, the criteria of the extraordinary achievement tranche had not been met, therefore the outstanding shares were 
returned to the EBT.

iv) The Share Award Tranche 
The share award LTIP 2015 was issued 30 July 2013 to 30 June 2015. Two-thirds of the award was based on revenue performance for the year 
ending 30 June 2015. One-third of the award was based on the share price as at 30 June 2015. 
In 2015, the Remuneration Committee determined that 50% of the 2015 award should be made but that, in the longer term interests of the 
Company, vesting should be made subject to the achievement of an additional criterion that the share price should remain at or above a certain 
level for three consecutive months. This amended award shall lapse if this is not achieved by 30 June 2020. 
A second LTIP award was issued on 14 January 2014 to 30 June 2016. Consistent with the earlier LTIP, two-thirds of the award is based on 
revenue performance for the year ending 30 June 2016. Therefore there is no charge relating to that part of the LTIP. One-third of the award is 
based on the share price as at 30 June 2016. The revenue performance and share price criteria were not met as at 30 June 2016. However, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that, in the longer term interests of the Company, the award should remain extant but vesting should be 
made subject to the achievement of an additional criterion that the share price should remain at or above a certain level for three consecutive 
months. This amended award shall lapse if this is not achieved by 30 June 2020. 
A third LTIP award was issued on 5 November 2014 to 30 June 2017. As consistent with the earlier LTIP awards, two-thirds of the award is 
based on revenue performance for the year ending 30 June 2017. Therefore there is no charge relating to that part of the LTIP. One-third of the 
award is based on the share price as at 30 June 2017. The revenue performance and share price criteria were not met as at 30 June 2017. 
However, the Remuneration Committee determined that, in the longer term interests of the Company, the award should remain extant but 
vesting should be made subject to the achievement of an additional criterion that the share price should remain at or above a certain level for 
three consecutive months. This amended award shall lapse if this is not achieved by 30 June 2020. 
A fourth LTIP award was issued on 9 October 2015 to 30 June 2018. Consistent with the earlier LTIP awards, two-thirds of the award is based 
on revenue performance for the year ending 30 June 2018. Therefore there is no charge relating to that part of LTIP. One-third of the award is 
based on a share price as at 30 June 2018. 
No LTIP award was made in the financial year ending 30 June 2017.

Unapproved Schemes 
At 30 June 2017, there were 13 unapproved schemes in place, established at various dates since 2007. 
Under each scheme, the options are issued for 10 years with 33% vesting at the end of years 3, 4 and 5. 
Prior to 1 May 2015, nine of the schemes (noted below) required the market value of the shares to be £10.00 or more per share for a 
consecutive period of six months in order for the vesting conditions to be met. On 1 May 2016, the remaining options in these schemes were 
cancelled, and reissued where the option holder continued to be employed by the Group. The reissued options require the market value of the 
shares to be £5.00 or more per share for a consecutive period of six months in order for the vesting conditions to be met. Other terms remained 
the same. 
Unapproved schemes reissued with £5.00 share price vesting criteria:      
 Unapproved share option plan (March 2010)      
 Unapproved share option plan (October 2010)      
 Unapproved share option plan (April 2011)      
 Unapproved share option plan (July 2011)

 Unapproved share option plan (July 2013)      
 Unapproved share option plan (May 2014)      
 Unapproved share option plan (May 2015)      
For all other schemes, there are no performance criteria and the options are exercisable as long as the time vesting criteria are met and the 
option holder remains with the company. 
Save as you earn (‘SAYE’) schemes 
The SAYE schemes were established in November 2011 and November 2013 and were open to all employees of the Company at the time. 
SAYE is an HMRC approved all employee savings-related share option scheme under which employees save up to a limit of £250.00 on a four 
weekly basis with an option to buy shares in the Company at the end of a three year period at a discount of up to 20% of the market value on 
the grant date. Options are not subject to performance conditions. All options are exercisable from three years from the date of grant. All 
options expire six months from their exercise date.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other related party transactions 
Of the non-executive directors, Craig Chobor is a Managing Director of Solus Alternative Asset Management (“Solus”), Michael Leitner is a 
managing partner of Tennenbaum Capital Partners (“Tennenbaum”), and Peter Reed is Chief Investment Officer at Great Elm Capital 
Management (“Great Elm”). Each of those funds were significant holders of Avanti’s High Yield Bonds during the reporting period and at the 
year end.  Solus is also a major shareholder of the Company’s Ordinary Share capital.  These non-executive directors were appointed as 
directors on 27 January 2017 immediately following the successful completion of a debt restructuring. The Company considers that the 
directors became related parties from the date of their appointment as directors.  The terms of the debt restructuring that immediately 
preceded the directors appointment was completed on the same terms for all holders of the same class of notes.  
During the period from 27 January 2017 up to the balance sheet date, transactions with these related parties related to accrued interest of 
$27.1m, $7.8m, and $6.0m for Solus, Tennenbaum, and Great Elm Capital respectively on the outstanding loan notes on terms consistent with 
the contractual terms of the notes and as a result consistent with all other holders of the same class of Notes. On 1 April 2017, the accrued 
interest on the 2021 Notes and the 2023 Notes of $18.5m, $5.3m, and $4.1m owed to Solus, Tennenbaum, and Great Elm Capital respectively 
was settled through the issue of additional loan notes. There was $16.2m, $4.7m, and $3.6m accrued interest payable to Solus, Tennenbaum, 
and Great Elm Capital respectively at 30 June 2017, included within accruals.

Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
32. Post balance sheet events 
In July 2017 the Company drew down $100 million of the three-year super senior facility agreed in June 2017 which has an interest  
rate of 7.5%. 
In November 2017 the Group terminated its contract with MOD of Indonesia and made provisions against the year-end debt of $16.8 million. 
As described in the going concern accounting policy in Note 2, on 13 December 2017, the Company announced that it had reached 
agreement with noteholders representing approximately 62% of its outstanding 2021 Notes and 55% of its outstanding 2023 Notes  
(together, the “Majority Holders”) and shareholders representing 34% of its existing issued share capital to implement a restructuring  
of the Group’s indebtedness.  
The restructuring consists of repayment of the outstanding 12%/17.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 of $557 million by issuing approximately 
2.0 billion new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in Avanti Communication Group plc which will represent approximately 92.5% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital. This remains subject to approval by the Group’s shareholders in addition to a consent solicitation 
process, and UK Scheme of Arrangement process if needed, which will be completed in January and February 2018. 
In addition the terms of the 10%/15% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 will be revised such that the interest rate will be reduced to 9% for both 
cash and PIK and their maturity will be extended by one year to 2022. This remains subject to a formal UK Scheme of Arrangement process 
with the bondholders.
