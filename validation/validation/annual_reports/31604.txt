 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
PURPOSEFUL
AND DISCIPLINED
GROWTH
Annual report and accounts 2017 2017 at
2017 has been a year of purposeful and disciplined growth to develop our 
market positions at slot-constrained airports. We have grown our share in  
a number of key airports, with our fleet up-gauging process also allowing  
us to add capacity where our competitors cannot.
Our sustained focus on cost control and lean initiatives is supported  
by our fleet development and increased use of digital to improve our 
customers’ experience. 
We moved quickly in response to the UK’s referendum vote to leave the 
European Union by establishing a new airline, easyJet Europe, in Austria. 
easyJet Europe is now operational and will enable easyJet to continue to 
operate flights both across and domestically within all European countries 
after the UK has left the EU, regardless of the outcome of talks on a future 
UK-EU aviation agreement. 
We continue investing in innovation, which has already revolutionised our 
customer offer and we expect to continue to harness technology to deliver 
cost and reliability benefits as well as exciting improvements in customer 
experiences that will keep easyJet a structural winner at the forefront of 
 the aviation industry.
easyJet’s customer proposition continues its positive development and, 
backed by a strong balance sheet, will deliver long-term shareholder value. STRATEGIC REPORT

and we invested in increased resilience which will deliver 
long-term benefits to easyJet and its customers. We also 
continue to ensure that we have a strong and flexible balance 
sheet to underpin our plans for the future.
RESULTS
As a result of this strategy we have been able to deliver a 
robust performance this year. Our passenger growth was 
healthy, increasing by 9.7% to 80.2 million, and revenue 
increased to £5,047 million, an increase of 8.1%. Headline profit 
before tax was £408 million, despite the impact of £101 million 
from adverse foreign exchange rates. Reported profit after  
tax was £305 million.
We have achieved a headline return on capital employed  
of 11.9% as we start to take deliveries of our new fleet order, 
including our first A320neo aircraft.
We are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable returns  
to shareholders and in our dividend policy. As a result we are 
recommending a dividend of 40.9 pence per share based on 
our payout policy of 50% of headline profit after tax.
BOARD
In July Carolyn McCall resigned to become CEO of ITV plc. 
After joining in 2010, Carolyn built and led the management 
team that transformed easyJet’s performance in every  
respect. She put easyJet’s passengers and people at the  
heart of the business, having first built a solid operational 
performance. This has seen both the number and loyalty of 
easyJet’s passengers grow as a result and has led to sustained 
and continuing financial success, which has been shared with 
shareholders with a more than trebling of easyJet’s share price 
and the payment of £1.2 billion in dividends. On 10 November 
2017 the Board announced the appointment of Johan 
Lundgren as its new Chief Executive. Johan was previously 
Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer of TUI Group. He will  
be joining the Company on 1 December 2017, with Carolyn 
stepping down on 30 November.
This year we welcomed Moya Greene to the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. Moya brings significant transport and 
logistics expertise as well as her experience as a FTSE 100 
Chief Executive. At the same time François Rubichon decided 
to step down after three years on the Board. Keith Hamill also 
indicated that he would retire, but kindly agreed to remain  
on the Board whilst we found a successor to Carolyn McCall. 
François and Keith leave easyJet with our gratitude and  
best wishes.
PEOPLE
Once again I would like to thank all of our people, in particular 
those on the front line as they represent easyJet at its best in 
sometimes challenging situations. We continue to invest in our 
pilots and crew to deliver excellent service and as we continue 
to grow. In addition, I would also like to thank those in support 
functions who have participated in the organisational review 
during the year, which creates a better platform for the future. 
With both of these communities I believe that easyJet is 
building a strong and sustainable advantage for the long term.

Chief Executive’s review
easyJet delivered a robust performance in the 2017 financial 
year. During the period the airline continued to make good 
progress in its purposeful growth strategy, making disciplined 
investments to maintain and grow its market-leading positions 
in Europe’s primary, slot-constrained airports. easyJet’s  
focused capacity growth of 8.5%, includes a number of 
time-sensitive opportunities in slot-constrained airports such  
as Amsterdam, which is now full. Over seven million more 
passengers flew with easyJet this year, representing an 
increase of 9.7%, at historically high load factors of 92.6%. 
This reflects the strength of easyJet’s network and 
customer proposition.
The airline’s disciplined strategy will enable it to be a 
structural winner within its chosen markets in the European 
short-haul market. 
Total revenue increased by 8.1% to £5,047 million  
(2016: £4,669 million).
Revenue per seat is broadly flat at £58.23 (down 4.5% at 
constant currency
(1)
), driven by:
• The persisting low fuel price environment, resulting in high 
levels of market capacity growth (7.4% growth in easyJet’s 
markets).
• An aggressive pricing environment which saw net ticket 
revenue per seat fall by 7.8% at constant currency.
• Ancillary revenue
(2)
 which grew by 17.8% to £986 million as 
high load factors and consumer-focused initiatives helped 
to offset ticket pricing pressures.
• Within this, non-seat revenue increased by 9.3% to  
£89 million, supported by strong inflight sales of easyJet’s 
enhanced product offering.
easyJet’s focus on rigorous cost control continues to deliver 
excellent results and supported the investment in operational 
resilience. Headline cost per seat increased by 2.4% to 
£53.52 driven by an adverse headline foreign exchange impact 
of £308 million (£3.56 per seat) and the costs of disruption, 
which remains a major industry challenge. At constant 
currency the headline cost per seat decreased by 4.4% as 
easyJet continued to benefit from its hedged fuel position. The 
overall cost performance is driven by:
• Fuel cost reduction of 19.2% per seat at constant currency.
• Lean initiatives in: 
 – airports and ground handling, leveraging easyJet’s scale 
across the network; 
 – engineering and maintenance savings in the supplier 
base; and
 – reduced navigation charges. 
• Up-gauging of fleet with the delivery of an additional 21 
186-seat A320 and two A320neo aircraft and retrofitting of 
49 existing 180-seat A320s to 186-seats.
This helped to offset:
• A continued increase in the combined impact on cost from 
disruption of EU 261 claims and an increasingly congested 
European aviation infrastructure. 
CAROLYN MCCALL DBE
Chief Executive
Building momentum
(1) Constant currency is calculated by comparing the 2017 financial year performance translated at the 2016 financial year effective exchange rate to 
the 2016 financial year reported performance, excluding foreign exchange gains and losses on balance sheet revaluations
(2) Ancillary revenue includes revenue from the provision of checked baggage, allocated seating and change fees, and also includes non-seat revenue 
which arises from commissions earned from services sold on behalf of partners and inflight sales. 
Our planned approach of 
achieving number one or 
two positions at Europe’s 
leading airports, friendly 
and efficient customer 
service and a continuous 
focus on sustainable cost 
control has put easyJet at 
a strategic advantage 
during a period when there 
have been bankruptcies 
and some airlines have 
struggled operationally.

STRATEGIC REPORT
PURPOSEFUL INVESTMENT TO BUILD  
STRONG NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO 
NETWORK POSITIONS 
easyJet’s strategy is focused on primary airports, serving 
valuable catchment areas that represent Europe’s top markets 
by GDP. This helps to drive both leisure and business travel. 
These are strong, existing markets, built up over a period of 
time by legacy carriers. easyJet’s portfolio of peak time slots at 
airports, where either total slot availability or availability at 
customer-friendly times is constrained, further reinforces its 
competitive advantage.
easyJet currently holds 18 number one market positions by 
share of seat capacity and has identified a number of potential 
targets for the next five years where GDP and passenger 
volumes are high, and where there is a weak incumbent and/or 
where there is no clear winner today. easyJet’s network 
decisions are not driven by cost but by the desire to secure 
strong, long-term, sustainable and profitable positions in key 
airports, in order to secure long-term, sustainable returns for 
shareholders. Number one or number two positons to weaker 
legacy incumbents in key airports enable the airline to offer a 
better proposition to customers and higher, sustainable returns 
for investors.
easyJet will continue to pursue this strategy with clarity and 
purpose. Looking ahead, easyJet expects that its capacity 
growth will be targeted at deepening existing number one 
positions or converting number two positions into number  
one positions, as well as seeding new number one and  
two positions.
easyJet takes a disciplined approach to capital allocation, 
balancing its network by deploying aircraft to where it can 
achieve the highest returns. easyJet’s strategy achieves  
this through:
1. Building number one positions both at primary airports and 
on its routes, which drives significantly greater contribution:
 – 98% of easyJet’s capacity touches an airport where  
it has the number one or number two position by 
market share. 
2. Investing in scale:
 – Leading positions, route frequencies and multiple 
destinations create flexibility for customers, as well  
as reinforcing the easyJet brand to ensure that it is  
‘top of mind’.
3. Investing with purpose:
 – easyJet has a track record of generating above the  
cost of capital returns from purposeful investments 
within a three-year period. 
easyJet regularly reviews its route network in order to 
maximise returns and exploit demand opportunities in  
the market. During the 2017 financial year easyJet added  
79 routes to the network. Reflecting the airline’s discipline,  
it also discontinued 20 routes which either did not meet 
expected return criteria, or became secondary to a more 
attractive route elsewhere. During the year easyJet also took 
the decision to close its base in Hamburg in March 2018, with 
greater returns available by redeploying those aircraft 
elsewhere in the network.
easyJet has continued to focus on key markets, growing 
market share in the UK, Switzerland and Italy. Growth in  
market share was more robust in France and the airline’s 
announcement that it will launch a new base in Bordeaux in 
spring 2018, will create the airline’s sixth base in the country.

(5) Capacity and market share figures from OAG. Size of European market based on internal easyJet definition. Historical data based on 12 month period

• Investment in resilience including an additional light aircraft 
in Milan Malpensa, additional spare parts distributed across 
the network and three wet leased aircraft to add flexibility 
in the schedule.
• Additional ownership and financing costs that were 
anticipated following investment in the long-term growth 
of the airline. 
• Inflationary cost increases such as agreed crew deals and 
start-up costs related to the introduction of a new ground 
handling company, DHL, at Gatwick. 
easyJet remains on track to deliver flat headline cost per 
seat excluding fuel at constant currency from the 2015 
financial year to the 2019 financial year, assuming normal 
levels of disruption and excluding Air Berlin. 
easyJet continues to prioritise its sector leading balance sheet 
and dividend policy:
• Cash and money market deposits
(3)
 at 30 September 2017 
of £1,328 million (2016: £969 million) with net cash of  
£357 million (2016: £213 million).
• Headline return on capital employed
(4)
 at 11.9%, in line with 
easyJet’s long-term benchmark. 
• Dividend payout ratio of 50% of headline profit after 
tax delivering a proposed ordinary dividend per share  
of 40.9 pence.
easyJet is well prepared for the UK’s exit from the  
European Union: 
• Following the successful award of its Air Operator 
Certificate (AOC) and airline operating licence in Austria, 
easyJet Europe airline will be operating with more than  
10 aircraft by the end of 2017 and is in the process of 
registering more aircraft over the next 12 months.
• A resolution will be proposed at easyJet’s AGM to update 
easyJet’s Articles of Association relating to shareholder 
ownership controls to ensure compliance with EU 
ownership requirements.
MARKET ENVIRONMENT
easyJet operates in the European short-haul aviation market, 
with a focused business model that has enabled it to 
consistently generate high levels of profitability. As competitors 
continue to struggle to restructure their high cost bases or 
operate with inadequate financial resources, easyJet is well 
positioned selectively to strengthen its market positions. 
Economic trends remain favourable across Europe with 
continued GDP growth supporting spending in all easyJet’s 
major countries.
The total European short-haul market
(5)
 grew by 5.9% year-on-
year and by 7.4% in easyJet’s markets. This was driven by 
easyJet’s own growth and competitor growth supported 
primarily by a continued low fuel price. easyJet delivered 
particularly strong growth in France and Switzerland.
STRATEGIC PROGRESS
easyJet is delivering through its six strategic pillars:
1. Purposeful investment to build strong number one and two 
network positions
2. A lean cost advantage
3. Customer and operational excellence
4. Data and digital
5. Enhance revenue growth
6. The best people 12 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s review / continued
Portugal and Spain
easyJet operates out of all five major airports in Portugal and 
flies both international and domestic routes. At 30 September 
2017, the airline had eight aircraft based in Portugal. easyJet 
increased capacity by 14% in the year as it continued to 
establish its position in both bases (Lisbon and Oporto). 
easyJet operates at 20 airports in Spain and serves over 150 
routes. At 30 September 2017, the airline had seven aircraft 
based in Spain. In March, easyJet opened its first seasonal base 
in Palma de Mallorca, a major leisure destination with a focus 
on the summer market. This has been a major success and  
has the potential to be replicated elsewhere. easyJet grew 
capacity in Spain by 13% in the year as it continued to build  
its presence at both Palma and its base in Barcelona.
A LEAN COST ADVANTAGE
easyJet is committed to maintaining its structural cost 
advantage in the markets where it operates, primarily against 
the legacy airlines. 
Through its Lean programme which is embedded in the airline’s 
culture, easyJet continues to identify both short-term 
efficiencies and longer term structural cost savings, leveraging 
its increasing scale. These savings enable the airline to offset 
the effects of underlying inflation and build flexibility to help 
mitigate revenue pressure. 
The Lean programme has been able to deliver sustainable  
cost reduction: £400 million of savings have been achieved 
over the last seven years, with £85 million saved this year, and 
2017 financial year headline cost per seat, excluding fuel, at 
constant currency is marginally lower than the 2015 financial 
year. This is despite the regulatory environment and current 
inflationary pressures.
As a result, easyJet remains committed to its target of flat unit 
headline cost performance between the 2015 financial year 
and the 2019 financial year, at constant currency and before 
the effect of fuel, assuming normal levels of disruption and 
excluding Air Berlin. 
Savings will be delivered in the following areas:
Airport and ground handling 
• As easyJet increases in size, the airline will drive further 
economies of scale from long-term deals with airports and 
ground handling operators. Management continues to 
work with airports that will reward easyJet’s commitment 
and growth with attractive financial packages. For example, 
despite 80% of outbound airports being regulated, airport 
and ground handling costs decreased by 1.3% per seat at 
constant currency.
• 20% of all easyJet passengers now travel through an 
automated bag drop area with further automation planned 
to be rolled out across the network. Automatic gates are 
also being trialled for boarding.
Maintenance and engineering 
• easyJet is driving further efficiencies from its contract for 
maintenance and the provision of spare parts, which 
started in October 2015.
• easyJet is using data science and its strong relationship 
with Airbus to support predictive maintenance, which will 
drive further long-term cost savings.
• Innovation continues to drive down costs. For example, 
the BladeFix application determines the most efficient way 
of replacing blades, resulting in savings of c.US$250,000 
per year. 
easyJet also invested in high capacity growth in its city 
strategy: in Venice and Naples to improve its number one 
positions as well as maintaining share in the slot-constrained 
Amsterdam airport, where the airport is now at full capacity. 
easyJet’s announcement regarding its purchase of parts of  
Air Berlin’s operations is consistent with this strategy.
Overall easyJet grew capacity by 8.5% in the period, with its 
market share for easyJet’s markets up 0.8 percentage points 
to 31.6%. Progress in easyJet’s main markets is as follows:
United Kingdom
easyJet has strong market positions in all of the UK’s busiest 
airports, with 10 number one airports and two number two 
airports. This includes 47% share of short-haul capacity at 
London Gatwick and 43% share at Luton. At 30 September 
2017, 146 aircraft were based in the UK, with 93 at four London 
airports. easyJet increased its capacity in the UK during the 
year by 8%, with significant growth targeted at maintaining its 
share of the London market through Luton and Gatwick and 
increasing capacity at Edinburgh, Bristol and Manchester 
airports in particular.
France
easyJet currently has a number one position in Nice, with 
number two positions in Paris, Lyon, Toulouse and Bordeaux. 
At 30 September 2017, the airline had 30 aircraft based in 
France. easyJet increased capacity in the year by 11%, 
significantly ahead of the overall market, to consolidate its 
presence in Paris and increase its share in the regions. With an 
overall market share at 30 September 2017 of 15%, easyJet has 
increased its share of the market in France over the last year 
by almost one percentage point.
Italy
easyJet has a number one position at Milan Malpensa, Naples 
and Venice. At 30 September 2017, the airline had 31 aircraft 
based in Italy. easyJet increased capacity in the year by 7%, 
further increasing its investment in Venice, where easyJet now 
has 26% share; Naples (30% share); and consolidating its 
position in Milan Malpensa (40% share).
Switzerland
easyJet has a strong position in Switzerland and is number one 
in both Geneva and Basel with 43% and 60% market share 
respectively. At 30 September 2017, the airline had 24 aircraft 
based in Switzerland. easyJet increased capacity in the year by 
11%, increasing its share in both Geneva and Basel, against 
overall market growth of 8%. 
Germany
In Germany, easyJet has two bases, at Berlin Schönefeld, 
where it has a number two position, and Hamburg which it has 
now decided to close from March 2018. At 30 September 
2017, the airline had 16 aircraft based in Germany. easyJet 
increased capacity by 7% in Germany during the period as it 
invested in maintaining its strong market share of the Berlin 
market. The transaction with Air Berlin will secure a leading 
position at Berlin Tegel airport and a number one overall 
position in the Berlin market (Europe’s third most popular 
destination for overnight stays).
Netherlands
easyJet holds the number two position behind KLM at 
Amsterdam Schiphol airport, which is now at full capacity.  
At 30 September 2017, the airline had eight aircraft based  
in the Netherlands, which has increased purposefully since 
opening the base in March 2015. easyJet increased capacity  
by 8% in the year as it began to annualise the high growth 
from the previous two years, focusing on adding frequencies 
to existing destinations and capturing first wave demand  
from business passengers.  13 www.easyJet.com
STRATEGIC REPORT
• As a result of the UK’s referendum vote to leave the 
European Union, easyJet has established an airline in 
Austria. This will secure the flying rights of the c.30% of the 
network that remains wholly within and between EU states, 
excluding the UK. This one-off cost, comprised mainly of 
aircraft registration costs, is expected to total up to £10 
million over three years, with £2 million incurred in the 2017 
financial year. 
• Expenses associated with implementing the organisational 
review in the 2017 financial year totalled £6 million. 
Approximately £3 million is expected in the final phase of 
this process in the 2018 financial year. Annualised savings 
are expected to be £15 million.
• Balance sheet foreign exchange gains were £2 million  
and the fair value adjustment associated with the bond 
cross-currency interest rate swap was a £1 million loss.
CUSTOMER AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE 
easyJet continues to challenge itself to make things easier for 
our customers and deliver good operational performance 
during a challenging time for the industry. We know that 
airport and airspace congestion will not change overnight, but 
we are investing in the tools to ensure better performance and 
improve our On-Time Performance (OTP).
In the 2017 financial year, cancellations and delays decreased 
by 4% to 7,047 (2016 7,357) but OTP decreased by one 
percentage point to 76%. The challenges of working at 
Gatwick, where easyJet outperforms most of its direct 
competitors on OTP, continue to have an impact on the rest 
of the network; OTP excluding the UK was three percentage 
points higher at 79%. In particular, easyJet was affected by a 
number of external factors:
• Severe weather at peak times of year. 
• Strikes around the network including French Air Traffic 
Control (ATC), Italian Ground Handling and Berlin  
Ground Handling.
• Reduced capacity as French ATC perform systems 
upgrades in Bordeaux, similar to the Brest upgrades 
last year.
• Capacity limitation events at Gatwick airport such as the 
disruption caused by a burst tyre on an Air Canada flight  
in July.

Crew 
• easyJet’s business model of employing crew across Europe 
on local contracts delivers significant value in attracting 
and retaining high quality crew. The airline believes this is 
the best long-term and sustainable resourcing model in  
the markets it operates in. easyJet’s investment in this area 
has driven structural benefits, including low crew turnover, 
at less than 4% for pilots, and a strong pipeline of pilots  
and crew. 
• easyJet is investing significant resources to improve 
schedule and rostering efficiency, which will improve 
productivity and create a more stable working environment 
for its crew.
Overhead and IT 
• easyJet continues to implement its new organisational 
design which will bring significant efficiency to the business, 
as well as the ability to leverage scale in overhead for future 
growth. This will deliver c.£15 million of annualised saving, 
with a six to nine month payback on the investment. 
• Increasing investment into data and digital to increase 
simplicity, enhance flexibility and drive efficiency.
• Continuing end-to-end review of the supplier base in all 
areas of the business to reduce cost and drive innovative 
thinking about the way the airline works in the future.
Up-gauging and efficient fleet management 
• Moving from 156 seats on an A319 to 186 seats on an 
A320neo aircraft is expected to deliver a cost per seat 
saving of around 11% to 13%. This is being achieved by 
increasing the proportion of higher gauge A320 aircraft in 
the fleet:
 – all new A320 deliveries will be fitted with 186 seats;
 – retrofitting the existing fleet of 180-seat A320s; and
 – introduction of the 186-seat A320neo from June 2017. 
• The addition of A321neo aircraft to the fleet from July 2018 
is expected to deliver an 8% to 9% cost per seat saving 
compared to an A320neo, primarily due to their 235-seat 
configuration.
• easyJet has built fleet flexibility which means the airline  
is able to either increase or decrease the fleet growth 
programme, allowing it to manage ownership costs in line 
with external factors.
Fuel 
• easyJet continues to optimise its commercial and  
logistical fuel supply arrangements, working closely with  
its fuel providers.
Non-headline items 
As indicated previously, easyJet has incurred a number 
of non-headline costs during the 2017 financial year. These 
costs are separately disclosed as non-headline profit before 
tax items:
• easyJet transacted the sale and leaseback of 10 aircraft  
in December 2016 to de-risk the exit from the business  
of the ageing A319 fleet. easyJet has incurred a non-cash 
charge of £16 million. Of this, £10 million relates to a loss  
on disposal, which reflects the timing of the transaction 
and the specific aircraft sold. A further £6 million relates  
to a one-off catch up in the maintenance provision due  
to the differences in accounting treatment between  
owned and leased aircraft. The proceeds of the transaction 
were US $144 million and are reflected in the cash flow 
statement. The next tranche of 10 has now completed  
for proceeds of US $137 million, which will result in a 
non-headline charge of approximately £20 million in  
the 2018 financial year. 14 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s review / continued
Looking ahead, the next phase of the Airport of the Future will 
focus on the boarding process, using facial recognition 
technology and e-Gates to reduce queuing time, speed up 
boarding and improve the efficiency of our turn arounds. Trials 
of these new innovations will commence in Gatwick and Luton 
in 2018.
DATA AND DIGITAL
easyJet has been at the forefront of digital innovation in the 
airline industry and its digital strategy is a core part of easyJet’s 
wider strategy. Its capability helps to build customer loyalty, 
drive revenue growth, secure cost savings and deliver greater 
customer satisfaction. easyJet’s increasingly sophisticated use 
of data will enable the business to make travel even easier and 
more affordable in the long-term.
Customers are now making 27% of all e-commerce bookings 
through mobile platforms, an increase of 5.4 percentage points 
from 30 September 2016, as functionality and accessibility 
improve further. The ability to simplify transactions continues 
to improve with technology such as Apple Pay seeing strong 
adoption and representing 10% of all app bookings. 24% of 
passengers now use mobile boarding passes (9.5 percentage 
points increase from 2016 financial year) and 40 airports 
support real time data exchange for gate information and bag 
drop. easyJet sent 11.6 million “go to gate” push notifications 
during the period. 
Innovation and digital leadership
easyJet continues to innovate to maintain its advantage, 
improving the customer experience and increasing efficiency. 
This is being delivered across the business, from the new 
commercial platform and easyJet Worldwide; within the lean 
initiatives; in operations with the rollout of iPads in Palma for 
our crew members; and in engineering where we are reducing 
both fuel use and carbon emissions. 
The new website customer interface, rolled out this year, is a 
key point of differentiation and provides a platform to release 
new features and enhancements. This has already delivered 
increases in conversion and attachment rates as customers 
find it easier to search for flights, compare routes, times and 
fares and see more relevant information on seats and bags. 
Further opportunities for commercial optimisation are planned.
easyJet has continued to enhance its app capabilities, building 
on its consistent 4.5 star rating, 23 million downloads and over 
600,000 uses per day. In addition to functionality that 
improves the travel experience and drives loyalty, such as 
mobile boarding passes and the flight tracker, easyJet’s app  
is increasingly being used to manage disruption, combining 
better communication with the ability for passengers to 
self-handle, easily rebooking their flights and securing  
pre-approved hotel accommodation. 
Through the app customers can also add bags, seats,  
hotels, cars, insurance, lounges, transfers and, most recently, 
in-destination activities. During the year, easyJet announced 
initiatives with its first two Founders Factory portfolio 
companies, Flio and Lucky Trip, and will be integrating both 
into the easyJet travel app during 2018, delivering customer 
benefits in airport experience and travel experience. This 
activity is already getting significant traction with mobile 
customers, who are spending over 35% more than web-only 
customers and in-destination mobile purchases are growing 
250% year-on-year.
easyJet invested in a number of initiatives in the year to drive 
better On-Time Performance and improve operational 
resilience:
• Engineering initiatives to increase aircraft availability: 
easyJet has set up an Aircraft On Ground Response Team 
and added a second light aircraft at Milan Malpensa to the 
one at Luton to ensure engineers can fix aircraft more 
quickly, saving c.£6 million in the summer; spare parts have 
been distributed around the network to support a faster 
response, guided by predictive maintenance analysis; and 
predictive maintenance is also being used in scheduled 
checks and is expected to reduce technical operational 
interruptions by up to 20%.
• Gatwick North Terminal consolidation: since January 
easyJet has been able to improve operations and customer 
experience at Gatwick; and 80% of stands are now 
dedicated to easyJet aircraft, enabling more efficient 
ground handling processes and consistent turn times. 
• Customer communications: easyJet has increased its push 
notifications to customers, to manage disruption better; 
technology is also supporting more consistent 
communication between Operations Control, ground 
handling teams and on-board crew to passengers; and 
easyJet has now introduced further automation to the 
compensation claims process to improve customer 
satisfaction and reduce processing costs.
• Schedule and rosters: easyJet has introduced breaks to  
its schedule and increased block times (reducing asset 
utilisation) to ensure it can deliver a more robust schedule 
for its customers. In addition, three aircraft were wet leased 
this summer to build flexibility and a further two spare 
aircraft made available to add resilience.
• Employing new technology: increasing the use of digital 
technology in recording aircraft maintenance and causes 
of delays. Additionally, we are piloting the use of solutions 
such as zero-emission electric tugs to reduce noise and 
pollution as well as drones to speed up the aircraft 
maintenance process.
Over the last three years easyJet has been working with 
Gatwick Airport to create its Airport of the Future at the  
North Terminal. This has seen the introduction of mobile 
hosting, which provides information on baggage and departure 
belts for 5.5 million customers, the introduction of the world’s 
largest Autobag drop and upgrades to security resulting in 
reduced waiting times. Following these upgrades, queue times 
at manual bag drop desks have declined with 90% of our 
customers waiting fewer than five minutes. The North Terminal 
now processes 600 passengers per lane per hour, up from 
170 last year. This has seen Customer Satisfaction scores for 
baggage drop wait time increase by 22 percentage points 
year-on-year. Autobag drop has been rolled out to six further 
airports in total since introduction at Gatwick.
easyJet is also pleased to have announced a strategic 
partnership with DHL. They are now working with easyJet to 
transform ground handling at Gatwick airport with new ideas, 
innovation and a razor sharp approach to efficiency and 
consistency. 15 www.easyJet.com
STRATEGIC REPORT
Loyalty and data
easyJet continues to benefit from increasingly loyal customers. 
During the year 75% of seats were booked by returning 
customers, representing an increase of nearly six million 
compared to 2016. easyJet has seen significant increases 
in returning customer loyalty in its core markets of the UK  
(2.0 million customers) and Switzerland (1.4 million customers), 
with strong increases also in France and Germany. 
easyJet is building increasingly strong relationships with its 
customers through the use of personalised data. easyJet’s 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database of 
marketable customers increased by 5.6% during the year  
to 27.7 million. easyJet’s loyalty scheme Flight Club is also 
producing demonstrable benefits, driving higher retention  
and higher satisfaction than non-members. Over 50% of  
Flight Club members fly 20 or more times a year, with just 
under 40% representing business or commuter customers.
The introduction of a new Data Hub, will allow easyJet to  
store significant amounts of customer, operational and 
financial data in a secure environment. This builds on the 
strong foundations of the existing CRM programme and  
will deliver increasingly personalised communications to 
customers. Investments in effective CRM bring tangible  
cost and revenue benefits, including:
• Reducing marketing cost per seat by 25% over the  
past five years.
• Enhancing customer value by over 30% – with 29% more 
customers in our CRM programme booking flights versus 
those outside the programme:
 – of those customers, each generates 50% more flight 
revenue and 47% more ancillary revenue.
ENHANCED REVENUE GROWTH 
easyJet has a programme to develop additional revenue 
streams as well as enhancing existing revenue streams, 
leveraging its primary airport-focused network, cost focus  
and track record of innovation. 
The airline is exploring new distribution channels, partner 
agreements and structures such as connectivity with other 
airlines. easyJet is also increasingly using data science to 
support revenue-enhancing initiatives, for example using 
customer profiling on specific sectors and routes.
During the 2017 financial year, bag revenue increased by 30% 
above projection due to improved pricing algorithms. easyJet 
also began the trial of artificial intelligence to conduct market 
diagnostics to help it react faster to changes in competitor 
pricing and other dynamics, as well as to improve route 
forecasting and to inform pricing strategy.
Business passengers
During the year the total number of business passengers has 
increased by 3.6%, against a backdrop of capacity investment 
weighted towards leisure routes. Business passengers 
comprised 16% of easyJet’s customer base, reflecting the mix 
of routes flown. The business passenger premium 
outperformed the prior year at £11.58, up 9.5% versus the 2016 
financial year. This was aided by the recovery from shock 
events (which disproportionately impacted short-term travel) 
and an increase in Business Flexi revenue.
With the proposition now well established, easyJet is evolving 
the product offering, to drive better distribution and reduce 
costs. This year negotiations with Global Distribution System 
(GDS) partners helped to drive costs savings of over £1 million.
Additional revenue streams
During the year, easyJet has seen strong growth in its ancillary 
(including non-seat) revenue of 17.8% to £986 million, 
offsetting pressure on ticket prices from the external 
environment. For example easyJet has seen excellent early 
results from new initiatives in its baggage strategy as well as 
continued strong pick-up in allocated seating, reflecting 
changes to consumer behaviour. In September easyJet 
launched its “easyJet Worldwide” platform, leveraging its 
network and schedule in Europe’s primary airports, offering 
connections with long-haul partners as well as a channel for 
third party partner sales. easyJet also has opportunities to 
build on its partnerships with industry-leading brands in car 
rental (Europcar) and hotels (Booking.com) and is exploring 
other value channels. Building on these, easyJet has a number 
of projects in the pipeline for the next 12 months.
The integration of technological platforms will enable easyJet 
to add products more easily across the value chain and offer 
them to customers in dynamic and compelling ways. In May 
easyJet launched its hands free bag proposition which has sold 
over 420,000 bags by the end of the financial year. Further 
products such as pre-order meals, entertainment and car 
parking will be integrated over the course of 2018.
THE BEST PEOPLE 
easyJet cares about its people and believes they set the airline 
apart. easyJet’s customer-facing employees are the very best 
in the industry and contribute significantly to the positive 
experience that passengers enjoy, leading to increased loyalty 
and repeat business.
easyJet continues to recruit to support its growth, adding over 
531 pilots and 1,846 cabin crew during the 2017 financial year. 
36% of positions were filled by internal candidates, ahead of 
easyJet’s target of 30%. Retention rates remain good with 
total employee turnover at 7%, while flight deck turnover was 
less than 4%. 
Since 2015, particularly through its Amy Johnson initiative, 
easyJet has been seeking to encourage more women to 
become pilots, to help address the significant gender 
imbalance in the world-wide pilot community. easyJet met its 
initial target to increase the proportion of new entrant pilots 
who are female to 12% in 2016, a year ahead of schedule. 
easyJet’s current target is for 20% of new entrant pilots who 
are female by 2020.
This year easyJet has invested in its ‘Next Generation’ 
programme, that is focused on driving efficiency and 
effectiveness in the overhead structure. By optimising a 
scaleable organisational design, focusing on accountabilities 
and empowerment, it will enhance ways of working that will 
support more effective and cost-efficient growth as well as 
more agile decision making that best fits easyJet’s 
entrepreneurial culture. The programme will be completed  
in the 2018 financial year.  16 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017
CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND FLEET
easyJet has a ruthless focus on capital allocation, using its 
market-leading fleet flexibility to increase or decrease capacity 
deployed. easyJet regularly reviews the opportunities available 
and prevailing economic and market conditions to determine 
the most effective capital allocation. Every year the airline 
churns routes that have not reached their targeted objectives 
using the flexibility to move aircraft between routes and 
markets to ensure improved utilisation and generate 
increased returns. 
In the past five years easyJet has closed bases in Madrid and 
Rome and redeployed those aircraft to secure stronger more 
profitable market positions elsewhere. Likewise this year 
easyJet announced the closure of its Hamburg base which will 
take place in March 2018. 
easyJet is able to support this with industry-leading fleet 
flexibility, through the timing and scale of capacity deployment: 
new aircraft orders can be deferred, leases may be extended 
or returned to the lessor, aircraft may be sold or utilisation can 
be reduced at times of low demand. This year easyJet 
secured, with Airbus, a reduced notice period for deferring 
deliveries from 24 months to 18 months, giving it a competitive 
advantage in its ability to respond to market conditions. 
In addition, easyJet has reached an agreement with Airbus to 
purchase 30 A321neo aircraft in a 235-seat configuration, with 
the first deliveries expected in July 2018. This is a conversion  
of 30 A320neo orders under the existing 2013 easyJet Airbus 
agreement. This will enable easyJet to continue to deliver 
growth in slot-constrained airports, as well as securing 
substantial unit cost savings, which are estimated to be  
around 8% to 9% better than a 186-seat A320neo.
easyJet’s total fleet as at 30 September 2017 comprised  
279 aircraft (2016: 257 aircraft), split between 156-seat Airbus 
A319s, 180-seat A320s, 186-seat A320s and, since June 2017, 
186-seat A320neos. Alongside its lean initiatives over the next 
five years easyJet will reduce cost per seat by improving the 
fleet mix. In the 2017 financial year, easyJet took delivery of 23 
aircraft, including 21 186-seat A320s and its first two A320neos. 
The A320neo provides a total per seat cost saving of 11% to 
13% compared to the A319 through economies of scale, 
efficiencies in crew, ownership, fuel and maintenance. easyJet 
also completed the up-gauging of 49 of its existing 180-seat 
A320s to 186 seats and is expecting to complete the 
remainder of the fleet in Winter 2018/9.
The average age of the fleet increased to 7.1 years (2016: 6.9 
years) and the average number of seats per aircraft increased 
to 169 seats. During the year, easyJet maintained its asset 
utilisation across the network at an average 10.9 block hours 
per day (2016: 10.9 hours).
easyJet continues to have a strong balance sheet, with net 
cash of £357 million at 30 September 2017. This is partly as a 
result of its procurement review of supplier terms, particularly 
with its fuel suppliers, as well as cash received in advance from 
the growing customer base. Of the 207 aircraft on easyJet’s 
balance sheet at 30 September 2017, 202 (98%) are 
unencumbered. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have both 
recently reaffirmed their industry leading ratings of BBB+ and 
Baa1 respectively.
Based on current plans
 
including the recently agreed changes 
to include A321neo aircraft, capital expenditure for the next 
three years is as follows:
Year 2017 2018 2019 2020
Gross capital 
expenditure (£million) 630 1,200 900 1,000
easyJet continues to look for ways of optimising the efficiency 
of the balance sheet, including the management of the 
liquidity position, which is currently set at a minimum of  
£2.6 million per 100 seats. To support the liquidity position, a 
policy has been written with Munich Re to provide £150 million 
of business interruption insurance to cover large short-term 
shock events, with a limited number of exclusions. Pricing is 
competitive with other sources of funding and frees up cash 
for use in the business.
Hedging positions
easyJet operates under a clear set of treasury policies 
agreed by the Board. The aim of easyJet’s hedging policy is 
to reduce short-term earnings volatility. Therefore, easyJet 
hedges forward, on a rolling basis, between 65% and 85% of 
the next 12 months anticipated fuel and currency exposures 
and between 45% and 65% of the following 12 months 
anticipated requirements. Specific decisions may require 
consideration of a longer-term approach. Treasury strategies 
and actions will be driven by the need to meet treasury, 
financial and corporate objectives.
BREXIT PLANS AND SHARE OWNERSHIP 
In July easyJet announced that it had established a new airline, 
easyJet Europe, which is headquartered in Vienna and will 
enable easyJet to continue to operate flights both across

STRATEGIC REPORT
Europe and domestically within European countries after the 
UK has left the EU (regardless of the outcome of talks on a 
future UK-EU aviation agreement). The new structure means 
that easyJet will become a pan-European airline group with 
three airlines based in the UK, Switzerland and Austria. All of 
these will be owned by easyJet plc which itself will be EU 
owned and controlled, listed on the London Stock Exchange 
and based in the UK.
It is a requirement of EU law that an EU member state may 
only permit an air carrier to operate airline services if the 
majority of its share capital is owned and the carrier is 
effectively controlled by member states of the EEA or their 
nationals. Therefore easyJet will propose changes to its 
Articles of Association, to be put to shareholders at its Annual 
General Meeting in February 2018, that will ensure easyJet plc 
is able to remain EU owned and controlled at all times after the 
UK has left the EU as required under EU law.
easyJet’s Articles of Association already contain existing 
provisions to give the Directors powers to limit the ownership of 
the Company’s shares by non-UK nationals and a number of 
powers to enforce this limitation. easyJet intends to amend these 
provisions, pending shareholder approval, such that they apply to 
non-EU holders of easyJet shares (which will exclude UK holders 
once the UK has left the EU). It is currently anticipated that the 
permitted maximum in respect of non-EU holders of easyJet 
shares following this change will be set at slightly less than 50%. 
Full details of the proposed changes to the articles of association 
will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting to be 
posted to shareholders in January 2018.
easyJet begins from a position of strength, with close to  
50% of its shares already held in the hands of EEA nationals 
(excluding UK-only nationals) and the Company has already 
begun a more rigorous investor relations programme across 
Europe with the intention of increasing EEA (non-UK) 
ownership above 50% prior to the UK’s exit from the EU. As 
such, easyJet has no current intention of using these proposed 
powers, in respect of non-EU holders of easyJet shares but 
considers these changes an important step in ensuring that 
easyJet plc has the ability to maintain EU ownership and 
control at all times should it need to do so and thus secure  
its future operations in Europe for the long-term.
easyJet is working with the UK government, EU institutions and 
their member states to ensure that flying rights between the 
UK and the EU are maintained.
AIR BERLIN ACQUISITION
In October easyJet announced an agreement to acquire part of 
Air Berlin’s operations at Berlin Tegel airport for a purchase 
consideration of €40 million, subject to antitrust and regulatory 
approvals. The acquisition, which is expected to close in 
December 2017, will result in easyJet entering into leases for up to 
25 A320 aircraft, offering employment to up to 1,000 former Air 
Berlin crews and taking over other assets including slots. The 
purchase price excludes start-up and transitional operating costs.
This agreement is consistent with easyJet’s strategy of 
purposeful investment in strong number one positions in 
Europe’s leading airports (or number two to a legacy 
incumbent). This will enable easyJet to operate the leading 
short-haul network at Tegel connecting passengers to and 
from destinations across Germany and the rest of Europe. 
This is in addition to easyJet’s existing base at Berlin 
Schönefeld and would mean that easyJet would be the 
leading airline in Berlin.
Based on current assumptions, easyJet expects to incur 
headline losses of around £60 million on its activities at Tegel 
in the 2018 financial year, as it starts up operations in January 
2018 using wet lease aircraft with initially lower loads and 
yields. In addition, one-off non-headline costs associated with 
the transaction are expected in the 2018 financial year of 
around £100 million. These costs represent the parallel ramp 
up of a dry lease operation, including fleet conversion and staff 
recruitment and training costs, as well as transaction costs. 
The transaction is expected to be earnings accretive by the 
2019 financial year.
OUTLOOK 
easyJet continues to see the current market environment  
as an opportunity to build and strengthen its network and 
customer proposition for the long-term. 
easyJet plans to grow capacity by around 6% for the 2018 
financial year, excluding Air Berlin capacity. Forward bookings 
are ahead of last year at 88% for the first quarter and 26% for 
the second quarter.
Revenue trends in the first quarter have been encouraging, 
primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market. 
Revenue per seat growth at constant currency in the first 
quarter is now expected to be positive by low to mid-single 
digits and reflects a degree of short term benefit as well as 
underlying improvement. Revenue per seat growth at constant 
currency in the first half is also currently expected to be positive 
by low to mid-single digits reflecting the move of Easter from 
the third quarter, excluding the impact of Air Berlin which will be 
disclosed separately throughout the 2018 financial year. Visibility 
for the second half of the financial year is very limited.
Total headline cost per seat is expected to decrease by around 
2% during the 12 months to 30 September 2018, excluding the 
impact of Air Berlin costs. Headline cost per seat, excluding 
fuel and at constant currency, is expected to increase by up to 
1% due to underlying crew and ground handling cost inflation, 
and excludes the impact of Air Berlin. 
Based on today’s fuel prices
(6)
 unit fuel costs for the year to  
30 September 2018 are expected to benefit easyJet by 
between £100 million and £125 million as a result of easyJet’s 
advantaged hedging position.
The total expected headline foreign exchange
(7)
 impact for the 
year to 30 September 2018, is expected to be a headwind of 
around £5 million.
easyJet’s policy of paying its dividend from headline profit 
after tax is expected to deliver dividend growth in the 2018 
financial year.
CAROLYN MCCALL DBE
Chief Executive
(6) Unit fuel is calculated as the difference between latest estimate of the 2018 financial year fuel costs less the 2017 financial year fuel costs per seat, 
multiplied by the 2018 financial year seat capacity. Based on fuel spot price range of $580-$650.
(7) US dollar to £ Sterling 1.32, Euro to £ Sterling 1.12, Swiss Franc to £ Sterling 1.31. Currency, capital expenditure and fuel increases are shown net of hedging 
impact.
On a personal note, this will be my final set of results as 
CEO and I would like to thank all of easyJet’s people who 
have contributed so much to easyJet’s success story, 
and I wish them all the very best for the future. 18 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017
GDP
GDP is an established driver that is generally accepted as having a positive 
multiplier effect on air passenger traffic. 
Economic trends remain favourable, with positive GDP expected in all of 
easyJet’s European base markets in 2018.
Chief Executive’s review / continued
Our markets
easyJet operates in the European short-haul aviation market.  
The following trends are key drivers in that market: 
GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS
The aviation industry has been affected by a number of geopolitical events in recent years which have had both short-term 
and long-term consequences for demand and the structure of the industry.
UK DECISION TO LEAVE EU
easyJet has been a major beneficiary of the European Union, in particular the Open Skies regulation. Following the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU in June 2016 easyJet has taken steps to protect its operations in the future, including the 
establishment of an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) in Austria.
TERROR ATTACKS IN THE EU
Major European cities have been subject to a number of terrorist attacks including easyJet’s key bases of Paris, London, 
Nice and Berlin. These all had an immediate impact on consumer demand, which reversed over time.
FOREIGN 
EXCHANGE
easyJet is exposed to foreign 
exchange rate movements, 
principally Sterling against the US 
dollar and the Euro, which it hedges 
to mitigate volatility.
Since the UK referendum vote to 
leave the European Union Sterling 
has significantly fallen in value 
against both currencies, which  
has had an ongoing negative 
impact on profit. A strong US dollar 
increases the price of fuel, 
easyJet’s biggest cost; a strong 
Euro typically has a net benefit for 
easyJet’s European operations.
The weakening of Sterling has seen 
an adverse headline impact of 
£101m in FY17.

Financial review
Our financial results
Seats flown grew by 8.5%. Total revenue per seat fell by  
0.4% to £58.23, a decrease of 4.5% at constant currency.  
The decrease is a consequence of the persisting low fuel price 
environment, resulting in high levels of capacity growth and a 
competitive pricing environment which saw yields fall by 7.3% 
at constant currency. Partially offsetting these impacts was 
growth in ancillary revenue which grew by 8.6% to £11.38 per 
seat, as initiatives and high load factors offset ticket  
pricing pressures.
Headline cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 7.7% to 
£41.27 and increased by 0.9% at constant currency. This 
increase is mainly due to continued inflationary pressures in the 
market, particularly at regulated airports, and higher disruption 
costs as a result of a greater level of EU 261 compensation 
claims and an increase in welfare costs driven by significant 
industrial strike action and adverse weather conditions. 
Disruption increased the cost per seat by £0.34 at constant 
currency. These were combined with an increase in aircraft 
lease costs due to rent associated with the 10 aircraft sale and 
leasebacks in the year, increase in depreciation due to the 
acquisition of new aircraft both last year and this year, increase 
in wet lease charges due to three aircraft being wet leased  
in the year to build peak season resilience and increase in net 
interest costs which is attributable to the financing costs of  
the two bonds. These were partially offset by the impact of 
the annualisation of reduced navigation charges, savings 
obtained from airport lean initiatives, engineering and 
maintenance savings such as the component supply contract 
and the up-gauging of fleet as easyJet continues to move 
from A319s to A320s.
Fuel costs fell by £52 million, and from £13.95 to £12.25 per 
seat. Despite an increase in the market price of fuel, the

In the 2017 financial year, easyJet flew  
80.2 million passengers (2016: 73.1 million)  
and delivered a headline profit before tax 
for the year of £408 million (£4.71 per seat),  
a decrease of £86 million from a restated 
headline profit before tax of £494 million 
(restated profit of £6.18 per seat) last year. The 
2017 result includes a £101 million unfavourable 
movement from foreign exchange. At constant 
currency, easyJet delivered a headline profit 
before tax of £509 million during the year.

operation of easyJet’s hedging policy resulted in a reduction  
in the effective fuel price.
Headline profit before tax per seat decreased by 23.8% to 
£4.71 per seat (2016 (restated): £6.18). 
Non-headline costs of £23 million were recognised in the 
period, consisting of a £16 million charge as a result of the 
sale and leaseback of 10 A319 aircraft in December, a £6 million 
charge associated with our organisational review, a £2 million 
charge in relation to the set-up of an EU Air Operator 
Certificate (AOC), a £1 million charge for fair value adjustments 
associated with the bond issued in February 2016 and a  
£2 million gain for balance sheet revaluations.
Total costs increased by £500 million to £4,662 million, and  
by £1.67 to £53.78 per seat (2016 (restated): £52.11).
The tax charge for the year was £80 million. The effective 
tax rate for the period was 20.8% (2016 (restated): 13.8%), 
higher than the standard UK rate of 19%, due to the Swiss 
income being taxed at a higher rate combined with the impact 
of prior year adjustments.
Total profit after tax decreased from £437 million to £305 million.
Due to a change in accounting policy, to recognise the initial 
maintenance provision catch up on sale and leasebacks 
immediately in the income statement, a change was required 
as a restatement of previous financial statements. Please refer 
to note 1 of the accounts for full details. During the year the 
presentation of the results in the income statement was also 
changed to include a measure of profit described as ‘headline’ 
to be used by the Directors to measure and monitor underlying 
trading performance. The excluded items are referred to as 
‘non-headline’ items. Please refer to the non-headline items 
section on page 29 for further details. 27 www.easyJet.com

Diluted headline earnings per share 81.9 107.6 (25.7) 
Proposed ordinary dividend 40.9 53.8 (12.9)
Basic total earnings per share decreased by 30.2% to 77.4p (2016 (restated): 110.9p). Basic headline earnings per share decreased 
by 23.9% to 82.5p (2016 (restated): 108.4p) as a consequence of the £102 million decrease in the headline profit after tax.
In line with the stated dividend policy of a pay-out ratio of 50% of headline profit after tax, the Board is recommending an 
ordinary dividend of £162 million or 40.9 pence per share which is subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting on 8 February 2018. This will be paid on 23 March 2018 to shareholders on the register at close of business 
on 2 March 2018.

(restated) Change
Headline ROCE 11.9% 15.0% (3.1ppt)
Total ROCE 11.3% 15.2% (3.9ppt) 
Headline ROCE for the year was 11.9%, a decline of 3.1 percentage points on the restated prior year. The decrease in ROCE was 
due to the decrease in headline profit for the year and a 11.1% increase in the average adjusted capital employed including lease 
adjustments, primarily due to the acquisition of 23 aircraft during the year. The ROCE calculation excludes borrowings, cash 
and money market deposits and includes an adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements. The 
adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual charge for aircraft dry leasing by a factor of seven.

Revenue per seat decreased by 0.4% to £58.23 (2016: £58.46), a decrease of 4.5% to £55.83 at constant currency. The decrease 
is a consequence of the persisting low fuel price environment, resulting in high levels of capacity growth and a competitive 
pricing environment which saw yields fall by 7.3% at constant currency. Partially offsetting these impacts was growth in ancillary 
revenue which grew by 8.6% to £11.38 per seat, as initiatives and high load factors offset ticket pricing pressures.
Average load factor for the year increased by one percentage point to 92.6%. 
Revenue per ASK decreased by 1.0%, or by 5.1% at constant currency, impacted by a 0.4% decrease in revenue per seat, and  
a 0.6% increase in the average sector length.
easyJet currently categorises total revenue earned on the face of the income statement between seat and non-seat revenue. 
From 1 October 2017, total revenue will be categorised between passenger and ancillary revenue. This change provides greater 
transparency of the ancillary element of revenue and brings easyJet in line with other airlines. Under the new presentation, total 
revenue would have been categorised as follows:

Headline airports and ground handling cost per seat increased by 6.5% but decreased by 1.3% at constant currency. Savings 
obtained from airport lean initiatives have offset regulatory airport uplifts.
Headline crew cost per seat increased by 9.7% to £7.44, and by 4.2% at constant currency. This reflects pay increases, increased 
disruption and additional investment into operational resilience over the summer peak period, given the level of airport and 
airspace congestion. However, these were largely offset by efficiencies obtained from the up-gauging of our fleet and savings 
from lean initiatives.
Headline navigation cost per seat increased by 4.4% to £4.40 but decreased by 4.0% at constant currency driven by the 
annualisation of reduced charges, primarily in France and Germany.
Headline maintenance cost per seat increased by 0.7% to £3.09, but decreased by 7.2% at constant currency. This was driven by 
engineering and maintenance savings, such as the component supply contract, and the up-gauging of fleet as easyJet continues 
to move from A319s to A320s.  29 www.easyJet.com
STRATEGIC REPORT
Headline other operating costs per seat increased by 16.1% to £4.28 per seat, and by 12.2% at constant currency. This was mainly 
driven by an increase in disruption costs due to a greater level of EU 261 compensation claims and an increase in welfare costs 
driven by significant industrial strike action and adverse weather conditions. This was combined with an increase in wet lease 
charges due to three aircraft being wet leased over the summer to aid operational resilience.
Headline aircraft dry leasing cost per seat increased by 11.2% to £1.27 but decreased by 0.8% at constant currency. The 
favourable variance was driven by the return of four leased aircraft last year and one aircraft this year. These more than offset 
the increase from the rent associated with the 10 aircraft sale and leasebacks that occurred earlier in the year. The average 
number of leased aircraft increased by 9.6% to 70.
Depreciation costs have increased by 5.8% on a per seat basis driven by the acquisition of 20 new aircraft last year and  
23 aircraft this year, which more than offset the decrease from the 10 aircraft sale and leasebacks and the impact of increased 
capacity. The average number of owned aircraft increased by 6.9% to 197.
An increase in headline net interest costs of £0.11 per seat is attributable to the financing costs of the two bonds, as we invest  
in the long-term growth of the airline.

During the period the average market jet fuel price increased by 20.7% to $501 per tonne from $415 per tonne in the previous 
year. The operation of easyJet’s hedging policy meant that the average effective fuel price movement saw a decrease of 14.0% 
to £412 per tonne from £479 per tonne in the previous year.

Net cash at 30 September 2017 was £357 million (2016: £213 million) and comprised cash (excluding restricted cash) and money 
market deposits of £1,328 million (2016: £969 million) and borrowings of £971 million (2016: £756 million). After allowing for the 
impact of aircraft operating leases (seven times operating lease costs incurred in the year), adjusted net debt decreased by  
£11 million to £413 million.
Net capital expenditure includes the acquisition of 23 A320 aircraft (2016: 20 aircraft), the purchase of life-limited parts used  
in engine restoration and pre-delivery payments relating to aircraft purchases. The number of scheduled aircraft operating in  
the fleet increased from 249 at 30 September 2016 to 270 at 30 September 2017.
Borrowings as at 30 September 2017 were £971 million, an increase of £215 million from 30 September 2016. Under the  
£3 billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme announced in early 2016, easyJet plc issued notes in October 2016 amounting  
to €500 million for a seven-year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.125%. This increase in borrowings was partially offset  
by the repayment of mortgages on aircraft amounting to £220 million in the period.

STRATEGIC REPORT
GOING CONCERN
easyJet’s business activities, together with factors likely 
to affect its future development and performance, are 
described in the Strategic report on pages 2 to 46. Principal 
risks and uncertainties are described on pages 33 to 40. 
Note 23 to the accounts sets out the Group’s objectives, 
policies and procedures for managing its capital and gives 
details of the risks related to financial instruments held by 
the Group.
At 30 September 2017, the Group held cash and cash 
equivalents of £711 million and money market deposits of 
£617 million. Total debt of £971 million is free from financial 
covenants, with £8 million due for repayment in the year 
to 30 September 2018.
Net current assets at 30 September 2017 were £64 million 
and included unearned revenue (payments made by 
customers for flights scheduled post year end) of 
£727 million.
The business is exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices and 
US dollar and Euro exchange rates. The Group’s policy is 
to hedge between 65% and 85% of estimated exposures 
12 months in advance, and between 45% and 65% of 
estimated exposures from 13 up to 24 months in advance. 
Specific decisions may require consideration of a longer-
term approach. Treasury strategies and actions will be 
driven by the need to meet treasury, financial and corporate 
objectives. The Group was compliant with this policy at 
the date of this Annual report and accounts.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group will be able 
to operate within the level of available facilities and cash 
and deposits for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Annual report and accounts.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have assessed easyJet’s viability over a 
three-year period to September 2020. This is based on a 
three year strategic plan, which gives greater certainty over 
the forecasting assumptions used.
In making their assessment, the Directors took account of 
easyJet’s current financial and operational positions and 
contracted capital expenditure. They also assessed the 
potential financial and operational impacts of the principal 
risks and uncertainties set out on pages 33 to 40 in severe 
but plausible scenarios, including the impact of a sustained 
significant adverse movement in foreign currency exchange 
rates or jet fuel prices and the likely degree of effectiveness 
of current and available mitigating actions. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet all liabilities as they fall 
due up to September 2020.
In making this statement, the Directors have also made the 
following key assumptions:
• funding for capital expenditure in the form of capital 
markets debt, bank debt or aircraft leases will be 
available in all plausible market conditions;
• there will not be a prolonged grounding of a substantial 
portion of the fleet; and
• the terms on which the United Kingdom leaves the EU 
are such that easyJet will be able to continue to operate 
over broadly the same network as at present.
ANDREW FINDLAY
Chief Financial Officer
Net assets increased by £108 million, due to the profit generated in the period and favourable movements on the hedging 
reserve, which were partially offset by the payment of the ordinary dividend. The movement on the hedging reserve was 
predominantly due to the favourable mark-to-market movement on both jet fuel and US dollar forward contracts.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment increased by £273 million, driven principally by the acquisition of 23 A320 
family aircraft, and pre-delivery payments relating to aircraft purchases. 32 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk
Risk management framework
easyJet is exposed to a variety of risks which are driven by both internal 
and external factors. These risks have an effect on the performance and 
achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. The Board is responsible 
for risk management and ensuring appropriate mitigating actions are 
being taken to manage risks effectively. 
RISK APPETITE
The risk appetite is the level of risk considered appropriate to 
accept in achieving easyJet’s strategic objectives. The 
appropriateness of the mitigating actions is determined in 
accordance with the Board’s approved risk appetite for the 
relevant area. The risk appetite is reviewed and validated by 
the Board on an annual basis.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
• The risk management function is coordinated by the Risk 
and Assurance Team which reports to the Chief Financial 
Officer, as well as having a direct line to the Chair of the 
Audit Committee. The key elements of the process are:
 – The risk management process begins with the 
identification of significant risks by each function.
 – Risks are assessed taking into account the potential 
impact and likelihood of the risks occurring and the key 
mitigations identified. The current level of risk is 
compared to the Board’s risk appetite to determine 
whether further mitigations are required. Risks specific 
to a function’s activities are managed within the 
function on an ongoing basis with regular follow-up by 
the risk team.
 – The most significant risks from each function (based  
on materiality, cross functional impact and/or those 
which have common themes across the business) are 
reviewed and prioritised by the Risk Evaluation Group, 
which consists of members of senior management from 
each function. This group’s role is to debate, agree and 
prioritise the principal risks. 
 – These risks, which form the basis of the principal risks 
and uncertainties detailed in this section, are challenged 
and validated by the Executive Management Team  
and the Board. Principal risks are being monitored 
throughout the year, with material changes being 
presented to the Board as they arise, and updates 
presented at least quarterly.
 – In addition to supporting the Board, the risk team 
supports the business in its management of risks 
relating to key projects and programmes, specific 
business risks, third parties, countries and bases.

The risks and uncertainties described below are considered, 
at this point in time, to have the greatest effect on easyJet’s 
strategic objectives. This categorised list is not intended to be 
exhaustive, and the ordering of the risks is not an indication of 
exposure. Whilst easyJet can monitor risks and prepare for 
adverse scenarios, the ability to affect the core drivers of many 
risks is not within the Group’s control, for example adverse 
weather, pandemics, acts of terrorism, changes in government 
regulation and macroeconomic issues. 
Risk description Mitigation
MAJOR SAFETY INCIDENT
A major safety incident (such as a hull 
loss) could adversely affect easyJet’s 
reputation and its operational and 
financial performance. The impact of 
such an incident would be heightened if 
easyJet failed to react promptly and deal 
with it effectively.
Link to strategy:
 easyJet’s number one priority is the safety and security of its customers and people. 
A Safety Committee (a committee of the Board) provides oversight of the 
management of easyJet’s safety processes and systems.
 Turn to page: 57 for further details
A Safety Review Board (at Executive Management Team level) is responsible for 
directing overall safety policy and governance. This is chaired by the Chief Executive.
Safety Action Groups from across the airline are responsible for the identification, 
evaluation and control of safety-related risks.
easyJet operates a Safety Management System using a leading software system 
(SafetyNet). This is used to:
• collect and analyse safety data (enabling potential areas of risk to be  
projected); and
• enable learning from easyJet and industry events/incidents to be captured  
and embedded into future risk mitigations.
A robust incident reporting process and ‘Just Culture’ are in place.
easyJet has an emergency response process and performs regular crisis 
management exercises.

SECURITY THREAT OR ATTACK
Failure to identify or prevent a major 
security-related threat or attack, or 
react immediately and effectively, 
could adversely affect easyJet’s 
reputation and its operational and 
financial performance. 
Such an incident has the potential 
to impact upon easyJet’s business, 
regardless of the location or target.
The threat of further security-related 
attacks (regardless of where they may 
occur) may impact the future demand 
for air travel.
Link to strategy:
 A Security Decision Group, comprising the Chairman of the plc Board, Chief 
Executive, appropriate members of the Executive Management Team and other 
senior management, determines whether easyJet should continue to operate in 
countries or areas affected by security-related incidents or conflict. As part of that 
process the easyJet security team works to provide the Security Decision Group with 
the most timely, credible and reliable information upon which to base operational 
decisions. easyJet adheres to all recommendations and guidelines provided by  
the authorities.
The Director of Safety and Security and the Head of Security work with authorities 
and governments around easyJet’s network to assess whether security measures are 
effective and in compliance with regulatory requirements. A significant amount of 
work is carried out with the aim of enhancing:
• early identification of developing and emerging security risks; 
• the active management of security risks; 
• the methods for reducing the impact of any security-related incident; and
• the Group’s security culture and awareness.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk description Mitigation
COMPETITION, CAPACITY AND 
INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION
The aviation market is highly competitive 
and easyJet operates in competition 
with both flag carriers and other 
low-cost airlines.
Excess capacity in the market may 
arise due to a decrease in demand for 
air travel and/or additional capacity as a 
result of low fuel prices. This could have 
an adverse financial impact.
easyJet’s key competitive advantages 
include its network, cost base, brand, 
digital innovation and efficient and 
robust capital structure. Failure to 
retain these advantages or react quickly 
to competitor changes could have an 
adverse financial impact.
Industry consolidation could also affect 
the competitive environment in a 
number of markets. This could cause 
a loss of market position and erosion 
of revenue.
Link to strategy:
 easyJet seeks to have a rapid response to any such activity that may impact 
easyJet’s ability to grow the business. 
Competitor and consolidation activity is monitored, enabling strategic decision 
making on key routes/positions.
The Network Development Forum, a cross-functional panel of senior executives, 
approves new bases and the allocation of assets around the network.
Fleet framework arrangements, together with the Group’s leasing policy, 
provide easyJet with significant flexibility in respect of scaling the fleet according 
to business requirements.
Strong cost control is a key behaviour across the Company, with initiatives to drive 
cost reduction and improve efficiency in targeted areas.
easyJet is developing commercial and digital enhancements that will improve 
commercial options and enable more rapid changes, thereby conserving as well  
as increasing its commercial capabilities.
Following the announcement in October that easyJet will purchase parts of  
Air Berlin, subject to anti-trust and regulatory approvals, there is now an additional 
programme risk relating to the integration of Air Berlin operations.
   
SIGNIFICANT NETWORK 
DISRUPTION
Widespread disruption to easyJet’s 
network may be caused by a single 
event or factors which occur for a 
sustained period. Examples include 
forces of nature (extreme weather, 
volcanic ash, etc.), terrorism,  
air traffic management issues, 
epidemics/pandemics or the  
closure of a key airport. 
Significant disruption to the network 
could adversely affect easyJet’s 
reputation and its operational and 
financial performance including the 
payment of EU 261 claims.
Link to strategy:
 There are processes in place, and clear roles and responsibilities within teams across 
the business, to plan for and manage significant disruption.
A business disruption team, which includes senior management from relevant 
business areas, determines and initiates required action.
Board policy is to maintain a liquidity buffer which allows the Group to better 
manage the impact of downturns in business or temporary curtailment of activities.
In addition, easyJet holds business disruption insurance which provides some cover 
for some of these very significant shock events such as extreme weather, air traffic 
management issues and loss of access to key airports.

Risk description Mitigation
CONTINUITY OF SERVICES
easyJet is dependent on a number of 
key IT systems and processes.
A loss of critical systems or access to 
facilities, including the website, may lead 
to significant disruption to operations 
and could have an adverse reputational 
and financial impact.
Link to strategy:
Critical systems are hosted either across two data centres, or at third-party provider 
locations. Recovery arrangements, including failover between the two data centres, 
are in place for all locations holding critical systems.
An IT incident management team is in place to respond rapidly to any unforeseen 
incidents that may arise.
IT disaster recovery plans are tested regularly to identify opportunities for 
improved resilience.
Business continuity plans ensure easyJet is prepared in the event of loss of facilities, 
including alternative sites for the relocation of critical staff.
THIRD PARTY SERVICE 
PROVIDERS
easyJet has entered into agreements 
with third party service providers for 
services covering a significant proportion 
of its operational and cost base.
Failure to adequately manage third party 
performance may adversely affect 
easyJet’s reputation and its operational 
and financial performance.
Link to strategy:
There is a defined procurement process, led by a centralised procurement team, 
which ensures a competitive and robust selection of suppliers. As part of the 
process, alternative service providers are identified and assessed against a balanced 
evaluation criteria within the major markets in which easyJet operates.
Any specific supplier risks are identified and assessed during the procurement 
process and controls and risk mitigations are included in the contracts entered into 
with the supplier.
Contracts are managed according to easyJet’s supplier relationship management 
framework, with key principles covering defined ownership and accountability, a 
governance framework and effective communication. Supplier performance is 
monitored through regular business reviews, including achievement of service level 
agreements and key performance indicators.
Robust transition plans are agreed in the event of switching suppliers to enable  
an acceptable level of service to be maintained.
INDUSTRIAL ACTION
easyJet, and the aviation industry in 
general, has a significant number of 
employees who are members of trade 
unions. Industrial action taken by easyJet 
employees, or by the employees of key 
third party service providers, could 
impact on easyJet’s ability to maintain  
its flight schedules.
This could adversely affect easyJet’s 
reputation and its operational and 
financial performance.
Link to strategy:
As easyJet operates across Europe, its crew are members of 20 unions and  
11 representative bodies across eight countries. easyJet seeks to maintain positive 
working relationships with all trade unions and other representative bodies.
Each of the countries in which easyJet operates has localised employment terms 
and conditions. This mitigates the risk of large-scale internal industrial action 
occurring at the same time. 
Processes are in place to adapt to disruptions as a result of industrial action.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk description Mitigation
FINANCIAL RISK
easyJet is exposed to a variety of 
financial risks which could give rise to 
adverse pressure on the financial 
performance of the Group, e.g. 
costs, revenue and cash flow.
• Market risks – significant/sudden 
increases in jet fuel prices, currency 
fluctuations or interest rates which 
have not been adequately protected 
through hedging.
• Counterparty risk – non-performance 
of counterparties used for depositing 
surplus funds (e.g. money market 
funds, bank deposits) and hedging.
• Liquidity risk – misjudgment in the 
level of liquidity resulting in inability 
to meet contractual/contingent 
financial obligations or the inability 
to fund the business when needed.
Link to strategy:
 The Finance Committee (a committee of the Board) oversees the Group’s treasury 
and funding policies and activities.
 Turn to page: 63 for further details
This includes:
• maintaining a treasury policy setting out Board approved strategies for foreign 
exchange and fuel hedging, along with liquidity, interest rate management, 
counterparties’ limits; and
• reviewing and reporting on compliance with Board treasury policies.
The policy is to hedge revenue and costs within a percentage band for a rolling 
24-month period.
Board policy is to maintain a liquidity buffer including cash and a $500 million 
revolving credit facility provided by a group of 12 relationship banks. This allows  
the Group to better manage the impact of downturns in business or temporary 
curtailment of activities. The basis for the liquidity policy was revised in 2016.  
The policy is to maintain a minimum liquidity buffer at £2.6 million per 100 seats 
(previously £4 million per aircraft). 
A strong balance sheet supports the business through fluctuations in economic 
conditions and the Group has access to diverse sources of funding to support 
liquidity requirements.
Risk description Mitigation
SINGLE FLEET RISK
easyJet is dependent on Airbus as its 
sole supplier for aircraft.
There are significant cost and efficiency 
advantages of a single fleet, however 
there are two main associated risks: 
• technical or mechanical issues that 
could ground the full fleet, or part of 
the fleet, which could cause negative 
perception; and
• valuation risks which crystallise  
when aircraft exit the fleet. The  
main exposure at this time is with  
the ageing A319 fleet, where easyJet 
is reliant on the future demand for 
second-hand aircraft.
Link to strategy:
The Board considers that the efficiencies achieved by operating a single fleet type 
outweigh the risks associated with easyJet’s single fleet strategy. 
The Airbus A320 family (which includes the A319 and A321) is one of the two primary 
fleets used for short-haul travel, the other being the Boeing B737 family. There are 
approximately 7,400 A320 family aircraft operating with a proven track record for 
safety and reliability. 
The introduction of the A320neo during the year in part mitigates this risk as the 
aircraft is equipped with a different engine type.
easyJet operates a rigorous established aircraft maintenance programme. 
To mitigate the potential valuation risks, easyJet regularly reviews the second-hand 
market and has a number of different options when looking at fleet exit strategies. 
Sale and leaseback facilitates the exit of A319 aircraft from the fleet by transferring 
residual value risk, and also provides flexibility in managing the fleet size.

DELIVERY OF PROJECTS 
SUPPORTING THE BUSINESS 
STRATEGY
The business is undertaking a number of 
key projects and programmes to deliver 
key elements of the strategy.
Following the announcement in  
October that easyJet will purchase  
parts of Air Berlin, a large scale complex 
programme is underway to implement 
the Air Berlin operation.
Failure to deliver the planned 
business benefits and cost savings 
from these projects may result in under 
achievement of easyJet’s planned 
financial results.
Link to strategy:
 The easyJet Change Board meets monthly to review progress made on the portfolio 
of programmes and solve issues that require escalation.
Key IT projects or programmes have additional oversight through the IT Governance 
and Oversight Committee (a committee of the Board).
 
 Turn to page: 63 for further details
 Each project or programme has its own steering group which provides challenge 
to the project, monitors progress and ensures that decisions are made at the 
appropriate level.
A portfolio management office is in place to oversee delivery of projects and 
programmes, and track budgets and realisation of benefits.
A project management framework, which sets out the governance requirements, 
key processes and controls, is followed by all projects and programmes. Lessons 
learnt reviews are undertaken to ensure continuous improvement to this approach.

ATTRACTION AND RETENTION 
OF TALENT
easyJet’s current and future success is 
reliant on having the right people with 
the right capabilities.
Increased competition in the recruitment 
market may impact easyJet’s ability 
to attract and retain key talent. This 
could adversely affect the delivery of 
strategic objectives.
Link to strategy:
 There is a recruitment strategy for pilots and cabin crew. This includes pilot 
sponsorship and the Amy Johnston flying initiative to attract more female pilots. In 
addition, easyJet has developed a coherent employment brand to attract and retain 
top talent.
easyJet also this year opened recruitment for 14 engineering apprentices and sought 
to encourage more women to apply for these roles.
easyJet’s aim is to develop talent from within. There are several talent development 
programmes in place for individuals who have been identified for fast-tracking into 
more senior roles as vacancies arise.
Alongside this, there is an annual succession planning process to ensure there are 
clear successors for all key business roles.

COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY
Risk description Mitigation
IMPACT OF EU EXIT
The UK government is in the process 
of negotiating the UK’s exit from the 
European Union although details of the 
future relationship still remain uncertain. 
If easyJet is unable to continue to fly 
its UK-EU network this would have 
a significant operational and 
financial impact.
Link to strategy:
 easyJet has put in place in Austria a third AOC; easyJet Europe. This will ensure 
easyJet can retain its intra-EU flying rights. We continue to actively engage with the 
European Commission, EU Member States and the UK government to ensure that 
there is an EU/UK agreement in place to maintain flying rights between the UK and 
the EU.
An internal working group has been established to manage all aspects of easyJet’s 
operations and structure with relation to the EU exit and the implementation of the 
third AOC.
LEGISLATIVE AND 
REGULATORY RISKS
The airline industry is heavily regulated 
and there is a continual need to keep 
well informed and adapt to (as required) 
any legislative or regulatory changes 
across the jurisdictions in which 
easyJet operates.
Failure to comply with legislative 
and regulatory requirements 
(or interpretations thereof), such as 
local consumer laws, legal decisions or 
policy changes in relation to passenger 
compensation, environmental and airport 
regulation, in the jurisdictions in which 
easyJet operates, could have an adverse 
reputational and financial impact.
Link to strategy:
 easyJet has an in-house legal and compliance team to advise on legal issues and 
developments, and to monitor compliance with formal regulatory requirements. It 
also has a panel of external legal advisers, both in the UK and in key easyJet markets, 
who are briefed to keep easyJet informed of any changes or new legislation and to 
assist easyJet in developing appropriate responses to such legislation.
The Regulatory Affairs Group co-ordinates easyJet’s role in influencing future and 
existing policy and regulations which affect the airline industry and will work with 
industry bodies to assist in this, as appropriate. 
Country Review Boards are established for easyJet’s main markets, raising awareness 
of in-country issues, and providing a forum in which to highlight any potential 
legislative changes and impacts in the different countries.

MAJOR SHAREHOLDER AND 
BRAND OWNER RELATIONSHIP
easyJet has two major shareholders 
(easyGroup Holdings Limited and 
Polys Holding Limited) which, as a 
concert party, control approximately 
33% of its ordinary shares. 
Shareholder activism on their part 
could adversely impact the reputation 
of easyJet and cause a distraction 
to management.
Regulations surrounding easyJet’s share 
ownership and control may be affected 
by the outcome of negotiations relating 
to Britain’s exit from the EU. 
easyJet does not own its company 
name or branding, which is licensed from 
easyGroup Ltd. The licence includes 
certain minimum service levels that 
easyJet must meet in order to retain the 
right to use the name and brand. The 
easyJet brand could also be impacted 
through the actions of easyGroup 
or other easyGroup licensees.
Link to strategy:
 easyJet has an active shareholder engagement programme led by its investor 
relations team. As part of that programme easyJet engages with easyGroup 
Holdings Limited on a regular basis alongside its other major shareholders. 
In addition, the Company has a relationship agreement with easyGroup and  
Polys Holdings in line with the controlling shareholder regime as set out in the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules. 
Representatives from the Board and senior management take collective 
responsibility for addressing issues arising from any activist approach adopted by the 
major shareholder. The objective is to address issues when they arise and anticipate 
and plan for potential future activism.
easyJet has a number of initiatives in place to ensure that its shares are held by 
relevant shareholders in order to comply with European Union regulations. easyJet’s 
current ownership by EU-relevant, non-UK shareholders is close to 50%.
The brand licence agreement with easyGroup Ltd provides for the regular meeting  
of senior representatives from both sides, attended by the Chief Financial Officer 
and General Counsel, to actively manage brand-related issues as they arise. Such 
meetings occur on a quarterly basis and have proven effective. easyJet also 
monitors compliance with brand licence service levels and has a right to take steps 
to remedy any instance of non-compliance.
CYBER THREAT AND 
INFORMATION SECURITY
easyJet faces both external cyber 
threats and internal risks to its data  
and systems.
A security breach may have an  
adverse customer, operational or 
financial impact which adversely  
affects easyJet’s reputation.
Link to strategy:
 An Information Security Steering Group, chaired by the General Counsel, oversees 
any developments in data threats and controls, and determines whether actions 
taken in response are appropriate. 
There are dedicated information security teams that monitor threats and ensure that 
the design, implementation and operation of easyJet systems are secure. This is 
through the following: 
• achieving secure by design through a dedicated security architecture capability; 
• monitoring of secure systems for unauthorised access;
• reviewing the security of external and internal systems, including easyJet.com, 
through periodic vulnerability scanning;
• considering information security risks within procurement processes and the 
introduction of new systems and IT services;
• ensuring payment card security with data encryption and a dedicated team 
to monitor and control access;
• reviewing and refreshing information acceptable use policies; and
• maintaining staff security awareness and education through a 
Security Champions network, on-line training materials and periodic 
awareness campaigns.
Given the nature of this risk, the appropriateness of mitigation activity is continuously 
reviewed under the governance of an information security programme. This 
programme is subject to independent programme assurance on an at least  
annual basis.

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
Customers should be confident that they can travel where 
they want to go safely. easyJet’s employees and suppliers 
should be able to work in a safe environment.
SAFETY MANAGEMENT
Safety is easyJet’s highest priority. It is committed to 
providing a safe journey for its passengers and a safe working 
environment for all its people and suppliers. easyJet’s safety 
is managed and maintained through business processes 
and structures.
The Chief Executive of easyJet takes overall responsibilty for 
safety, alongside the Accountable Managers of easyJet 
Switzerland S.A. (EZS) and easyJet Europe Airline GmbH 
(easyJet Europe Airline). The Director of Safety, Security & 
Compliance reports directly to the Chief Executive and 
Chairman and has a remit to act independently outside  
other operational or commercial considerations.
The Safety Committee, made up of independent Non-
Executive Directors, also reviews safety matters. More 
information on the Safety Committee is provided on page 57.
EASYJET EUROPE SAFETY REGULATION
easyJet Europe Airline was this year awarded an Air Operator 
Certificate by Austro Control and an airline operating licence  
by Austria’s Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and 
Technology.
Austria’s aviation regulator Austro Control was selected as the 
best fit for easyJet. Austro Control has a rigorous approach to 
safety regulation and has contributed to EASA’s work on 
shaping future safety regulation that emphasises performance 
based safety regulation.
 
SAFETY IS OUR  
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
SECURITY
The easyJet Security Team works closely with government 
and regulatory agencies throughout its network in order to 
minimise the vulnerability of its customers and people to 
security risks. Security risk assessments, informed by the 
current geopolitical situation, are made for each country and 
airport to which easyJet flies. The Group also employs 
measures to protect business and personal data.
FATIGUE RISK MANAGEMENT
easyJet manages the risk of fatigue to make sure that its 
crew can operate flights safely. Its Fatigue Risk Management 
System is approved to EASA standards and the Company 
continues to invest in fatigue research with the US National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the 
Netherlands Aerospace Centre.
SAFETY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
easyJet carries out its oversight of safety in its supply chain 
through its Standards Assurance and Compliance Monitoring 
processes. Standards Assurance enables managers to 
undertake performance reviews through sample checks to 
monitor service level agreements, key performance indicators 
and supplier engagement activities. Compliance Monitoring 
is undertaken by easyJet’s independent Operations Risk 
compliance monitoring team. The audit schedule is established 
on a risk-based programme focused on applicable standards 
throughout the supply chain.
DISRUPTIVE PASSENGERS
easyJet does not tolerate disruptive behaviour on its flights. 
Its crew are trained to assess all situations to ensure that the 
safety of the flight and passengers is not compromised at any 
time. The airline has introduced measures to discourage and 
prevent disruptive behaviour, and to further increase the 
support for crew to respond when it does occur.
Disruptive behaviour on-board is often caused by passengers 
who have consumed too much alcohol whilst in the airport 
before their flight or who consume on-board alcohol 
purchased at the airport. easyJet has been working with 
industry partners through Airline UK’s Code of Practice which 
encourages voluntary action. easyJet is also seeking regulatory 
changes to further discourage excess alcohol consumption 
when travelling.
NEW TECHNOLOGY
easyJet continues to add new safety related technology to the 
aircraft fleet. The A320neo aircraft which began entering the 
fleet in June 2017 are fitted with the Autopilot Traffic Collision 
Avoidance System (APTCAS), which builds on the existing 
collision avoidance technology, and the Runway Overrun 
Prevention System (ROPS), which provides additional warnings 
to pilots to avoid high energy approaches which contribute to 
runway overrun risks. These technologies supplement the 
existing operating procedures and pilot training.

STRATEGIC REPORT
WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
easyJet wants to make travel easy and affordable for its 
customers. By being honest and fair with customers, easyJet 
will earn their loyalty.
Some of easyJet’s suppliers directly provide services to  
easyJet customers and all suppliers help to deliver the overall 
service. easyJet believes that positive relationships create 
long-term, productive partnerships which in turn improve 
customer service.
CUSTOMERS
This financial year easyJet carried more than 80 million 
passengers. More information on the service we provide  
to customers and customer satisfaction is on page 13.
easyJet recognises that it needs to give extra support to 
particular groups of passengers. These include passengers 
who need special assistance or experience disruption.
CUSTOMERS WHO NEED SPECIAL ASSISTANCE 
In 2012 easyJet established the easyJet Special Assistance 
Advisory Group (ESAAG) to provide feedback and guidance 
on the services it provides to passengers who require 
special assistance.
The Group is chaired by Lord David Blunkett, a former UK 
cabinet minister who is himself blind. The group includes 
members from key easyJet markets (the UK, France, 
Switzerland and Italy) and all have personal or professional 
experience of special assistance issues.
easyJet carried over 519,000 passengers who needed special 
assistance in the 2017 financial year. This increased by 14% 
from the prior financial year. Customer satisfaction amongst 
these passengers was 83%. This is down one percentage point 
year-on-year, however, it was 12 percentage points higher than 
customer satisfaction amongst all passengers. This is the 
fourth successive year that satisfaction is higher for customers 
who need special assistance.
 Since 2012 easyJet and ESAAG have introduced a range of 
measures to assist passengers with physical constraints, such 
as on-board wheelchairs and more accessible aircraft 
bathrooms. They are now looking at what more support can 
be given to passengers with ‘hidden disabilities’. In July 2017 
ESAAG brought together charities that represent people with 
these conditions, as well as the UK Civil Aviation Authority, to 
discuss these issues.
SUPPORTING PASSENGERS DURING DISRUPTION
easyJet is committed to providing the right support to 
passengers during disruption. Passengers are already given 
timely updates about their flight through text messages, emails 
and live updates on easyJet’s Flight Tracker tool. This year 
easyJet further improved the information, by adding 
information about the reason for a delay and what passengers 
should do next.
To reduce the time it takes to resolve aircraft technical faults, 
easyJet contracted two light aircraft and crew for summer 
2017 to take engineers and spare parts around its network.
When there are delays, easyJet provides welfare support, 
overnight accommodation when it is required and covers 
all reasonable out of pocket expenses for extended delay 
situations and additional EU 261 payments, when the delay 
is caused by an airline issue. It has established an online 
compensation claim form and bank transfer program, to 
simplify applications and payments.
SUPPLIERS
easyJet seeks to have an open, constructive and effective 
relationship with all suppliers, as it believes they are integral  
to the Group’s success.
easyJet has an established supplier relationship management 
framework, which provides a toolkit and guidance for easyJet 
managers who lead relationships with easyJet’s key partners. 
The supplier relationship management framework is developed 
around easyJet’s core values and the objective is to build 
strong, lasting relationships with partners and drive value 
from the partnership. The principles are based on managing 
suppliers in the same way that easyJet manages its people, 
and ensuring that suppliers’ rights and responsibilities are 
clearly set out.
When tendering for new suppliers, easyJet seeks information 
to ensure compliance from suppliers on factors including 
quality assurance, health and safety, environmental practices, 
sub-contracting arrangements and legal, regulatory and  
tax compliance.
HUMAN RIGHTS AND MODERN SLAVERY ACT
easyJet is committed to human rights. This includes 
observance of the principles set out by the International 
Labour Organisation Declaration on Fundamental Principles 
and Rights at Work.
easyJet manages the risk of modern slavery in its supply chain. 
It published its first statement for the Modern Slavery Act in 
March 2017, which is available at https://corporate.easyjet.com.
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
easyJet has a company-wide anti-bribery and corruption 
policy. There is also a gifts and hospitality policy and an 
online register to record all gifts and hospitality that are 
accepted by employees.
When tendering key new supplier contracts easyJet 
informs suppliers of its anti-bribery and corruption and gifts 
and hospitality policies and requires compliance with the same 
as a condition of doing business with easyJet. Subsequently, in 
key contracts, an appointed supplier is expected to reaffirm its 
commitment by signing up to specific contractual obligations 
on anti-bribery and corruption in its contract with easyJet.

GENDER PAY
easyJet voluntarily reported on its gender pay gap in 2015 and 
2016, ahead of the new UK regulations.
easyJet’s gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the salaries 
and gender make-up of its pilot community, which is around a 
quarter of its UK employees. Pilots are predominantly male and 
their higher salaries, relative to other employees, significantly 
increases the average male pay at easyJet.
Salaries for pilots and cabin crew are collectively agreed, 
meaning, for example, female pilots’ or cabin crew’s basic 
salary and variable pay rates are 100% of that of their  
male equivalents.
DIFFERENCE IN UK RATE OF PAY BETWEEN MEN  
AND WOMEN
 Mean
Difference in mean hourly rate of pay 51.71%
Difference in mean bonus pay 43.77%
Notes: Pay and bonus data for UK employees as specified by UK reporting 
requirements.

gender pay report at www.easyjet.com
DISABILITY
easyJet treats applicants with disabilities equally and supports 
current employees who become disabled. This includes 
offering flexibility and making reasonable adjustments to the 
workplace to ensure they can achieve to their full potential. 
However, for easyJet’s two largest communities, pilots and 
cabin crew, there are a range of regulatory requirements on 
health and physical ability which all applicants and current 
employees must comply with.
WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
easyJet wants to be a good employer so that it can attract, 
retain and develop the best people. It believes that a diverse 
workforce that reflects the diversity of its customers, and a 
culture in which people can be themselves at work, leads to a 
better service for customers.
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT ACROSS EUROPE
As at 30 September 2017 easyJet employed 12,280 people 
across its network.
easyJet employs people on local contracts in eight countries 
across Europe, complying with national laws. This has a higher 
cost than the approach taken by some other airlines that 
employ all their people on one contract, irrespective of where 
they may work. easyJet does this so that its roles are attractive 
locally and to reflect each country’s employment practices. 
This also helps to build relationships with key local stakeholders.
easyJet regularly communicates with its employees about 
business priorities and issues, as well as financial performance. 
This includes a weekly podcast from the Chief Executive, 
newsletters for the pilot and cabin crew communities and a 
regularly updated internal news site.
This year easyJet has continued to address issues that are 
important to its employees, particularly its crew, such as roster 
stability and reducing disruption, which also affects crew’s 
working hours.
easyJet works in partnership with 20 trade unions across eight 
countries. It also consults its employees across Europe on 
business issues through its Works Councils structure and the 
overarching European Works Council forum.
REWARD
easyJet offers a competitive reward package, focused on cash 
and variable pay rather than fixed benefits. All easyJet 
employees, with a minimum amount of service, have the 
opportunity to become shareholders in the Company.
FEMALE PILOTS AND ENGINEERS
Since 2015 easyJet has been seeking to encourage more 
women to become pilots, to help address the significant 
gender imbalance in the world-wide pilot community.
Through its ‘Amy Johnson Initiative’ easyJet has arranged for 
pilots to visit schools and youth organisations, highlighted 
current female pilots in the media and its own 
communications, and offered pilot training loan underwriting 
for selected female new entrant pilots.
easyJet met its initial target to increase the proportion of new 
entrant co-pilots who are female to 12% in 2016, a year ahead 
of schedule. In the 2017 financial year easyJet attracted 49 
female new-entrant co-pilots, which was a 48% increase on the 
33 female co-pilots in the 2016 financial year, and represented 
13% of new-entrant co-pilots attracted in this period. easyJet’s 
current target is 20% of new entrant co-pilots to be female  
by 2020.
easyJet also this year opened recruitment for 14 engineering 
apprentices and sought to encourage more women to apply 
for these roles.

STRATEGIC REPORT
WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
easyJet’s biggest impact on the environment is its fuel 
consumption and the associated carbon emissions. easyJet is 
continuing to make more efficient use of fuel and to further 
reduce emissions per passenger kilometre on its flights.
CARBON EMISSIONS
easyJet’s aircraft CO
2
 emissions in the 2017 financial year were 
7.1 million tonnes, compared to 6.5 million tonnes in the 2016 
financial year. easyJet’s calculation of emissions is based on 
fuel burn measurement, which is verified to comply with the 
European Union’s Emission Trading System requirements.
The increase in overall emissions has been due to the 
continued expansion of easyJet’s operations. In this financial 
year easyJet’s passenger numbers increased by 9.7% 
compared to the 2016 financial year.
CARBON EMISSIONS PER PASSENGER 
KILOMETRE
Since 2000 easyJet has reduced its carbon emissions per 
passenger, per kilometre by over 32%. Its current target is a 
10% reduction from its 2016 financial year performance by 
2022, which would be a 38% improvement from 2000.
In the 2017 financial year easyJet’s carbon emissions per 
passenger kilometre (km) were 78.62 grams (g), down 
from 79.98g per passenger km in the prior financial year.
EFFICIENT AIRCRAFT
easyJet operates an efficient fleet of Airbus A320 family 
aircraft mainly equipped with CFM56 engines. 
This year easyJet started to operate the new generation 
Airbus A320neo aircraft. There will be 100 of these aircraft  
in the fleet by the end of 2022. These aircraft, equipped with 
CFM LEAP-1A engines and wingtip ‘Sharklets’, are expected  
to be 15% more fuel efficient than current generation aircraft.
From summer 2018 easyJet will also start to receive 30 
A321neo aircraft, with 235 seats compared to 186 seats on the 
A320neo aircraft. This will also contribute to easyJet’s carbon 
reduction target by reducing the amount of fuel used to carry 
each passenger.
OPERATING EFFICIENTLY
easyJet continues to use operational measures to reduce 
fuel usage and carbon emissions. This includes the use of 
one engine taxiing, installation of lightweight Recaro seats, 
and the use of electronic devices rather than numerous paper 
documents in the flight deck.
SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
The tourists that easyJet, other airlines and travel operators 
bring to destinations make a very significant contribution to 
local economies. However tourism also needs to have a 
sustainable impact on the local environment and community. 
easyJet believes that if there is a need to control the tourism 
activity in a particular area then this should be done by the 
relevant local authorities, taking account of the economic 
benefit of tourism.

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
easyJet wants to make a positive contribution to society, to 
support the areas where its customers and employees live, as 
well as in the wider world.
UNICEF PARTNERSHIP
easyJet has a pan-European charity partnership with UNICEF, 
the world’s leading children’s organisation. Since 2012 the 
partnership has raised over £10 million, helping UNICEF to 
protect millions of children around the world from disease 
and keep them safe during emergencies.
During the spring, summer and winter collection periods 
easyJet cabin crew carry out on-board appeals for customers 
to donate their spare change and leftover foreign currency.
The funds primarily support UNICEF’s vaccination work to  
keep children safe from polio, as part of the global efforts  
to eradicate this deadly disease. This year the funds have 
supported activities in Pakistan, one of only three remaining 
countries where polio is still endemic, helping UNICEF 
vaccinate more than 285,300 children in some of the hardest 
to reach areas of the country.
In the 2017 financial year the partnership raised over  
£1.5 million, which included the on-board collections and  
other fundraising activity by easyJet employees and met its 
current partnership fundraising target of £10 million.
LOCAL DONATIONS
easyJet also supports local charities nominated by its 
employees, through donations awarded by its Charity 
Committee. This year the committee has made 140 awards  
of flight vouchers or financial donations, each to the value  
of £250 or €300.
EMERGENCY APPEALS
easyJet launches emergency appeals on board its aircraft, 
particularly for significant, tragic events in countries across  
its network and around the world. In the 2017 financial year 
easyJet held appeals following: the Grenfell Tower fire in 
London; the Manchester terrorist attack; the earthquake in 
Italy; and for Unicef’s response to the East Africa famine and 
Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean. 
AIRCRAFT NOISE
easyJet seeks to reduce the impact of aircraft noise on 
residents who live near airports or under flight paths. It works 
locally with airports and air traffic control to put in place noise 
mitigation activities that best fit each airport. easyJet pilots 
also use flying techniques to reduce noise impact, such as 
continuous descent approaches.
The new generation Airbus A320neo aircraft that easyJet 
started to operate this year are 50% quieter during take-off 
and landing than current generation aircraft.
easyJet is also completing a retrofit programme to address  
a particular sound associated with A320 family aircraft of all 
airlines due to the airflow under the wing. All new aircraft 
delivered to easyJet since September 2014 are fitted with 
‘vortex generators’. In 2015 easyJet began an engineering 
programme to modify existing aircraft with vortex generators. 
As of 30 September 2017 over 93% of easyJet’s fleet were 
fitted with vortex generators and easyJet expects all aircraft  
to be modified by 31 December 2017.
CASE STUDY
In June 2017 a group of 
easyJet employees 
visited the Philippines to 
see UNICEF’s work in the 
country, which had been 
supported by an earlier 
easyJet charity 
emergency appeal. The 
group saw how UNICEF 
responded immediately 
following the 2013 
typhoon and in the 
recovery, as well as the 
local polio immunisation 
programme.
A GOOD CITIZEN
Corporate responsibility / continued Chairman’s statement on corporate governance
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present to you this year’s Corporate 
governance report. The Board remains committed to 
maintaining a high standard of governance to enhance 
performance, drive continued good behaviours and protect 
shareholders. During 2017 the following key areas of 
governance were discussed:
CULTURE IN THE ORGANISATION
easyJet is committed to nurturing an open and communicative 
culture which encourages employee participation in the 
exchange of ideas, information and suggestions. Significant 
work has taken place over the year to identify and review 
issues related to the Group’s culture, using Internal Audit 
reports, corporate governance questionnaires and external 
studies. Our review concluded that there was good 
engagement, collaboration and accountability within the 
organisation, and the tone from the top was right. We will 
continue to review and report on our culture and this will 
remain a key focus in 2018.
SUCCESSION PLANNING  
AND CHANGES TO THE BOARD
This year has been particularly busy for both the Board and 
the Nominations Committee in relation to succession planning, 
assessing the Executive, Non-Executive and senior succession 
pipeline, and identifying what skills are needed to support our 
strategy and business for the long-term.
On 10 November the Board announced the appointment of 
Johan Lundgren as its new Chief Executive as replacement for 
Carolyn McCall. He will be joining the Company on 1 December 
2017, with Carolyn stepping down as Chief Executive on 30 
November but remaining with easyJet until 31 December 2017 
to assist with the transition. The Nominations Committee led 
the process to appoint the new Chief Executive, with support 
from the other Non-Executive Directors throughout the 
process. Johan was appointed following a rigorous assessment 
and selection process. 
We welcomed Moya Greene to the Board on 19 July 2017 
as a Non-Executive Director. She also became a member 
of the Remuneration and Safety Committees in September. 
Her logistics and transport background and FTSE 100 CEO 
experience have already served to strengthen the diverse 
mix of expertise and experience on the Board.
Committed to  
corporate governance
JOHN BARTON
Chairman
The recruitment and selection process for Johan and Moya, 
along with further detail on the activities of the Nominations 
Committee, are set out on page 58.
Keith Hamill had decided to retire from the easyJet Board at 
the end of July, however he extended his term for a further 
period to support the Chief Executive search process. François 
Rubichon stepped down on 22 July 2017, following completion 
of three years on the Board.
I would like to thank Carolyn on behalf of the Board for her 
commitment and important contribution to the easyJet Board 
and to easyJet’s success. 
BREXIT
A main focus for the Board has continued to be overseeing 
and carefully reviewing management’s plans, and evaluating 
key decisions, to protect the airline’s existing flying rights when 
the UK leaves the European Union. This has been discussed 
and presented at every scheduled Board meeting during  
the year.
easyJet has made significant progress in safeguarding the 
future of its operations and network in Europe over the last 
year. In July this year, following a rigorous and comprehensive 
process, we were granted an Air Operator Certificate and 
airline operating licence by the authorities in Austria which  
will support our European operations in the lead up to and 
post-Brexit. 
GOVERNANCE
I am pleased to report that we have complied without 
exception with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (April 2016). The Code is issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council and is available for review on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC) website: https://www.frc.org.uk.
This year our remuneration policy is due for approval by the 
Company’s shareholders. The Remuneration Committee has 
been working closely with the Group and its advisers to 
produce a policy that promotes the sustainable long-term 
success of the business. Further information can be found  
in the Remuneration Committee section on page 64.
STRUCTURE OF THE CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE REPORT
The Corporate governance report which follows indicates the 
Board’s approach to corporate governance arrangements and 
how they operated during the year. The report includes reports 
from each of the Committee Chairs, providing details on key 
matters addressed by the Committees during the year.
We have also set out a separate section (on pages 53 to 55) 
to provide a detailed description of how the Group has 
complied with all principles of the UK Corporate  
Governance Code.

BOARD COMMITTEE STRUCTURE
52 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Compliance with the UK  
Corporate Governance Code 
A.4 Non-Executive Directors
Charles Gurassa is Senior Independent Director and Deputy 
Chairman. In this role, Charles provides advice and additional 
support and experience to the Chairman as required, and is 
available to act as an intermediary for the other Directors if 
necessary. Charles is also available to address shareholders’ 
concerns that have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of communication with the Chairman, Chief Executive 
or other Executive Directors, and leads the appraisal of the 
Chairman’s performance annually in consultation with the other 
Non-Executive Directors in a meeting without the Chairman 
being present. The Non-Executive Directors, together with 
the Chairman, also meet regularly without any Executive 
Directors. During the year, there were no unresolved concerns 
regarding the running of the Group.
B. EFFECTIVENESS
B.1 Composition of the Board
As at 30 September 2017, the Board comprised seven 
Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) and 
two Executive Directors.
After considering the matter, the Board considers Adèle 
Anderson, Dr. Andreas Bierwirth, Charles Gurassa, Keith Hamill 
OBE, Andy Martin and Moya Greene to be Non-Executive 
Directors who are independent in character and judgment. The 
Board reviews its Committee membership each year to ensure 
that undue reliance is not placed on individuals.
B.2 Appointments to the Board
The Nominations Committee leads the process for Board 
appointments and makes recommendations to the Board. For 
information on the work of the Nominations Committee and a 
description of the Board’s policy on diversity, please refer to 
the Nominations Committee report on pages 57 and 58.
B.3 Commitment
Following the Board evaluation process, detailed further below, 
the Board is satisfied that each of the Directors is able to 
allocate sufficient time to the Group to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively.
Contracts and letters of appointment with Directors 
are made available at the Annual General Meeting or 
on request. The standard terms and conditions of the 
appointment of Non-Executive Directors are also available 
in the governance section of easyJet’s corporate website:  
http://corporate.easyJet.com.
Executive Directors and the Executive Management Team are 
permitted to take up non-executive positions on a board of a 
listed company so long as this is not thought to interfere with 
the business of the Group. Carolyn McCall DBE, the Chief 
Executive, has acted as Non-Executive Director at Burberry 
Group plc since September 2014. Andrew Findlay was 
appointed Non-Executive Director at Rightmove plc in June 
2017. Executive Directors’ appointments to such positions is 
subject to the approval of the Board which considers, amongst 
other things, the time commitment required. 
The Group has, throughout the 2017 financial year, 
complied without exception with the provisions of the 2016  
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). The section 
below details how the Company has complied with the Code, 
available at http://www.frc.org.uk. The following disclosures  
are ordered into the sections as they appear in the Code.
A. LEADERSHIP
A.1 Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for providing effective leadership 
to the airline. It does this by setting strategic priorities and 
overseeing their delivery in a way that enables sustainable 
long-term growth, while maintaining a balanced approach 
to risk within a framework of effective controls.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
its decision which is available in the governance section of 
easyJet’s corporate website: http://corporate.easyJet.com. 
Day-to-day management responsibility rests with the 
Executive Management Team, listed on pages 50 to 51. 
These individuals are also the Directors and Company 
Secretary of the principal operating company, easyJet 
Airline Company Limited.
The Board meets regularly, with 10 scheduled meetings  
having been held during the year. The Directors’ attendance 
records at those meetings and Board Committee meetings 
held during the year are shown in the table on page 52. In 
addition to those scheduled meetings, five ad hoc Board calls 
were also arranged during the 2017 financial year to deal with 
matters arising between scheduled meetings as appropriate. 
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to communicate 
directly with each other and senior management between 
Board meetings.
The Group has purchased and maintains appropriate insurance 
cover in respect of Directors’ and Officers’ liabilities.
The Group has also entered into qualifying third party 
indemnity arrangements for the benefit of all its Directors, in 
a form and scope which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
A.2 Division of responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, 
set out in writing, clearly defined, and approved by the 
Board. They are available on easyJet’s corporate website:  
http://corporate.easyJet.com. The Chairman’s role is to 
lead the Board and ensure that it operates effectively. 
The Chief Executive’s role is the day-to-day running of the 
Group’s businesses and the development and implementation 
of strategy.
A.3 The Chairman
The Chairman, John Barton, sets the Board’s agenda and 
ensures that adequate time is available for discussion of all 
agenda items, including strategic issues. On his appointment 
in May 2013, the Board considered John Barton to be 
independent in character and judgment in accordance with 
the Code.
GOVERNANCE

B.4 Development
On joining the Board, new members receive a tailored 
induction, organised by the Company Secretary, which covers 
amongst other things: the business of the Group, their legal 
and regulatory responsibilities as Directors, briefings and 
presentations from relevant executives and opportunities to 
visit and experience easyJet’s business operations.  
To update the Directors’ skills, knowledge and familiarity 
with the Group, visits to bases are organised for the Board 
periodically, to assist its understanding of the operational 
issues that the business faces. The Board was invited to 
visit the base in Gatwick in March 2017, and to attend a 
presentation on Gatwick Airport, as well as a site tour which 
included a visit to the new bag drop area, and the new airside 
crew facility, with the chance to meet the base management 
team and members of the crew.
A briefing paper is provided to Board members to update 
them on relevant developments in law, regulation and best 
practice, usually two to four times per year. Directors are 
encouraged to highlight specific areas where they feel their 
skills or knowledge would benefit from further development 
as part of the annual Board evaluation process.
B.5 Information and support
All members of the Board are supplied with appropriate, clear 
and accurate information in a timely manner covering matters 
which are to be considered at forthcoming Board or 
Committee meetings.
Should Directors judge it necessary to seek independent 
legal advice about the performance of their duties with 
the Company, they are entitled to do so at the Company’s 
expense. Directors also have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the 
Board on all governance matters and ensuring that Board 
procedures are complied with.
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is 
a matter requiring Board approval.
B.6 Evaluation
A performance review of the Board, its Committees and 
Directors is carried out every year and is externally facilitated 
at least every third year. Following the evaluation being 
externally facilitated in 2015, the 2017 Board and Committee 
evaluation was conducted internally by the Company Secretary 
and Group General Counsel, Kyla Mullins, at the request of the 
Chairman. Kyla prepared surveys that were completed by 
Board members.
The review extended to all aspects of Board and Committee 
performance including composition and dynamics, the 
Chairman’s leadership, agenda and focus, time management, 
strategic oversight, oversight of risk and succession planning, 
and priorities for change.
Charles Gurassa, as Senior Independent Director, led a review 
of the Chairman’s performance and held a private meeting of 
the Non-Executive Directors without the Chairman present to 
discuss the Chairman’s performance. It was concluded that 
John Barton’s performance and contribution are strong and 
that he demonstrates effective leadership. The Executive 
Directors and the Non-Executive Directors also reviewed and 
were satisfied with the Chairman’s time commitment to the 
Board and the business.
The Chairman conducted a process of evaluating the 
performance and contribution of each Director, which included 
a one-to-one performance evaluation and feedback discussion 
with each of them.
B.7 Re-election
The Company’s Articles of Association require the Directors 
to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at least 
once every three years. However, the Board has decided that 
all Directors will stand for re-election or election at each Annual 
General Meeting in accordance with the Code.
C. ACCOUNTABILITY
C.1 Financial and Business Reporting
Please refer to:
• page 88 for the Board’s statement on the Annual report 
and accounts being fair, balanced and understandable;
• page 31 for the statement on the status of the Company 
and the Group as a going concern; and
• the Strategic report on pages 4 to 21 for an explanation 
of the Group’s business model and the strategy for 
delivering the objectives of the Group.
C.2 Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and how those risks affect the 
prospects of the Group. Please refer to pages 33 to 40 
for further information on the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties and page 31 for their impact on the longer-term 
viability and prospects of the Group.
The overall responsibility for easyJet’s systems of internal 
control and for reviewing their effectiveness rests with the 
Board. The Board has conducted an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal control during the 
year, under the auspices of the Audit Committee. Further 
information on the Group’s risk management processes is 
given on this page and on its internal control systems on 
page 56.
C.3 Audit Committee and Auditors

Code provisions relating to the Audit Committee and auditors, 
please refer to the Audit Committee report on pages 59 to 62.

E. RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
E.1 Dialogue with shareholders
The Group actively engages with investors and 
solicits their feedback. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman 
met with shareholders during the year to help maintain 
a balanced understanding of their issues and concerns. They 
also attended a senior investor dinner in January and met with 
the Company’s top 10 institutional investors. The Chairman has 
updated the Board on the opinions of investors. The views of 
shareholders and market perceptions are also communicated 
to the Board via presentations by the Head of Investor 
Relations at least every quarter.

opportunity to communicate directly with the Board and 
encourages their participation. Shareholders are given the 
opportunity to raise issues formally at the Annual General 
Meeting or informally with Directors after the meeting. All 
Directors normally attend the Annual General Meeting and  
the Chairs of the Committees are available to answer 
questions at the Annual General Meeting.

on key business issues.
 During the year, the Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief 
Executive met with representatives of easyGroup Holdings 
Limited, the Company’s largest shareholder, to discuss relevant 
matters. The Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel have 
also met separately with representatives of easyGroup Ltd

GOVERNANCE
55 www.easyJet.com RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Board has overall responsibility for easyJet’s risk 
management and systems of internal control. 
Risk management 
easyJet has an established risk management process to ensure 
that significant risks are identified and mitigated where possible. 
For further details of the risk management process, the 
principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group and the 
associated mitigating actions, please refer to pages 33 to 40. 
To ensure that risks are managed effectively, a number of 
activities are undertaken: 
• An Executive Management Team member is allocated as 
the risk owner for each principal risk, with responsibility for 
the day-to-day management of those risks. 
• Ongoing risk management and assurance is provided 
through the various monitoring reviews and reporting 
mechanisms that are embedded into the business 
operations. The results of these reviews are reported to the 
Audit Committee and the Board, which consider whether 
these high-level risks are being effectively controlled. 
• Regular operational (including safety), commercial, financial 
and IT functional meetings are held to review performance 
and to consider key risks and issues (please refer to page 
57 for details of the Safety Committee).
• The Executive Management Team meets regularly to 
consider significant risks, status of risk mitigations and 
overall business performance; this ensures key issues are 
escalated through the management team and, as 
appropriate, ultimately to the Board. 
• The Directors review the effectiveness of internal controls, 
including operating, financial and compliance controls. 
The Audit Committee undertakes an annual review of the 
appropriateness of the risk management processes to ensure 
that they are sufficiently robust to meet the needs of the 
Group (please refer to pages 59 to 62 for details of the Audit 
Committee’s responsibilities). 
 Internal control 
The responsibility for establishing and operating detailed 
control procedures lies with the Chief Executive. The internal 
control systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. By their 
nature, they can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The internal financial control monitoring programme, 
administered by Internal Audit, has continued to enhance the 
review process. The internal control regime is supported by the 
operation of a whistleblower reporting function. The system is 
operated by a specialist external third party service provider 
and allows employees to report concerns anonymously and in 
confidence. The Audit Committee has approved the processes 
and reporting structure for the function, and receives regular 
reports on its operation. 
Internal Audit 
The Internal Audit function’s key objectives are to provide 
independent and objective assurance on risks and controls to 
the Board, Audit Committee and senior management, and to 
assist the Board in meeting its corporate governance and 
regulatory responsibilities. The audit plan is approved by the 
Audit Committee on behalf of the Board, and updated on a 
rolling basis. 
Internal Audit reviews the extent to which systems of 
internal control: 
• are designed and operating effectively; 
• are adequate to manage easyJet’s key risks; and 
• safeguard the Group’s assets. 
During the second half of the year the Internal Audit and Risk 
Management functions were merged to create a single Risk 
and Assurance team. The Head of Risk and Assurance reports 
directly to the Chief Financial Officer and continues to have 
direct access to the Chief Executive and the Chair of the Audit 
Committee. The Head of Risk and Assurance is invited to, and 
attends, Audit Committee meetings throughout the year and 
reports regularly on Internal Audit reviews to the Executive 
Management Team. 
During the year, an external effectiveness assessment of the 
Internal Audit function was completed by Mazars LLP on 
behalf of the Audit Committee. The role of the Internal Audit 
function and the scope of its work both continue to evolve 
to take account of recommendations from the external 
effectiveness review, changes within the business, and 
emerging best practice. A formal audit charter is in place.

HIGHLIGHTS DURING THE 2017 FINANCIAL YEAR
A range of safety-related matters have been reviewed by the 
Committee during the 2017 financial year involving all areas – 
flight operations, cabin crew, ground services and engineering. 
Some of these reviews followed requests from the Board to 
carry out detailed assessments of specific operational 
incidents; others were reports of safety actions taken by 
easyJet operational departments, and investigations by 
national investigation authorities.
In line with easyJet’s position that safety is our number one 
priority, the Safety Committee continues to ensure that 
safety receives the highest level of Board attention.
The Director of Safety, Security & Compliance has a direct 
reporting line to the Chairman which reinforces the 
independence of safety oversight. In addition, the Chair of 
the Committee has reported to the Board with his own 
assessment of safety management within the airline 
throughout the year.

BOARD COMMITTEE STRUCTURE
The Committee reports that follow set out, amongst other things, the responsibilities and activities of the Committees in the  
past financial year. 
The terms of reference of each Committee are documented and agreed by the Board. The Committees’ terms of reference  
are reviewed annually and are available in the governance section of easyJet’s corporate website: http://corporate.easyJet.com 
The Chair of each Board Committee formally reports back to the Board on a regular basis.
Details of Directors’ attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings are set out on page 52.
GOVERNANCE
57 www.easyJet.com SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Board satisfies itself that plans are in place for orderly 
succession for appointments to the Board, to maintain 
appropriate skills and experience on the Board. During the 
year, it was discussed and agreed that management 
development plans for senior management would be put  
in place.
BOARD APPOINTMENTS
As reported in last year’s Annual report, last summer the 
Committee undertook a deep dive analysis in calibrating the 
capability and skills of the current Board against the future 
requirements of the Board in terms of size, structure, 
composition and behaviour, with the support of an external 
consultant, Calibroconsult Limited. The Committee adopts a 
formal and transparent procedure for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board (both executive and non-executive). For 
each recruitment process, the executive search consultant was 
provided with a detailed brief of the desired candidate profile 
based on merit and against objective criteria. The Committee 
worked closely with the executive search consultants in 
compiling long and short lists of candidates and members of 
the Committee identified and interviewed a range of 
candidates from various backgrounds and industries, and all 
candidates were measured against criteria agreed at the start 
of each respective process. Further details of each specific 
search process is set out below. A comprehensive induction 
was provided on Moya’s appointment and is in train for Johan 
– and more details of Moya’s induction can be found on 
page 55.
Chief Executive appointment
Chief Executive succession planning is regularly discussed and 
reviewed at the Committee which provided a helpful 
background to the recruitment process. Following the 
announcement of Carolyn McCall’s resignation as Chief 
Executive on 17 July 2017, the Committee immediately 
commenced a rigorous recruitment process to appoint a new 
Chief Executive. JCA Group (JCA) were appointed to act as 
easyJet’s executive search consultants with respect to the 
search for a new Chief Executive. Other than supporting 
historic Board and senior executive appointments the Board 
confirms that JCA has no other connection with the Group. 
The Committee worked closely with JCA in compiling long and 
short lists of candidates, had weekly updates either via call or 
email from the Chairman, and a number of ad hoc Committee 
meetings took place to which all the Non-Executive Directors 
were invited and largely attended. The final shortlisted 
candidates took part in a leadership assessment process by 
YSC, a leading assessment organisation with significant 
experience of CEO profiling. The final shortlisted candidates 
also met all of the Non-Executive Directors individually or in 
small groups, and gave a presentation to the Non-Executive 
Board as a whole. Following this process, Johan Lundgren was 
selected as the preferred candidate. 
Non-Executive Director appointment
In appointing Non-Executive Directors, the Board’s practice is 
to use external search consultants. Following a selection 
process, terms were negotiated with Egon Zehnder to act as 
easyJet’s search consultants with respect to the search for a 
new Non-Executive Director which resulted in the appointment 
of Moya Greene. Other than supporting historic Board and 
senior executive appointments, Egon Zehnder has no 
connection with the Group. The detailed brief of the desired 
candidate profile provided to Egon Zehnder included an 
assessment of the time commitment expected and candidates 
were interviewed by the Nominations Committee and other 
members of the Board. The Nominations Committee 
considered a list of potential candidates and the balance of 
skills, knowledge, independence, diversity (including gender) 
and experience on the Board to ensure that a suitable balance 
was maintained. Following this process, Moya Greene joined 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director. Moya’s other significant 
commitments were disclosed to the Board before her 
appointment and are provided on page 49.
DIVERSITY
The Board recognises the benefits of having diversity across 
all areas of the Group and believes that this supports easyJet’s 
continued success and advantage. When considering the 
optimum make-up of the Board, the benefits of diversity of 
the Board are appropriately reviewed and balanced where 
possible, and due regard given in terms of differences in skills, 
industry experience, business model experiences, gender, 
gender expression, gender identity, race, disability, age, 
nationality, background and other contributions that individuals 
may make. The list of ways in which diversity is considered is 
non-exhaustive, and subject to regular review. The Committee 
continues to encourage diversity of business skills and 
experience, recognising that Directors with varying skill sets, 
capabilities and experience gained from different geographic 
and cultural backgrounds enhance the Board. In identifying 
suitable candidates, the Committee will seek candidates from 
a range of backgrounds, with the final decision being based 
on merit against objective criteria. 
easyJet works hard to create an environment where women 
have the opportunity to build careers in all communities and at 
all management levels of the organisation, by ensuring there is 
a pipeline of women coming up through the organisation. As 
at 30 September 2017, the Company had three female 
Directors at plc Board level, one being the Chief Executive, 
equating to a 33% female Board representation. easyJet’s 
policy on diversity applies across all levels of the organisation, 
and further details can be found in the Corporate responsibility 
section on page 44, including further details of the Executive 
Management Team.

58 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTING
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. For example, during 
the financial year, the Committee reviewed the level of 
provisions and accruals recorded which are judgemental in 
nature. The Committee reviewed accounting papers prepared 
by management which provide details on significant financial 
reporting judgements. The Committee also reviewed the 
reports by the external auditors on the full year and half year 
results which highlight any issues with respect to the work 
undertaken on the audit. 
The Committee reviewed financial issues through discussion 
with management and the external auditors and comparison 
to other organisations. The number of such issues currently 
considered as significant are, however, limited given easyJet’s 
relatively simple business model and group structure which are 
unencumbered with legacy issues. The significant issues 
considered in relation to the accounts are detailed below:
• The Committee considered whether the carrying value of 
goodwill and landing rights held by easyJet should be 
impaired. The judgement in relation to impairment largely 
relates to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the 
value in use of the business being tested for impairment; 
primarily whether the forecasted cash flows are achievable 
and the overall macroeconomic assumptions which 
underlie the valuation process. The Committee addressed 
these matters using reports received from management 
outlining the basis for assumptions used. The forecasted 
cash flows used in the calculation were presented to the 
Board and they concluded no impact on impairment.
• The Committee considered a detailed review of the 
assumptions underpinning aircraft residual value estimates 
along with the treatment of the sale of 10 A319 aircraft in 
December 2016 and their immediate lease back. The sale 
and leaseback transaction led to reconsideration of the 
accounting policy for maintenance provisions on a mid-life 
sale and leaseback, so that the maintenance catch-up 
commitment crystallising was recognised immediately in the 
income statement. This accounting policy change resulted 
in a prior year adjustment of previous maintenance provision 
catch-ups, which were historically held on the balance sheet 
and released over the lease term (see page 99).
• The Committee considered changes to the presentation 
of performance measures and to the income statement 
resulting from the separate reporting of ‘non-headline’ items, 
being non-recurring material items of income and expense 
that are significant in either nature or amount, or items 
which are not considered to be reflective of the trading 
performance of the business. This change provides readers 
with a clearer view of easyJet’s underlying performance.
• The Committee reviewed the level and calculations of key 
accruals and provisions which are judgemental in nature, 
specifically, the areas of customer flight delays or 
cancellation and air passenger duty claims and 
maintenance provision.
 The Committee is satisfied that the judgements made by 
management are reasonable, and that appropriate disclosures 
have been included in the Annual report and accounts.
The Committee has focused on the integrity of the 
Group’s financial reporting and ensuring the appropriate 
challenge and governance around risk management. The 
Committee has continued to follow a detailed programme 
of work and to respond to the increasing depth of review 
and reporting that is now required of audit committees.
Accurate and informative ﬁnancial reporting and an 
effective control environment are of critical importance 
to the Board and our shareholders. The Committee has 
established arrangements that enable it to ensure that the 
information presented is fair, balanced and understandable.
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
(members are all independent Non-Executive Directors)

GOVERNANCE
59 www.easyJet.com At the request of the Board, the Committee also considered 
whether the Annual report and accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether they provided the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. The Committee is 
satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Annual report and 
accounts are fair, balanced and understandable. In reaching 
this conclusion, the Committee considered the overall review 
and confirmation process around the Annual report and 
accounts, including:
• the input of subject matter experts, the Executive 
Management Team and other senior management and, 
where applicable, the Board and its Committees;
• the processes and controls which underpin the overall 
review and confirmation process, including the verification 
process being carried out by an internal financial controls 
specialist (independent of the Finance function); and
• Internal Audit providing assurance over the audit trail for 
material data points relating to the non-financial statement 
aspects of the Annual report and accounts, and external 
audit providing assurance over the accounts.
The Committee was provided with, and commented on, 
a draft copy of the Annual report and accounts.
In carrying out the above processes, key considerations 
included ensuring that there was consistency between the 
accounts and the narrative provided in the front half of the 
Annual report, and that there was an appropriate balance 
between the reporting of weaknesses, difficulties and 
challenges, as well as successes, in an open and 
balanced manner.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic report. easyJet’s going concern 
statement and longer-term viability statement can be found 
on page 31. 
 RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board, as a whole, including the Audit Committee 
members, considers the nature and extent of easyJet’s risk 
management framework and the risk profile that is acceptable 
in order to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives. The Audit 
Committee has reviewed the work done by management, the 
Committee itself and the Board on the assessment of the 
Group’s principal risks, including their impact on the prospects 
of the Group. As a result, it is considered that the Board has 
fulfilled its obligations under the Code in relation to risk 
management and internal controls. Further details on the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties and their impact on 
the prospects of the Group are set out on pages 34 to 40.

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES AND HOW THEY WERE DISCHARGED BY 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE DURING THE 2017 FINANCIAL YEAR
The Committee reviewed the 
financial statements and 
announcements relating to the 
financial performance and 
governance of the Group at year 
end and half year. The Committee 
discussed and carefully considered 
and reviewed the new Standards, 
IFRS 9, 15 and 16, accounting  
policy implications.
The Committee also considered the 
material areas in which significant 
judgements were applied based on 
reports from both the Group’s 
management and the external 
auditors. Further information is 
provided in the Financial and 
Business reporting section on 
page 59.
Integrity of financial statements
Internal financial controls and risk 
management systems
Internal Audit effectiveness  
and review of activities
The Committee undertook an 
assessment of the effectiveness  
and independence of the Internal 
Audit function, which included 
consideration of:
• key Internal Audit reports;
• stakeholder feedback on the 
quality of Internal Audit activity;
• Internal Audit’s compliance  
with prevailing professional 
standards; and
• the implementation of Internal 
Audit recommendations.
The Committee also commissioned 
and reviewed an external quality 
assessment of the Internal Audit 
function in February. Further 
information is provided in the Risk 
Management and Internal Control 
section on pages 60 and 61.
The Committee reviewed the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Group’s ongoing risk management 
systems and control processes, 
through an evaluation of:
• the risk and assurance plans;
• Internal Audit reports;
• risk assessments;
• information security and business 
continuity;
• control themes; and
• internal financial control 
assessments.
60 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 KEY RESPONSIBILITIES AND HOW THEY WERE DISCHARGED BY 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE DURING THE 2017 FINANCIAL YEAR
Relationship with external auditor (independence, 
objectivity, process effectiveness, engagement)
Systems and controls for prevention of bribery, detection  
of fraud and whistleblowing policy
Other specific items looked at as part of main activities
The Committee reviewed and monitored the external 
auditor independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant UK professional and  
regulatory requirements. 
There is regular engagement with the external auditors 
during Committee meetings and ad hoc meetings 
(when required), including meetings without any 
member of management being present. At the end of 
the financial year, each Committee member completes 
an auditor effectiveness review questionnaire.
Further information on how the effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of the external audit 
process were assessed, is provided in the External 
auditors and effectiveness of external audit  
process section.
The Committee implemented a revised non-audit 
services policy to reflect updated regulation and 
guidance. More information on the external auditors’ 
non-audit services, and audit tendering, is provided in 
the Non-audit services and the Audit tendering 
sections respectively.
The Committee noted the principal findings of the 
FRC 2016 Audit Quality Review on the external auditor. 
The Committee reviewed whistleblower reports, reports on 
anti-bribery and corruption procedures, reports on procedures 
on fraud and loss prevention and reports on credit card fraud 
and monitoring and investigations. The Committee’s objective 
is to ensure that arrangements are in place for the 
proportionate and independent investigation of such matters 
and for appropriate follow-up actions to take place.
• Review and approval of the controls that the Group would 
seek to implement to safeguard against any liability 
relating to the Criminal Finances Act 2017.
• A detailed review of the assumptions underpinning 
aircraft residual value estimates.
• The approval of an ongoing approach to auditing culture 
within the organisation, which was reported on by Risk 
and Assurance for the first time in the year. See further 
detail in the Chairman’s statement on corporate 
governance on page 47.
• Review of easyJet’s exposure to fraud in contact centres 
and associated mitigating controls and action.
• Continued discussion and review of cybersecurity.
• Oversight of the appointment of the new Head of Risk 
and Assurance.
easyJet’s system of internal controls, along with its design 
and operating effectiveness, is subject to review by the 
Audit Committee, through reports received from management, 
along with those from both internal and external auditors. Any 
control deficiencies identified are followed up with action plans 
tracked by the Committee. Further details of risk management 
and internal control are set out on page 56.
RISK AND ASSURANCE 
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the work of 
the Internal Audit function. It reviews and approves the scope 
of the Internal Audit annual plan and assesses the quality of 
Internal Audit reports, along with management’s actions 
relating to findings and the closure of recommended actions. 
The Audit Committee also considers stakeholder feedback on 
the quality of Internal Audit’s work. 
The Corporate Governance Code requires organisations 
to have a strong and effective internal audit function. The 
Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) requires the 
quality of the internal audit function to be assessed by an 
independent external party every five years. In order to 
comply with these guidelines and to continuously improve, 
easyJet engaged with Mazars LLP to conduct an independent 
review of the Internal Audit function. This report and its 
recommendations was presented to the Committee during 
the year. 
Since the review, a new Head of Risk and Assurance has been 
appointed. Looking forward, the Risk and Assurance team will 
move towards a fully risk-based audit plan, with varying 
breadth and depth of reviews. This will include greater focus 
on providing assurance over relationships with key third parties. 
In order to safeguard the independence of the Internal Audit 
function, the Head of Risk and Assurance (who heads up the 
Internal Audit function) is given the opportunity to meet 
privately with the Audit Committee without any other 
members of management present. 
Further information on the Internal Audit function is provided 
on page 56. 
EXTERNAL AUDITORS AND EFFECTIVENESS  
OF EXTERNAL AUDIT PROCESS
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were reappointed auditors of 
the Company at the 2017 Annual General Meeting following a 
tender process undertaken in 2015. Senior management 
monitors the auditors’ performance, behaviour and 
effectiveness during the exercise of their duties, which informs 
the Audit Committee’s decision to recommend reappointment 
on an annual basis.
GOVERNANCE
61 www.easyJet.com Corporate governance report / continued
The Audit Committee also assesses the effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of the external auditors by, 
amongst other things:
• considering all key external auditor plans and reports; in 
particular those summarising audit work performed on 
significant risks and critical judgements identified and 
detailed audit testing thereon;
• having regular engagement with the external auditor during 
Committee meetings and ad hoc meetings (when 
required), including meetings without any member of 
management being present;
• the Committee Chair having discussions with the Senior 
Statutory Auditor ahead of each Committee meeting; and
• following the end of the financial year, each Committee 
member completing an auditor effectiveness  
review questionnaire.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
To preserve objectivity and independence, the external 
auditors do not provide consulting services unless this is in 
compliance with the Group’s non-audit services policy. During 
the year the Committee implemented a revised non-audit 
services policy to reflect the EU audit reform regulations and 
the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 2016, which is available  
in the governance section of easyJet’s corporate website,  
http://corporate.easyJet.com.
In the 2017 financial year, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP 
undertook work to provide a comfort letter in relation to the 
Company updating its Euro Medium Term Note Programme 
for which the fees were £32,000. This was considered audit 
related work and the Committee approved this work under 
the non-audit services policy. Therefore, in the 2017 
financial year the Company incurred non-audit services 
of £32,000 (2016: audit related fees of £38,000).
 AUDIT TENDERING
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were first appointed to  
audit the Annual report and accounts for the year ended  
30 September 2006, and have therefore served an 11-year 
term. Under EU audit reform legislation, companies are 
required to have a mandatory rotation of auditors after  
10 years, or 20 years if there is a compulsory retender at  
10 years. During the 2015 financial year, the Committee led  
a tender process for external audit services, following which 
the Audit Committee agreed to recommend that the Board 
reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as, on balance, they 
performed best against the Committee’s pre-agreed  
selection and assessment criteria.

the Remuneration Committee
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report (the ‘Report’) for the year ended  
30 September 2017. The 2017 Report sets out details of  
the remuneration policy for Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors, describes how the remuneration policy is 
implemented and discloses the amounts paid relating to  
the year ended 30 September 2017 and how it will be 
implemented for the 2018 financial year.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
We announced on 17 July 2017 that our Chief Executive, 
Carolyn McCall, had advised the Board of her intention to leave 
easyJet in order to become Chief Executive of ITV plc. She 
steps down from the Board and her position as Chief 
Executive on 30 November 2017 but will continue to be 
actively employed by easyJet until 31 December 2017, in order 
to assist with the transition to the new Chief Executive. Carolyn 
will continue to receive salary and benefits over the period until 
she leaves the Business. She will not be eligible for an annual 
bonus payment for the 2017 financial year or the 2018 financial 
year; all of her unvested Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
awards have lapsed and her deferred bonus share awards will 
lapse in full beyond the end of her employment.
We were delighted to announce on 10 November 2017 the 
appointment of Johan Lundgren who will join the Board and 
replace Carolyn as Chief Executive on 1 December. The 
remuneration arrangements for Johan are fully consistent with 
our remuneration policy. The remuneration package has been 
designed to provide a competitive total pay arrangement with 
a focus on variable pay and is aligned with the long-term 
interests of shareholders. On appointment Johan will receive 
an annual salary of £740,000, an annual bonus up to a 
maximum of 200% of salary, an LTIP award of up to 250% of 
salary, pension contribution of 7% of salary and some modest 
benefits. No additional buy-outs from previously awarded 
incentive arrangements will be payable. Johan will be expected 
to build and maintain a shareholding of 200% of salary over a 
five year period following appointment.
PERFORMANCE AND REWARD OUTCOMES IN 
THE 2017 FINANCIAL YEAR
I am pleased to report that easyJet has delivered a strong 
trading performance in 2017 across the business despite the 
continuing external challenges impacting the business. This is 
reflected in our performance and incentive outcomes which 
are summarised in the ‘Remuneration at a glance’ section on 
page 67. Once again this shows the great resilience of our 
CHARLES GURASSA
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
operating model and the continued effectiveness of our 
strategy in the face of significant headwinds in the year. 
BONUS
Annual bonus payments are based on a combination of key 
financial and operational targets as well as an element based 
on personal and departmental objectives. A bonus of 67% of 
the maximum was awarded to the Chief Financial Officer, 
Andrew Findlay, in respect of the 2017 financial year. This 
reflects the strong company performance versus the profit, 
cost, personal and departmental objectives set at the outset of 
the year. However, no bonus was earned in respect of the 
on-time performance and customer satisfaction scores which 
fell just below the threshold set by the Committee. One-third 
of the bonus earned is subject to compulsory deferral into 
shares for three years. As noted above, Carolyn McCall is not 
eligible to receive a bonus in respect of the 2017 financial year.
LTIP
An LTIP award made to the Chief Financial Officer on 
recruitment in November 2015 is due to vest in December 
2017. The award is based on a combination of average return 
on capital employed (ROCE) performance (including lease 
adjustments) and relative total shareholder return (TSR) 
compared to FTSE 31-130 companies for the three financial 
years ended 30 September 2017. The Group achieved 
three-year average ROCE performance (including lease 
adjustments) of 16.2% but TSR was below median. This 
resulted in 15.3% of the awards vesting, subject to continued 
employment to the vesting date. LTIP awards made to Carolyn 
McCall in December 2014 and due to vest in December 2017 
have now lapsed as a result of her resignation.
REVIEW OF THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
POLICY
In advance of the expiry of the Group’s approved policy at the 
next AGM, the Committee has undertaken a thorough review 
of the current arrangements and has concluded that the 
existing approach remains effective and aligned with easyJet’s 
strategic objectives as set out on page 11.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration 
framework ensures there is significant alignment between the 
interests of Executive Directors and shareholders, focuses 
executives on safely delivering easyJet’s key strategic 
objectives and incorporates features which contribute to an 
appropriate level of risk mitigation. For example, incentive pay 
is subject to recovery and withholding provisions, a post-
vesting holding period operates for LTIP awards and significant 
share ownership guidelines apply.
We are not, therefore, proposing any fundamental changes to 
the policy. However, we are recommending some minor 
amendments to increase flexibility, enhance clarity and further 
strengthen alignment with shareholders’ interests. The key 
change is in relation to the LTIP, where we are proposing to 
introduce greater flexibility in the selection of measures and 
weightings to ensure that targets are fully aligned with the 
strategic imperatives prevailing at the time they are set.

GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report / continued
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION 
POLICY IN THE 2018 FINANCIAL YEAR
We will be taking the following approach to implementation  
of the remuneration policy for the year ending  
30 September 2018:
SALARY
Johan Lundgren’s salary on appointment will be £740,000.  
As previously reported, Andrew Findlay’s salary was set at 
£425,000 on appointment, with a stated intention to increase 
this in phases to £500,000 over time. Last year, this was 
increased to £462,500 and this year the Committee has 
decided to increase Andrew Findlay’s salary to £500,000. This 
represents the final step in this process and will complete the 
transition to the appropriate level. Carolyn McCall’s salary will 
remain at its current level until her employment ends.
BONUS
The Committee has set appropriate and stretching annual 
bonus targets for the year ended 30 September 2018 based 
on headline profit before tax and key operational, financial and 
personal targets. One-third of any bonus earned will continue 
to be subject to compulsory deferral into shares for three 
years.
 LTIP
In order to provide a balance between growth and returns that 
reflects our financial goals more closely, the Committee is 
consulting with major shareholders and shareholder advisory 
groups on the introduction of an earnings per share (EPS) 
measure to operate alongside the current ROCE and relative 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measures in the LTIP. We 
believe that the combination of these three measures will 
focus our executive team on sustainable growth of the 
business (EPS), maintain a disciplined approach to use of 
capital (ROCE), and align executive remuneration to growth  
in sustainable shareholder value (TSR).
The Committee will fully disclose finalised targets at the earliest 
opportunity. 
On behalf of the Committee I thank you for your continued 
support. We trust that you find the report informative and, as 
always, I welcome any comments you may have.

WHAT IS IN THIS REPORT?
This Report sets out easyJet’s remuneration policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors, describes the 
implementation of that policy and discloses the amounts earned relating to the year ended 30 September 2017. 
The Report complies with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and supporting regulations. The Report has been 
prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the requirements of the UK LA 
Listing Rules.
The Directors’ remuneration policy (set out on pages 69 to 75) will be put to shareholders in a binding vote at the 
forthcoming AGM and, if approved, will formally supersede the previous policy with immediate effect. The Annual 
Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee (set out on pages 65 to 66) and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration (set out on pages 75 to 84) will together be subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM.

REWARD PRINCIPLES
The Committee’s primary objective is to design a remuneration framework which promotes the long-term success of the Group. 
To this end, we are guided by the following reward principles which remain unchanged:
Principle Application in remuneration framework
Simple & cost  
effective
To establish a simple and cost-effective reward package in line with our low-cost and efficient business 
model. For example, our Executive Directors do not receive the level of benefits that can be found in the 
majority of listed companies and instead are aligned with those in the wider employee population.
Aligned with business 
strategy
To support the achievement of our business strategy of growth and returns, performance is assessed 
against a range of financial, operational, and longer-term targets. This ensures that value is delivered to 
shareholders and that Executive Directors are rewarded for the successful and sustained delivery of the 
key strategic objectives of the Group.
Pay for performance Total remuneration closely reflects performance and is therefore more heavily weighted towards variable

68 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 This part of the Directors’ remuneration report sets out 
easyJet’s directors’ remuneration policy. This revised policy 
will be put to shareholders for approval in a binding vote at 
the AGM on 8 February 2018. The effective date of the revised 
policy, if approved, will also be 8 February 2018. The 
Committee’s current intention is that the revised policy will 
operate for the three year period to the AGM in 2021.
ROLE OF OUR REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for 
determining remuneration for the Executive Directors and 
the Chairman of the Board. The Committee also reviews the 
remuneration of the Group’s most senior executives in 
consultation with the Chief Executive. The Committee takes 
into account the need to recruit and retain executives and 
ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the 
long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders, 
while paying no more than is necessary.
CONSIDERATIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE 
REMUNERATION POLICY
The primary objective of the Group’s remuneration policy  
is to promote the long-term success of the Group through the 
operation of competitive pay arrangements which are 
structured so as to be in the best interests of shareholders. 
When setting the policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
the Committee takes into account total remuneration levels 
operating in companies of a similar size and complexity, the 
responsibilities of each individual role, individual performance 
and an individual’s experience. Our overall policy, having had 
due regard to the factors noted, is to weight remuneration 
towards variable pay. This is typically achieved through  
setting base pay at a competitive level, offering very  
modest pension and benefits, and with the potential to earn 
above-market variable pay subject to the achievement of 
demanding performance targets linked to the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
In setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes note of the overall approach to reward for 
employees in the Group. Salary increases will ordinarily be  
(in percentage of salary terms) no higher than those of the 
wider workforce. The Committee does not formally consult 
directly with employees on executive pay but does receive 
periodic updates from the Group People Director.
The Committee also considers developments in institutional 
investors’ best practice expectations and the views expressed 
by shareholders during any dialogue.
CONSIDERING THE VIEWS OF SHAREHOLDERS 
WHEN DETERMINING THE REMUNERATION 
POLICY
easyJet remains committed to shareholder dialogue and takes 
an active interest in voting outcomes. We consult extensively 
with our major shareholders when setting our remuneration 
policy or when considering any significant changes to our 
remuneration arrangements. The Committee also considers 
shareholder feedback received in relation to the Directors’ 
remuneration report each year following the AGM. This, plus 
any additional feedback received from time to time, is then 
considered as part of the Committee’s annual review of 
remuneration policy and its implementation. 
CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS REMUNERATION 
POLICY (APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS AT THE 
2015 AGM)
The Committee has undertaken a thorough review of the 
existing remuneration policy, taking full account of easyJet’s 
strategic objectives and developments in the external pay 
environment. The Committee firmly believes that the current 
overarching remuneration policy continues to be effective and 
that no significant changes are required. However, some minor 
amendments have been proposed in order to ensure that the 
policy is sufficiently flexible to operate effectively over the next 
three-year period and provide additional clarity on how we 
operate our policy in some areas. Specifically, the policy 
incorporates additional flexibility with regard to the specific 
measures and weightings which will be used for the LTIP to 
ensure that any measures and targets are fully aligned with 
the strategic imperatives prevailing at the time they are set.
Directors’ remuneration policy

GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report / continued
SUMMARY OF THE REMUNERATION STRUCTURE
The table below sets out the main components of easyJet’s remuneration policy:
Element, purpose
and link to strategy
 
Operation (including maximum levels where applicable)
 Framework used to assess 
performance and provisions 
for the recovery of sums paid
Salary
To provide the core reward 
for the role.
Sufficient level to recruit  
and retain individuals of  
the necessary calibre to 
execute the Group’s business 
strategy.
 Base salaries are normally reviewed annually, with changes typically 
effective from 1 January.
Salaries are typically set after considering salary levels in companies  
of a similar size and complexity, the responsibilities of each individual 
role, progression within the role, individual performance and an 
individual’s experience. Our overall policy, having had due regard to 
the factors noted, is normally to target salaries at a broadly market 
competitive level.
Salaries may be adjusted and any increase will ordinarily be  
(in percentage of salary terms) no higher than those of the  
wider workforce.
Increases beyond those granted to the wider workforce (in 
percentage of salary terms) may be awarded in certain circumstances 
such as where there is a change in responsibility, progression in the 
role, experience or a significant increase in the scale of the role and/or 
size, value and/or complexity of the Group.
 The Committee considers 
individual salaries at the 
appropriate Committee 
meeting each year after 
having due regard to 
the factors noted in 
operating the 
salary policy. 
No recovery provisions 
apply to salary.
Benefits
In line with the Group’s 
policy to keep remuneration 
simple and consistent.
 Executive Directors receive benefits provisions at similar levels as the 
wider UK workforce. Benefits will typically include, for example, 
modest death in service cover. The cost to the Group of providing 
these benefits may vary from year-to-year depending on the level of 
the associated premium.
Executive Directors typically receive no other conventional executive 
company benefits but will be eligible for any other benefits which are 
introduced for the wider workforce on broadly similar terms.
Other benefits such as relocation allowances (and other incidental 
associated expenses) may be offered if considered appropriate and 
reasonable by the Committee.
Executive Directors can pay for voluntary benefits, where Group 
purchasing power may provide an advantage to employees.
Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in any all-employee 
share plans operated by the Company, in line with HMRC guidelines 
currently prevailing (where relevant), on the same basis as for other 
eligible employees.
Should it be appropriate to recruit a Director from overseas, flexibility 
is retained to provide benefits that take account of those typically 
provided in their country of residence (e.g. it may be appropriate to 
provide benefits that are tailored to the unique circumstances of such 
an appointment as opposed to providing the benefits detailed above).
Necessary expenses incurred undertaking Group business are 
reimbursed so that Executive Directors are not worse off on a net of 
tax basis for fulfilling Group duties.
 Not applicable.
No recovery provisions 
apply to benefits.
Pension
To provide employees with 
long-term savings via pension 
provisions in line with the 
Group’s strategy to keep 
remuneration simple and 
consistent.
 Defined contribution plan with the same monthly employer 
contributions as those offered to eligible employees in the wider UK 
workforce (i.e. up to 7% of base salary); or a cash alternative to the 
equivalent value less employers’ National Insurance contribution costs.
easyJet operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement whereby 
individuals can exchange part of their salary for Group paid pension 
contributions. Where individuals exchange salary this reduces 
employer National Insurance contributions. easyJet credits half of this 
reduction (currently 6.9% of the salary exchanged) to the individual’s 
pension plan.
 Not applicable.
No recovery provisions 
apply to employer 
pension contributions.
70 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Element, purpose 
and link to strategy
 
Operation (including maximum levels where applicable)
 Framework used to assess performance and provisions 
for the recovery of sums paid
Share ownership
To ensure alignment between 
the interests of Executive 
Directors and shareholders.
 The Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer are expected to build and maintain a 
holding equivalent to 200% and 175% of salary 
respectively over a period of five years  
from appointment.
Executive Directors are expected to retain 50% 
of the post-tax shares vesting under the LTIP 
and 100% of the post-tax deferred bonus 
shares until the guideline is met and keep it 
maintained thereafter.
 Not applicable.
Annual bonus
To incentivise and recognise 
execution of the business 
strategy on an annual basis. 
Rewards the achievement 
of annual financial and 
operational goals.
Compulsory deferral provides 
alignment with shareholders.
 Maximum opportunity of 200% of salary for 
Chief Executive and 175% of salary for other 
Executive Directors.
One-third of the pre-tax bonus earned is 
subject to compulsory deferral into shares (or 
equivalent), typically for a period of three years, 
and is normally subject to continued 
employment.
The remainder of the bonus is paid in cash.
Dividend equivalent payments may be made on 
the deferred bonus, at the time of vesting and 
may assume the reinvestment of dividends.
All bonus payments are at the discretion of  
the Committee, as shown following this table.
 Bonuses are based on stretching financial, 
operational and personal/departmental 
performance measures, as set and assessed  
by the Committee in its discretion, with 
performance normally measured over a 
one-year period. Financial measures (e.g. 
headline profit before tax) will represent the 
majority of bonus, with other measures 
representing the balance. A graduated scale  
of targets is set for each measure, with 10%  
of each element being payable for achieving 
the relevant threshold hurdle.
Safety underpins all of the operational activities 
of the Group and the bonus plan includes a 
provision that enables the Remuneration 
Committee to scale back the bonus earned 
(including to zero) in the event that there is a 
safety event which it considers warrants the 
use of such discretion.
The annual bonus plan includes provisions 
which enable the Committee (in respect of 
both the cash and the deferred elements of 
bonuses) to recover or withhold value in the 
event of certain defined circumstances. 
LTIP Performance Share 
Award
To incentivise and recognise 
execution of the business 
strategy over the longer-term. 
Rewards strong financial 
performance and sustained 
increase in shareholder value.
 Each year LTIP awards may be granted subject 
to the achievement of performance targets. 
Awards normally vest over a three-year period.
The maximum opportunity contained within the 
plan rules for Performance Share Awards is 
250% of salary (with awards up to 300% of 
salary eligible to be made in exceptional 
circumstances, such as recruitment).
The normal maximum face value of annual 
awards will be 250% of salary for the Chief 
Executive and 200% of salary for other 
Executive Directors.
Dividend equivalent awards may be made on 
LTIP awards that vest, and may assume the 
reinvestment of dividends. 
A holding period applies to share awards 
granted in the financial year ended 30 
September 2015 and beyond. The holding 
period will require the Executive Directors to 
retain the after-tax value of shares for 24 
months from the vesting date.
 LTIP awards currently vest based on 
performance against a challenging range of 
financial targets and relative TSR performance 
set and assessed by the Committee in its 
discretion. Financial targets currently determine 
vesting in relation to at least 50% of awards. 
The selection of measures and weightings may 
be varied for future award cycles as appropriate 
to reflect the strategic priorities of the business 
at that time.
Performance is normally measured over a 
three-year period.
A maximum of 25% of each element vests for 
achieving the threshold performance target 
with 100% of the awards being earned for 
maximum performance. 
The LTIP includes provisions which enable the 
Committee to recover or withhold value in the 
event of certain defined circumstances.

GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report / continued
DISCRETION RETAINED BY THE COMMITTEE IN 
OPERATING THE INCENTIVE PLANS
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and LTIP 
according to their respective rules (or relevant documents) 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules where relevant. The 
Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, 
in a number of regards to the operation and administration of 
these plans. These include, but are not limited to, the following 
in relation to the LTIP and annual bonus deferred in shares:
• the participants;
• the timing of grant of an award;
• the size of an award;
• the determination of vesting;
• the payment vehicle of the award/payment;
• discretion required when dealing with a change of control 
or restructuring of the Group;
• determination of the treatment of leavers based on the 
rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights 
issues, corporate restructuring events and special 
dividends); and
• the annual review of performance measures and weighting, 
and targets for the LTIP from year-to-year.
In relation to the annual bonus plan, the Committee retains 
discretion over:
• the participants;
• the timing of grant of a payment;
• the determination of the bonus payment;
• dealing with a change of control;
• determination of the treatment of leavers based on  
the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment 
chosen; and
• the annual review of performance measures and weighting, 
and targets for the annual bonus plan from year-to-year.
In relation to both the Company’s LTIP and annual bonus plan, 
the Committee retains the ability to adjust the targets and/or 
set different measures if events occur which cause it to 
determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate (e.g. 
material acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business), 
and the amendment is required so that the conditions 
achieve their original purpose and are not materially less 
difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would be explained in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration and may be the subject of 
consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
The use of discretion in relation to the Company’s Save As You 
Earn and Share Incentive Plans will be as permitted under 
HMRC rules and the Listing Rules.
Details of share awards granted to existing Executive 
Directors are set out on page 79 of the Annual Report. These 
remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.
 
PERFORMANCE METRICS AND TARGET SETTING
The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the 
annual bonus plan reflect the Committee’s belief that any 
incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging 
and tied to the delivery of a blend of key financial, operational 
and personal targets intended to ensure that Executive 
Directors are incentivised to deliver across a scorecard of 
objectives for which they are accountable. Financial measures 
(e.g. headline profit before tax) will be used for the majority of 
the bonus and will be selected in order to provide a clear 
indication of how successful the Group has been in managing 
operations effectively overall (e.g. in maximising profit per seat 
whilst maintaining a high load factor). The remainder of the 
bonus will be based on key operational (e.g. on-time 
performance and customer satisfaction) and personal or 
departmental measures set annually. 
Since safety is of central importance to the business, the 
award of any bonus is subject to an underpin that enables the 
Remuneration Committee to reduce the bonus earned 
(including to zero) in the event that there is a safety event that 
it considers warrants the use of such discretion.
LTIP awards are earned for delivering performance against 
an appropriate balance of key long-term financial (e.g. ROCE 
and EPS) and relative TSR targets. These seek to assess the 
underlying financial performance of the business while 
maintaining clear alignment between shareholders and 
Executive Directors. Targets are set based on a sliding scale 
that takes account of relevant commercial factors.
Only modest awards are available for delivering threshold 
performance levels with maximum awards requiring substantial 
outperformance of challenging plans.
The Committee has retained some flexibility on the specific 
measures which can be used for the annual bonus plan and 
the LTIP to ensure that they will be fully aligned with the 
strategic imperatives prevailing at the time they are set.
No performance targets are set for Save As You Earn awards 
since these are purposefully designed to encourage employees 
across the Group to purchase shares in the Company. A 
measure of Group performance is used in determining awards 
under the Share Incentive Plan.
HISTORICAL AWARDS
All historical awards that were granted under any current or 
previous share schemes operated by the Company, and which 
remain outstanding, remain eligible to vest on the basis of their 
original award terms.
DIFFERENCES IN PAY POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS COMPARED TO OTHER EASYJET 
EMPLOYEES
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more 
heavily weighted towards variable and share-based pay than 
for other employees, to make a greater part of their pay 
conditional on the successful delivery of business strategy. 
This aims to create a clear link between the value created for 
shareholders and the remuneration received by the Executive 
Directors. However, in line with the Group’s policy to keep 
remuneration simple and performance-based, the benefit and 
pension arrangements for the current Executive Directors are 
on the same terms as those offered to eligible employees in 
the wider workforce. All employees have the opportunity to 
participate in the tax-advantaged share plans.
72 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 ILLUSTRATION OF HOW MUCH THE EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS COULD EARN UNDER THE 
REMUNERATION POLICY
A significant proportion of remuneration is linked to 
performance, particularly at maximum performance levels. The 
charts below show how much the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer could earn under easyJet’s remuneration 
policy under different performance scenarios in the 2018 
financial year. The following assumptions have been made:
• Minimum (performance below threshold) – Fixed pay only 
with no vesting under any of easyJet’s incentive plans.
• In line with expectations – Fixed pay plus a bonus at the 
mid-point of the range (giving 50% of the maximum 
opportunity) and vesting of 50% of the maximum under 
the LTIP.
• Maximum (performance meets or exceeds maximum) – 
Fixed pay plus maximum bonus and maximum vesting 
under the LTIP.
Fixed pay comprises:
• salaries – salary effective as at 1 October 2017 (or on 
appointment for the Chief Executive);
• benefits – amount received in the 2017 financial year 
(estimated for the new Chief Executive);
• pension – employer contributions or cash-equivalent 
payments received in the 2017 financial year (the level on 
appointment for the Chief Executive); and
• Free and Matching Shares under the all-employee share 
incentive plan.
It should be noted that since the analysis above shows what 
could be earned by the Executive Directors based on the 
remuneration policy described above (ignoring the potential 
impact of share price growth), the numbers will be different to 
the values included in the table on page 77 detailing what was 
actually earned by the Executive Directors in relation to the 
financial year ended 30 September 2017, since these values 
are based on the actual levels of performance achieved to  
30 September 2017 and include the impact of share price 
growth in relation to share awards.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ TERMS OF 
EMPLOYMENT
The Group’s policy is for Executive Directors to have  
service contracts which may be terminated with no more than 
12 months’ notice from either party.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for 
inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
APPROACH TO LEAVERS
If notice is served by either party, the Executive Director can 
continue to receive basic salary, benefits and pension for the 
duration of their notice period during which time the Business 
may require the individual to continue to fulfil their current 
duties or may assign a period of garden leave.
A payment in lieu of notice may be made and, in this event, 
the Committee’s normal policy is to make the payment in up 
to 12 monthly instalments which may be reduced if alternative 
employment was taken up during this period. 
Bonus payments may be made, payable in cash, on a  
pro-rata basis, but only for the period of time served from  
the start of the financial year to the date of termination and 
not for any period in lieu of notice. Any bonus paid would be 
subject to the normal bonus targets, tested at the end of the 
financial year.
In relation to a termination of employment, the Committee 
may make any statutory entitlements or payments to settle 
or compromise claims in connection with a termination of 
any existing or future Executive Director as necessary. 
The Committee also retains the discretion to reimburse 
reasonable legal expenses incurred in relation to a termination 
of employment and to meet any outplacement costs if 
deemed necessary.
The rules of our share plans set out what happens to awards  
if a participant ceases to be an employee or Director of 
easyJet before the end of the vesting period. Generally, any 
outstanding share awards will lapse on such cessation, except 
in certain circumstances.
If an Executive Director ceases to be an employee or Director 
of easyJet as a result of death, injury, retirement, the sale of 
the business or company that employs the individual, or any 
other reason at the discretion of the Committee, then they will 
be treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the relevant plan’s rules. 
Under the deferred bonus, the shares for a good leaver will 
normally vest in full on the normal vesting date (or on 
cessation of employment in the case of death) and if the 
award is in the form of an option, there is a 12-month window 
in which the award can be exercised. Awards structured as 
options which have vested prior to cessation can be exercised 
within 12 months of cessation of office or employment.

GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report / continued
Under the LTIP, a good leaver’s unvested awards will vest 
(either on the normal vesting date or the relevant date of 
cessation, as determined by the Committee) subject to 
achievement of any relevant performance conditions, with a 
pro-rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the vesting 
period served. The Committee has the discretion to disapply 
time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do so. A good 
leaver may exercise their vested awards structured as options 
for a period of 12 months following the individual’s cessation  
of office or employment, whereas unvested awards may be 
exercised within 12 months of vesting.
In determining whether an Executive Director should be 
treated as a good leaver, and the extent to which their award 
may vest, the Committee will take into account the 
circumstances of an individual’s departure.
In the event of a takeover or winding-up of easyJet plc (which 
is not part of an internal reorganisation of the easyJet Group, 
in circumstances where equivalent replacement awards are 
not granted) all awards will vest subject to, in the case of LTIP 
awards, the achievement of any relevant performance 
conditions with a pro-rata reduction to reflect the proportion 
of the vesting period served. The Committee has discretion to 
disapply time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do so. 
In the event of a takeover, the Committee may determine, 
with the agreement of the acquiring company, that awards  
will be exchanged for equivalent awards in another company.
POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Executive Directors are permitted to accept appropriate 
outside Non-Executive Director appointments so long as the 
overall commitment is compatible with their duties as Executive 
Directors and is not thought to interfere with the business of 
the Group. Any fees received in respect of these appointments 
are retained directly by the relevant Executive Director.
APPROACH TO DETERMINING REMUNERATION 
ON RECRUITMENT
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with easyJet’s 
remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and 
calibre of the individual. Where it is considered appropriate to 
offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to achieve the 
desired salary positioning may be given over the following few 
years to reflect progression in the role, subject to individual 
performance. Benefits will normally be provided in line with 
those offered to other employees. The Committee may provide 
an allowance and/or reimbursement of any reasonable 
expenses in relation to the relocation of an Executive Director. 
easyJet may also offer a cash amount on recruitment, payment 
of which may be staggered, to reflect the value of benefits a 
new recruit may have received from a former employer.
Should it be appropriate to recruit a Director from overseas, 
flexibility is retained to provide benefits that take account of 
those typically provided in their country of residence (e.g. it 
may be appropriate to provide benefits that are tailored to the 
unique circumstances of such an appointment).
The maximum level of variable pay that may be offered on an 
ongoing basis and the structure of remuneration will be in 
accordance with the approved policy detailed above, i.e. at an 
aggregate maximum of up to 450% of salary (200% annual 
bonus and 250% Performance Shares under the LTIP), taking 
into account annual and long-term variable pay. This limit does 
not include the value of any buy-out arrangements. Any 
incentive offered above this limit would be contingent on the 
Company receiving shareholder approval for an amendment to 
its approved policy. Different performance measures may be 
set initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the 
responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial 
year that they joined. LTIP awards can be made shortly 
following an appointment (assuming the Company is not in 
a closed period).
The above policy applies to both an internal promotion to the 
Board or an external hire.
In the case of an external hire, if it is necessary to buy out 
incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which would be 
forfeited on leaving the previous employer), this would be 
provided for taking into account the form (cash or shares), 
timing and expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any 
existing performance criteria) of the remuneration being 
forfeited. Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted 
using easyJet’s share plans to the extent possible, although 
awards may also be granted outside these schemes if 
necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal promotion, any outstanding variable 
pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be paid 
according to its terms of grant (adjusted as relevant to take 
into account the Board appointment).
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, fees will be set taking into account the experience 
and calibre of the individual. Where specific cash or share 
arrangements are delivered to Non-Executive Directors,  
these will not include share options or other performance-
related elements.
The Board evaluation and succession planning processes in 
place are designed to ensure there is the correct balance of 
skills, experience and knowledge on the Board. The activities of 
the Nominations Committee overseeing these matters are 
disclosed in the Nominations Committee report.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
The Non-Executive Directors receive an annual fee (normally 
paid in monthly instalments). The fee for the Non-Executive 
Chairman is set by the Remuneration Committee and the fees 
for the other Non-Executive Directors are approved by the 
Board, on the recommendation of the Chairman and  
Chief Executive.
TERMS OF APPOINTMENT OF THE 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The terms of appointment of the Chairman and the other 
Non-Executive Directors are recorded in letters of 
appointment. The required notice from the Company is three 
months. The Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any 
compensation on loss of office.
The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are 
available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s 
registered office.

 The Chairman is paid an all-inclusive fee for all Board responsibilities.
The other Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, with supplementary fees 
payable for additional Board Committee responsibilities.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s 
incentive arrangements.
Fee levels are reviewed on a regular basis, and may be increased, taking into account 
factors such as the time commitment of the role and market levels in companies of 
comparable size and complexity.
Flexibility is retained to exceed current fee levels if it is necessary to do so in order to 
appoint a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director of an appropriate calibre.
In exceptional circumstances, if there is a temporary yet material increase in the time 
commitments for Non-Executive Directors, the Board may pay extra fees to recognise 
the additional workload.
Necessary expenses incurred undertaking Group business will be reimbursed so that the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not worse off, on a net of tax basis, for 
fulfilling Company duties.
No other benefits or remuneration are provided to the Chairman or Non-Executive Directors.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
As at 30 September 2017, the members of the  
Committee were:
• Charles Gurassa (Chair)
• Adèle Anderson
• Moya Greene (appointed to the Committee effective  
20 September 2017)
• Andy Martin
François Rubichon stepped down from the Board and the 
Committee on 22 July 2017.
The responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the 
Corporate Governance section of the Annual report on  
page 64.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive attend meetings by 
invitation and assist the Committee in its deliberations as 
appropriate. The Committee also receives assistance from the 
Group People Director and the Group Head of Reward. The 
Company Secretary and the Group General Counsel acts as 
secretary to the Committee. No Directors are involved in 
determining their own remuneration.
APPLICATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY 
FOR THE 2018 FINANCIAL YEAR
There will be no material changes to the remuneration policy 
or its implementation for the 2018 financial year. easyJet’s 
remuneration policy has received consistently high levels of 
investor support over time and the Committee considers that 
it remains aligned with the best practice expectations of 
institutional investors. 
Base salary
The current and proposed salaries of the Executive  
Directors are:

Change
Johan Lundgren £740,000 £740,000 – 
 Carolyn McCall n/a £705,600 n/a 
Andrew Findlay £500,000 £462,500 8% 
(1) or on appointment if later
Johan Lundgren’s salary has been set at £740,000 from 
appointment on 1 December 2017. The salary will not be 
reviewed before 1 January 2019. Andrew Findlay’s base salary 
was set at £425,000 when he joined the Board in October 
2015. The salary was set at a significant discount to the market 
level with the intention that it would be brought up to the 
mid-market level (£500,000) over time to reflect progression 
in the role. The increase effective 1 January 2018, to £500,000 
is the final stage in this process and was subject to an 
assessment of individual and Business performance.
For comparison, the typical rates of salary increase to be 
awarded to employees in Group functions is 1% to 3%.
ANNUAL BONUS IN RESPECT OF PERFORMANCE 
IN THE 2018 FINANCIAL YEAR
The maximum bonus opportunity remains at 200% of salary 
for the new Chief Executive (Carolyn McCall will not participate 
in the annual bonus for the 2018 financial year) and at 175% for 
the Chief Financial Officer. The measures have been selected 
to reflect a range of financial and operational goals that 
support the key strategic objectives of the Group.
75 www.easyJet.com
GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report / continued
The performance measures and weightings will be as follows:
 
As a percentage of maximum
bonus opportunity
Measure CEO CFO
Headline profit before tax  
(at budgeted constant currency) 60% 60%
On-time performance 10% 10%
Customer satisfaction 10% 10%
Headline costs per seat excluding 
fuel at budgeted constant currency 10% 10%
Personal and departmental 
objectives 10% 10%
The proposed target levels for the 2018 financial year have 
been set to be challenging relative to the business plan.
The Committee is comfortable that the bonus targets for both 
Executive Directors are appropriately demanding in light of 
their respective bonus opportunities.
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2018 financial 
year, are commercially sensitive. However, retrospective 
disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be 
provided in next year’s remuneration report unless they remain 
commercially sensitive at that time. The safety of our 
customers and people underpins all of the operational activities 
of the Group and the bonus plan includes a provision that 
enables the Remuneration Committee to scale back the bonus 
awarded in the event that a safety event has occurred, which 
it considers warrants the use of such discretion. One-third of 
the pre-tax bonus earned will be deferred into shares for a 
period of three years and will be subject 
to continued employment.
The annual bonus includes provisions which enable the 
Remuneration Committee to recover or withhold value from 
any recipient of a cash or deferred bonus share award in the 
event of a material misstatement of results for the financial 
year to which the awards related, or an error in determining 
the size of a bonus, within three years of the payment of the 
cash bonus or the vesting of the deferred bonus shares. The 
Remuneration Committee may also recover or withhold value 
from any recipient of an award of deferred bonus shares in 
situations where the individual is considered to have 
contributed to any safety failure which could result in 
reputational damage for the Business.
LTIP AWARDS IN RELATION TO THE 2018 
FINANCIAL YEAR
We intend to make an award to the Chief Executive of 250% 
of salary and to the Chief Financial Officer of 200% of salary in 
respect of the 2018 financial year. Carolyn McCall will not 
participate in the LTIP for the 2018 financial year. 
In order to provide a balance between growth and returns that 
reflects our financial goals the Committee is seeking feedback 
from major shareholders and shareholder advisory groups on 
the introduction of an EPS measure to operate alongside the 
current ROCE and TSR measures in the LTIP. The finalised 
targets will be fully disclosed at the earliest opportunity. 
A post-vesting holding period requiring the Executive Directors 
to retain the after tax value of any shares for two years from 
the vesting date will continue to apply to awards made in the 
2018 financial year.
The LTIP includes provisions which enable the Committee to 
recover or withhold value in certain events within three years 
of the vesting. These include misstatement of results or a 
calculation error used in assessing the number of shares under 
an award or the extent to which any performance condition 
was met or in situations where the individual is considered to 
have contributed to any safety failure which could result in 
reputational damage for the Business.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
The fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will be 
as follows:
Chairman £300,000
Basic fee for other Non-Executive Directors £60,000
Fees for Deputy Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director role
(1)
£25,000
Chair of the Audit, Safety and 
Remuneration Committees
(1)
£15,000
Chair of the Finance Committee
(1)
£10,000
(1) Supplementary fees.
The Board has agreed that there will be no increase to the 
basic fees for the 2018 financial year; these are reviewed 
regularly and were last increased on 1 October 2013.

(3) Customer satisfaction measures the percentage of our passengers that are ‘Quite satisfied’, ‘Very satisfied’ or ‘Completely satisfied’ at last contact.
(4) An outstanding performance assessment has been awarded to Andrew Findlay to recognise his performance against the departmental objectives set at 
the outset of the year.  Specifically, these relate to a number of projects designed to maintain the strength of the balance sheet and progress on various 
strategic, M&A, commercial and organistational change projects. The payout awarded was therefore at the maximum for this element of bonus (17.5% 
of salary).
77 www.easyJet.com
GOVERNANCE Directors’ remuneration report / continued
A sliding scale of financial and operational targets for each objective was set at the start of the 2017 financial year. 10% of each 
element is payable for achieving the threshold target, increasing to 50% for on-target performance and 100% for achieving 
maximum performance. Achievements between these points are calculated on a straight-line basis.
Despite continued challenging business conditions during the year financial performance (headline profit before tax and headline 
cost per seat) was ahead of target but below the maximum level of performance set by the Committee at the outset of the 
year. In contrast, given a number of external factors including rising congestion in key airports, OTP and CSAT performance did 
not achieve the threshold required to trigger a bonus. In recognition of the performance of the Chief Financial Officer against a 
range of personal and departmental objectives, the Committee decided to make a maximum payment to the Chief Financial 
Officer for this element of bonus. In total, therefore, 67% of the maximum bonus was awarded to the Chief Financial Officer in 
respect of performance for the year ended 30 September 2017 resulting in a bonus payment of £528,344. One-third of the 
bonus is compulsorily deferred into shares for three years and subject to continued employment. As noted earlier in this report 
Carolyn McCall will no longer be eligible to receive a bonus in respect of the 2017 financial year or the 2018 financial year.
The Committee is satisfied with the overall payments in light of the level of performance achieved.
LTIP (AUDITED)
The awards vesting in respect of the performance period to 30 September 2017 were subject to a combination of average ROCE 
(including lease adjustments) and relative TSR compared to FTSE 31-130 companies performance conditions measured over the 
three financial years ended 30 September 2017. The percentage which could be earned was determined using the following 
vesting schedule:
 
Below threshold
(0% vesting)
Threshold
(25% vesting)
On Target
(40% vesting)
Maximum
(100% vesting)
ROCE awards    
(50% of total awards) Below 15% 15% 18.2% 20% or above
TSR awards    
(50% of total awards) Below median Median Upper Quartile
Three-year average ROCE (including lease adjustments) to 30 September 2017 was 16.2% and the Company did not meet the 
threshold TSR performance target. In the case of the Chief Financial Officer, this will result in 15.3% of the maximum LTIP award 
vesting in December 2017, subject to continued service. The LTIP awards made to Carolyn McCall in December 2014 have lapsed.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE AND PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS (AUDITED)
No payments for loss of office or to past Directors have been made during the year.

Note 1: The number of shares is calculated according to the scheme rules of individual plans based on the middle-market closing share price of the day prior

price following announcement of the half year results.
Note 2: For LTIP awards made in December 2012, 50% of vesting was based on three-year average ROCE (including lease adjustment) performance for the 
three financial years ending 30 September 2015. This was the first award where ROCE calculations included operating leases and this is the basis for all 
subsequent awards. 50% of vesting was based on relative TSR performance compared to companies ranked FTSE 51-150. Three year average ROCE 
(including lease adjustments) was 20.0% and the Company was ranked at the 94th percentile versus FTSE 51-150 companies in terms of TSR; 
correspondingly 100% of these awards vested in December 2015. The following targets applied for these awards:

In addition, the TSR awards will not vest unless there has been positive TSR over the performance period. The face value of the awards granted was 
£1,763,995 (250% of salary) to Carolyn McCall and £924,995 (200% of salary) to Andrew Findlay.
Note 7: An award of 22,762 easyJet shares was made to compensate Andrew Findlay for the forfeiture of the LTIP award he was awarded in August 2013 
from his previous employer. Since around two-thirds of the vesting period for this award had already run its course, the Committee assessed the extent to 
which the performance targets were likely to be met (based on current market forecasts) in respect of the shares comprising two-thirds of the award and 
converted this number of shares into an equivalent value of easyJet shares on joining. These vested on 7 August 2016, so as to mirror the original time 
horizon of the award.
Note 8: An award of 14,625 easyJet shares relating to the forfeiture of the LTIP Andrew Findlay was awarded in August 2013 from his previous employer. 
This award was calculated based on the value of one-third of the award at the time of joining easyJet, but these shares will only vest to the extent that the 
performance targets set for the 2013 easyJet LTIP award (as provided in Note 3 above) are met and continued employment to 17 December 2016. This 
compensation replicated the assessed value of the awards forfeit and also, in part, switched into easyJet performance on a pro-rata basis for part 
of the award.
Note 9: An award of 39,923 easyJet shares was made to compensate for the forfeiture of the award granted to Andrew Findlay in August 2014 from his 
previous employer. This award comprised an exchange of the maximum number of shares that could vest under his previous employer’s award which were 
then converted to easyJet shares on joining. These shares will only vest based on the extent to which the performance targets applying to the 2014 easyJet 
LTIP award (as provided in Note 4 above) are met and Andrew remaining in employment until 19 December 2017, being the ordinary vesting date for the 
easyJet award and later than the vesting date of the original award at his former employer.
Note 10: Participants buy Partnership Shares monthly under the Share Incentive Plan. The Company provides one Matching Share for each Partnership Share 
purchased, up to the first £1,500 per year. These Matching Shares are first available for vesting three years after purchase.
 
80 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES IN THE 2018 FINANCIAL YEAR
The shareholding guidelines will continue to operate on broadly the same basis as last year, i.e. the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer are expected to build up a shareholding of 200% and 175% of salary, respectively over the first five years from 
appointment to the Board. Until the guideline is met Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of net vested shares from the 
LTIP and 100% of net vested deferred bonus shares. Similarly, the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman of the Board, 
are required to build up a shareholding of 100% of annual fees over a period of three years from appointment.

POSITION AGAINST DILUTION LIMITS
easyJet complies with the Investment Association’s Principles of Remuneration with regard to dilution limits. These principles 
require that commitments under all of the Company’s share incentive schemes must not exceed 10% of the issued share capital 
in any rolling 10 year period. Share awards under all current share incentive schemes (LTIP, Save As you Earn and Share Incentive 
Plan) will be satisfied with share purchases on the market and the Company’s current position against its dilution limit is within the 
maximum 10% limit.
EMPLOYEE SHARE PLAN PARTICIPATION
A key component of easyJet’s reward philosophy is to provide share ownership opportunities throughout the Group by making 
annual awards of performance-related shares to all eligible employees. In addition, easyJet operates a voluntary discounted share 
purchase arrangement for all employees via a Save As You Earn scheme and a Buy As Your Earn arrangement with matching 
shares in the UK under the tax approved Share Incentive Plan.

ADVISORS TO THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is advised by New Bridge Street (NBS), (a trading name of Aon plc). NBS was appointed by the 
Committee in 2004 following a tender process. NBS advises the Committee on developments in executive pay and on the 
operation of easyJet’s incentive plans. Other than to the Committee, NBS also provides some associated advice to easyJet in 
relation to, for example, legal implementation and the fees of the Non-Executive Directors. Other than the provision of these 
services, NBS has no other connection with the Company. However, a sister company in the Aon group also provides pension 
and flexible benefits administration services to the Company. Total fees (excluding VAT) paid to NBS in respect of services to  
the Committee during the 2017 financial year were £136,490, charged on a time and materials basis. NBS is a signatory to the 
Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct and any advice received is governed by that code. The Committee has 
reviewed the operating processes in place at NBS and is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective.

The Annual report and accounts have been drawn up and 
presented in accordance with UK company law and the 
liabilities of the Directors in connection with the report shall be 
subject to the limitations and restrictions provided by such law.
easyJet plc is incorporated as a public limited company and 
is registered in England with the registered number 3959649. 
easyJet plc’s registered office is Hangar 89, London Luton 
Airport, Luton, Bedfordshire, LU2 9PF. The Company’s 
registrars are Equiniti Limited who are situated at Aspect

POLITICAL DONATIONS AND EXPENDITURE
easyJet works constructively with all levels of government 
across its network, regardless of political affiliation. easyJet 
believes in the rights of individuals to engage in the 
democratic process, however it is easyJet’s policy not 
to make political donations.
There were no political donations made or political expenditure 
incurred during the 2017 financial year (2016: £2,056). The 
expenditure incurred in 2016 was in relation to a visit by David 
Cameron to easyJet’s headquarters. This constituted political 
expenditure under the Companies Act 2006, as it involved the 
prime minister campaigning for the EU referendum.
DIVIDEND
The Directors are recommending an ordinary dividend, with a 
pay-out ratio of 50% of headline profit after tax, resulting in a 
dividend of £162 million or 40.9 pence per share. The ordinary 
dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 8 February 2018.
APPOINTMENT AND RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS
Subject to applicable law, a Director may be appointed by 
an ordinary resolution of shareholders in a general meeting 
following nomination by the Board or a member (or members) 
entitled to vote at such meeting, or following retirement by 
rotation if the Director chooses to seek re-election at a general 
meeting. In addition, the Directors may appoint a Director to 
fill a vacancy or as an additional Director, provided that the 
individual retires at the next Annual General Meeting. A 
Director may be removed by the Company as provided for by 
applicable law, in certain circumstances set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association (for example bankruptcy or 
resignation), or by an ordinary resolution of the Company in a 
general meeting. All Directors stand for election at the Annual 
General Meeting following their appointment, and stand for 
re-election on an annual basis.
POWERS CONFERRED ON THE DIRECTORS IN 
RELATION TO ISSUING OR BUYING BACK SHARES
Subject to applicable law and the Company’s Articles of 
Association the Directors may exercise all powers of the 
Company, including the power to authorise the issue and/or 
market purchase of the Company’s shares (subject to an 
appropriate authority being given to the Directors by 
shareholders in a general meeting and any conditions 
attaching to such authority). The shareholders delegated the 
following powers in relation to the issuing or market purchase 
by the Company of its shares at the Company’s 2017 Annual 
General Meeting:
i. authority to allot equity securities with a nominal value of 
up to approximately 10% of its issued share capital;
ii. authority to allot equity securities, without first offering 
them to existing shareholders in proportion to their 
holdings, with a nominal value of up to approximately 5% 
of its issued share capital; and
iii. authority to make market purchases of its own shares, up 
to a maximum of approximately 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital.
These standard authorities will expire on 9 May 2018, or at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2018, whichever is 
the earlier. The Directors will seek to renew the authorities at 
the Annual General Meeting in 2018. As at 20 November 2017, 
none of these authorities had been exercised.
During the 2017 financial year, no ordinary shares in the 
Company were issued.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
Directors’ and officers’ insurance cover has been established 
for all Directors to provide cover against their reasonable 
actions on behalf of the Company. A deed was executed in 
2007 indemnifying each of the Directors of the Company and/
or its subsidiaries as a supplement to the Directors’ and 
officers’ insurance cover. The indemnities, which constitute a 
qualifying third party indemnity provision as defined by section 
234 of the Companies Act 2006, were in force during the 2017 
financial year and remain in force for all current and past 
Directors of the Company.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which 
they have, or may have, interests that conflict with those of 
easyJet, unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. 
The Company has in place procedures for managing conflicts 
of interest. The Company’s Articles of Association also contain 
provisions to allow the Directors to authorise potential conflicts 
of interest so that a Director is not in breach of his/her duty 
under company law. Should a Director become aware that he/ 
she has an interest, directly or indirectly, in an existing or 
proposed transaction with easyJet, he/she should notify the

SHARE CAPITAL AND RIGHTS ATTACHING TO 
SHARES
Details of the authorised and issued share capital during the 
year are provided in note 18 to the accounts on page 115.
On 30 September 2017, there was a single class of 397,208,133 
ordinary shares of 27 2/7 pence in issue, each with one vote. 
There were no shares held in treasury at that date.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in its Articles of Association. Holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled, subject to any applicable law and 
the Company’s Articles of Association, to:
• have shareholder documents made available to them, 
including notice of any general meeting;
• attend, speak and exercise voting rights at general 
meetings, either in person or by proxy; and
• participate in any distribution of income or capital. 
VOTING RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON 
TRANSFER OF SHARES
None of the ordinary shares carry any special rights with 
regard to control of the Company. There are no restrictions  
on transfers of shares other than:
• certain restrictions which may from time to time be 
imposed by laws or regulations such as those relating to 
insider dealing;
• pursuant to the Company’s Share Dealing Code, whereby 
the Directors and designated employees require approval 
to deal in the Company’s shares;
• where a person with an interest in the Company’s shares 
has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests 
in those shares;
• where a proposed transferee of the Company’s shares has 
failed to furnish to the Directors a declaration of nationality 
(together with such evidence as the Directors may require) 
as required by the Company’s Articles of Association; and
• the powers given to the Directors by the Company’s 
Articles of Association to limit the ownership of the 
Company’s shares by non-UK nationals and powers to 
enforce this limitation including the right to force a sale  
of any affected shares.
There are no restrictions on exercising voting rights save in 
situations where the Company is legally entitled to impose 
such a restriction (for example under the Articles of 
Association where amounts remain unpaid in the shares after 
request, or the holder is otherwise in default of an obligation to 
the Company). The Company is not aware of any 
arrangements between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.
EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – RIGHTS OF 
CONTROL
The trustee of the easyJet UK Share Incentive Plan (the Plan) 
will, on receipt of any offer, compromise, arrangement or 
scheme which affects ordinary shares held in the Plan, or in 
relation to any resolutions proposed at a general meeting 
(including the Annual General Meeting), invite participants to 
direct the trustee on the exercise of any voting rights 
attaching to the ordinary shares held by the trustee on their 
behalf and/or direct how the trustee shall act in relation to 
those ordinary shares. The trustee shall take no action in 
respect of ordinary shares for which it has received no 
direction to vote, or ordinary shares which are unallocated. On 
a poll, the trustee shall vote in accordance with directions 
given by participants. In the absence of directions, or on a 
show of hands, the trustee shall not vote.
The trustee of the easyJet plc Employee Benefit Trust (the 
Trust), which is used to acquire and hold shares in the 
Company for the benefit of employees, including in connection 
with the easyJet Long Term Incentive Plan, the International 
Share Incentive Plan and Sharesave plans, has the power to 
vote or not vote, at its absolute discretion, in respect of any 
shares in the Company held unallocated in the Trust. However, 
in accordance with good practice, the trustee adopts a policy 
of not voting in respect of such shares.
Both the trustees of the easyJet UK Share Incentive Plan and 
the easyJet plc Employee Benefit Trust have a dividend waiver 
in place in respect of shares which are the beneficial property 
of each of the trusts.
AMENDMENT OF THE ARTICLES OF 
ASSOCIATION
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended 
by a special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders.
CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS
The following significant agreements which were in force at  
20 November 2017 take effect, alter or terminate on a change 
of control of the Company.
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or 
employee that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from a change of control on takeover, 
except that provisions of the Company’s share schemes and 
plans may cause options and awards granted to employees 
under such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover.
Revolving Credit Facility
The Company is party to a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) 
which contains change of control provisions. The effect of a 
change of control would be that unless otherwise agreed by 
the Company and the agent of the lenders:
• a lender would not be obliged to fund a utilisation of  
the facility;
• the commitment of the lenders would be cancelled; and
• all amounts accrued would become immediately due 
and payable.
As at 20 November 2017 no amounts had been drawn down 
under the RCF.
EMTN Programme and Eurobond issue
On 7 January 2016, the Group established a Euro Medium Term 
Note Programme (the “EMTN Programme”) which provides the 
Group with a standardised documentation platform to allow for 
senior unsecured debt issuance in the Eurobond markets. The 
maximum potential issuance under the EMTN Programme is 
£3 billion. Under the EMTN Programme, in February 2016, the 
Company issued Eurobonds consisting of €500 million

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
auditors of the Company will be put to shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT WITH 
CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS
Any person who exercises or controls on their own or together 
with any person with whom they are acting in concert, 30%  
or more of the votes able to be cast on all or substantially  
all matters at general meetings of a Company are known as 
‘controlling shareholders’. The Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules require companies with controlling shareholders 
to enter into a written and legally binding agreement which is 
intended to ensure that the controlling shareholder complies 
with certain independence provisions. The agreement must 
contain undertakings that:
a. transactions and arrangements with the controlling 
shareholder (and/or any of its associates) will be 
conducted at arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms;
b. neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will take any action that would have the effect of 
preventing the listed company from complying with 
its obligations under the Listing Rules; and
c. neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder 
resolution which is intended or appears to be intended 
to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
 The Board confirms that, in accordance with the Listing Rules, 
on 14 November 2014, the Company entered into such an 
agreement with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou (easyJet’s founder) and 
easyGroup Holdings Limited, an entity in which Sir Stelios holds 
a beneficial interest and which holds shares in the Company on 
behalf of Sir Stelios (the ‘Relationship Agreement’). Under the 
terms of the Relationship Agreement, Sir Stelios and 
easyGroup Holdings Limited have agreed to procure the 
compliance of Polys and Clelia Haji-Ioannou with the 
independence obligations contained in the Relationship 
Agreement. Sir Stelios, easyGroup, Polys and Clelia Haji-
Ioannou together comprise controlling shareholders of the 
Company who have a combined total holding of approximately 
33% of the Company’s voting rights.
The Board confirms that, since the entry into the Relationship 
Agreement on 14 November 2014 until 20 November 2017, 
being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this 
Annual report and accounts:
i. the Company has complied with the independence 
provisions included in the Relationship Agreement;

GOVERNANCE Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the accounts in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Company accounts in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group 
and the Company for that period. In preparing these accounts, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
 The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the accounts 
and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group accounts, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of, amongst other things, the financial and corporate 
governance information provided on the easyJet website 
(http://corporate.easyJet.com). Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s and the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
on pages 48 and 49, confirm that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
• the Group and Company accounts, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group and Company; and
• the Strategic report, included in the Annual report, includes 
a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
it faces.
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, 
each Director in office at the date the Directors’ report is 
approved, confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
• he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
The Annual report on pages 1 to 88 was approved by the 
Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 20 November 
2017 and signed on its behalf by:

88 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion, easyJet plc’s consolidated Group financial 
statements and Company financial statements (the  
‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 
the Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit and the Group’s and the Company’s cash 
flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the 
Company’s financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements, included within the 
Annual report, which comprise: the Group and Company 
statements of financial position as at 30 September 2017; the 
Group income statement and statement of comprehensive 
income, the Group and Company statements of cash flows, 
and the Group and Company statements of changes in equity 
for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial 
statements, which include a description of the significant 
accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the  
Audit Committee.
Independent auditors’ report to the members of easyJet plc
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas of 
focus
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in  
the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that 
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in the Corporate governance 
report, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group 
or the Company in the period from 1 October 2016 to  
30 September 2017.
Our audit approach
The Group operates through the Company and its nine 
subsidiary undertakings, of which six are trading, as set out  
on page 129 and the Group financial statements are a 
consolidation of these entities. The accounting for these 
entities is largely centralised in the UK and our audit scope 
comprises an audit of the financial information for four of the 
trading subsidiaries. These procedures gave us the evidence 
that we needed for our opinion on the Group’s financial 
statements as a whole.
Materiality
Overall Group materiality: £19.3 million (2016: £24.7 million), based on 5% of profit before tax.
Overall Company materiality: Would amount to £25 million (2016: £21 million), based on 1% of total 
assets, however, this has been capped at £19.3 million in line with the Group materiality level above.
Audit scope
The Group operates through the Company and its nine subsidiaries; and the Group financial statements 
are a consolidation of these entities. The accounting for these entities, along with the Group 
consolidation, is largely centralised in the UK. Our audit scope comprises an audit of the financial 
information of four of the trading subsidiaries and the Company.
Key audit matters
• Aircraft maintenance provision (Group).
• Fair value of derivative instruments (Group and Company).
• EU 261 provision (Group).
• Goodwill and landing rights impairment assessment (Group).
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit  
of the financial statements of the current period and include  
the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any 
comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,  
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Overview
89 www.easyJet.com
GOVERNANCE  Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Aircraft maintenance provision (Group)  
The Group operates aircraft which are owned or held under 
finance or operating lease arrangements and incurs liabilities for 
maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating 
leases during the term of the lease. These arise from legal and 
contractual obligations relating to the required condition of the 
aircraft when it is returned to the lessor.
Maintenance provisions of £284 million for aircraft maintenance 
costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases were 
recorded in the accounts at 30 September 2017.
At each balance sheet date, the calculation of the maintenance 
provision includes a number of variable factors and assumptions 
including: likely utilisation of the aircraft; the expected cost of the 
heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to occur; the 
condition of the aircraft; and the lifespan of life-limited parts.
We focus on this area because of the inherent level of 
management judgement required in calculating the amount  
of provision needed as a result of the complex and subjective 
elements around these variable factors and assumptions.
 We evaluated the maintenance provision model and tested 
calculations therein. This included assessing the process by which 
the variable factors within the provision are estimated, evaluating 
the reasonableness of the assumptions, testing the input data 
and re-performing calculations.
In particular, we challenged the key assumptions using the 
Group’s internal data, such as business plans and maintenance 
contract terms and previously settled invoices. We also 
performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of the 
model. We found no material exceptions from these assessments 
and comparisons.
Having ascertained the magnitude of movements in those key 
assumptions, that either individually or collectively would be 
required for the provision to be misstated, we considered the 
likelihood of such movements arising and any impact on the 
overall level of aircraft maintenance provisions recorded in the 
accounts. Our assessment as to likelihood and magnitude did  
not identify any material exceptions.
Fair value of derivative instruments (Group and Company)  
Given the nature of the business, the Group and the Company 
make use of derivative financial instruments. Forward contracts 
are used to hedge transaction currency risk (comprising fuel, 
leasing and maintenance US dollar payments), jet fuel price risk, 
and Euro and Swiss franc revenue receipts.
At 30 September 2017, the Group’s derivative financial assets 
amounted to £218 million and derivative financial liabilities were  
£126 million.
We focus on these balances because of their materiality to the 
financial position of the Group and the Company, the volume of 
transactions passing through the respective accounts and the 
number of counterparties involved.
 We evaluated and assessed the processes, procedures and 
controls in respect of treasury and other management functions 
which directly impact the relevant account balances and 
transactions. We tested management’s year end account 
reconciliation process. The results of this work allowed us to focus 
on substantiating the year end positions recorded in the financial 
statements. We did not identify any material exceptions.
We independently obtained third party confirmations from 
counterparties of the year end positions. We assessed the 
appropriateness of hedge accounting for the derivative financial 
instruments and tested, using independent data-feeds, the fair 
values being ascribed to those instruments at the year end. These 
procedures did not identify any material exceptions.
We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the 
financial statements in respect of both non-derivative and 
derivative financial instruments. Based on our work, we 
considered the disclosures to be appropriate.
EU 261 provision (Group)  
The Group records a provision for EU 261 compensation payable 
in respect of flight delays and cancellations. At 30 September 
2017 this provision was £25.9 million.
We focus on this area because of the inherent level of judgement 
required estimating this provision.
 We tested and challenged the reasonableness of the key 
assumptions underlying the EU 261 provision which included:
• passenger claim history;
• current levels of passenger claims;
• flight disruptions; and
• time periods over which the assessment is made.
We tested the input data of the EU 261 provision, reperformed 
the underlying calculations, traced settled claims to cash 
payments and performed sensitivity analysis over the key  
drivers of the provision. We found no material exceptions from  
these procedures.
Having ascertained the magnitude of movements in those key 
assumptions that, either individually or collectively, would be 
required for the provision to be materially misstated, we 
considered the likelihood of such movements arising and any 
impact on the overall level of judgemental provisions recorded  
in the financial statements. Our assessment as to likelihood and 
magnitude did not identify any material exceptions.
Independent auditors’ report to the members of easyJet plc / continued
90 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017  Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Goodwill and landing rights impairment assessment  
(Group)
  
Goodwill arises from acquisitions in previous years and has an 
indefinite expected useful life. Landing rights (which are an 
intangible asset) are considered by management to have an 
indefinite useful life as they will remain available for use for the 
foreseeable future. Goodwill and landing rights are tested for 
impairment at least annually at the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) 
level. The Group has one CGU, being its route network. As at 30 
September 2017, they amounted, in aggregate, to £459 million 
(refer to notes 1 and 9 to the accounts).
We focus on this assessment as the impairment test involves a 
number of subjective judgements and estimates by management, 
many of which are forward-looking. These estimates include key 
assumptions surrounding the strategic plan, fuel prices, exchange 
rates, long-term economic growth rates and discount rates.
 We evaluated and challenged the future cash flow forecasts of 
the CGU, and the process by which they were drawn up, and 
tested the underlying value in use calculations. In doing this, we 
compared the forecast to the latest Board approved plans.
We also challenged the key assumptions for fuel prices, exchange 
rates and long-term growth rates in the forecasts by comparing 
them to economic and industry forecasts; and the discount rate  
by assessing the Group’s cost of capital. We found no material 
exceptions from our work.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions 
above to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions 
that, either individually or collectively, would be required for the 
goodwill and landing rights to be impaired.
We found no material exceptions from this analysis.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which they operate.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
  Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £19.3 million (2016: £24.7 million). £19.3 million (2016: £21 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 1% of total assets, capped at group 
materiality.
Rationale for benchmark applied We have applied this benchmark,  
a generally accepted auditing practice,  
in the absence of indicators that  
an alternative benchmark would  
be appropriate.
 We have applied this benchmark,  
a generally accepted auditing practice,  
in the absence of indicators that  
an alternative benchmark would  
be appropriate.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.  
The range of materiality allocated across components was between £930,000 and £19,250,000. Certain components were 
audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above  
£0.96 million (2016: £1.2 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.

GOVERNANCE  Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or 
draw attention to in respect of the Directors’ statement in the 
financial statements about whether the Directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval  
of the financial statements.
 We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s  
and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to 
going concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
 We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered whether the 
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 (CA06) have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, CA06, ISAs (UK) and the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below 
(required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
STRATEGIC REPORT AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and 
Directors’ report for the year ended 30 September 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements (CA06).
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors’ report (CA06).
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (on pages 47 to 64) about internal controls and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes 
and about share capital structures in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
sourcebook of the FCA (‘DTR’) is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements (CA06).
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in this information (CA06).
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (on pages 47 to 64) with respect to the Company’s Corporate Governance Code and practices and about its 
administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the  
DTR (CA06).
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared 
by the Company (CA06).
THE DIRECTORS’ ASSESSMENT OF THE PROSPECTS OF THE GROUP AND OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT WOULD THREATEN 
THE SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY OF THE GROUP
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
The Directors’ confirmation on page 88 of the Annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Independent auditors’ report to the members of easyJet plc / continued
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
92 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 The disclosures in the Annual report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
The Directors’ explanation on page 31 of the Annual report as to 
how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to 
be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the 
Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement 
in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review 
was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted 
of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are  
in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and the Company and their 
environment obtained in the course of the audit (Listing Rules).
OTHER CODE PROVISIONS
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to 
report when: 
The statement given by the Directors, on page 88, that they 
consider the Annual report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for 
the members to assess the Group’s and the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and the Company 
obtained in the course of performing our audit.
The section of the Annual report on pages 59 to 62 describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing 
Rules, for review by the auditors.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report  
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 (CA06).
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 88, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance 
with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for 
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations,  
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the  
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  
on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of  
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:

received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or
• the Company’s financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee,  
we were appointed by the members on 22 February 2006  
to audit the financial statements for the year ended

Notes to the accounts 
www.easyJet.com 99 
1. Accounting policies, judgements and estimates 
Statement of compliance 
easyJet plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘easyJet’ or the ‘Group’ as applicable) are a low-cost airline carrier operating 
principally in Europe. The Company is a public limited company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under the 
ticker symbol EZJ and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is Hangar 89, 
London Luton Airport, Luton, Bedfordshire, LU2 9PF. 
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union, taking into account IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRSIC) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.   
Basis of preparation 
The accounts are prepared based on the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities including 
derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value.  
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these accounts. 
easyJet’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are described in the 
Strategic report on pages 2 to 46. Principal risks and uncertainties are described on pages 34 to 40. Note 23 to the accounts sets 
out the Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for managing its capital and gives details of the risks related to financial 
instruments held by the Group. 
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. Details on going concern are provided on page 31. 
The use of critical accounting estimates and management judgement is required in applying the accounting policies. Areas involving 
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are 
highlighted on pages 105 to 106. 
Changes in accounting policies 
During the year, a change was made to the accounting policy in respect of the presentation of headline and non-headline items (see 
Critical accounting judgements and estimates section). This provides a relevant and reliable measure for assessing the underlying 
trading performance of the business by identifying material non-recurring items or items which are not considered to be reflective of 
the trading performance of the business. This presentational change has been made for the first time in the current year, and the 
comparative financial statements have been restated. 
Where an aircraft is sold and leased back, other than when first delivered to easyJet, a liability to undertake future maintenance 
activities, resulting from past flying activity, arises at the point the lease agreement is signed. Historically this liability has been treated 
as part of the surplus or shortfall arising on the sale and leaseback and recognised in either deferred income or non-current or 
current assets as appropriate and amortised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.  
During the year, the accounting policy was changed to recognise the initial maintenance provision on sale and leasebacks 
immediately in the income statement. The new accounting policy will result in an accounting treatment which better reflects the 
economics of the lease arrangements. 
This change requires a restatement of previous financial statements. 
The following table sets out the adjustments made to certain line items of the previously reported comparative amounts as a result 
of the change to the initial maintenance provision catch-up on sale and leasebacks accounting policy.

Significant accounting policies 
The significant accounting policies applied are summarised below. They have been applied consistently to both years presented. The 
explanations of these policies focus on areas where judgement is applied or which are particularly significant in the financial 
statements. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyJet plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 September 2016 and 2017. 
A full list of subsidiaries can be found in the Notes to the Company accounts on page 129. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyJet plc. Control is achieved when easyJet is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power, directly or indirectly, over 
the investee. 
Intragroup balances, transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated accounts. 
Foreign currencies 
The primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency. The consolidated accounts 
of easyJet are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest £million, which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s 
presentation currency. Certain subsidiaries have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than Sterling. Exchange 
differences arising on the translation of these foreign operations are taken to shareholders’ equity until all or part of the interest is 
sold, when the relevant portion of the accumulated exchange gains or losses is recognised in the income statement. Profits and 
losses of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange during the year, since this approximates the 
rates on the dates of the transactions.  
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the end of a 
reporting period and (except where the asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge) the gains or losses on translation are 
included in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling 
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected.  
Revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises seat revenue, being the value of airline services (net of air passenger duty and similar charges, VAT and 
discounts), and non-seat revenue.
100 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017  
 
www.easyJet.com 101 
Seat revenue arises from the sale of flight seats, including the provision of checked baggage, allocated seating, administration, credit 
card and change fees. Seat revenue is recognised when the service is provided. This is generally when the flight takes place but, in 
the following cases, this is at the time of booking: 
• administration and credit card fees as they are contractually non-refundable; and 
• change fees as the service provided is that of allowing customers to change bookings. 
Amounts paid by ‘no-show’ customers are recognised as seat revenue when the booked service is provided as such customers are 
not generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed. 
Unearned revenue represents flight seats, including the provision of checked baggage and allocated seating, sold but not yet flown 
and is held in the statement of financial position until it is realised in the income statement when the service is provided. 
Non-seat revenue arises from commissions earned from services sold on behalf of partners and is recognised when the service is 
provided. This is generally when the related flight takes place. In the case of commission earned from travel insurance, revenue is 
recognised at the time of booking as easyJet acts solely as appointed representative of the insurance company. 
Business combinations 
Business combinations in prior years were accounted for by applying the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed plus any costs directly 
attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date.  
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over easyJet’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. It has an indefinite expected useful life and is tested for 
impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment. 
Landing rights are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. They are considered to have an indefinite useful life as 
they will remain available for use for the foreseeable future provided minimum utilisation requirements are observed, and are tested 
for impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment. 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated to write off their cost, less estimated 
residual value, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually. 
 Expected useful life 
Computer software 3-7 years 
Contractual rights Over the length of the related contracts 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, 
less estimated residual value, of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Expected useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed annually. 
 Expected useful life 
Aircraft 23 years 
Aircraft spares 14 years 
Aircraft – prepaid maintenance 7-10 years 
Leasehold improvements 5-10 years or the length of lease if shorter 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 years or length of lease of property where equipment is used if shorter 
Computer hardware 3-5 years 
Aircraft held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their expected useful lives, as 
shown above.  
Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market rates at the end of the reporting period for 
equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates are adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis. The carrying value is reviewed for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For aircraft, easyJet is 
dependent on Airbus as its sole supplier. This gives rise to a valuation risk which crystallises when aircraft exit the fleet, where 
easyJet is reliant on the future demand for second-hand aircraft.  
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is depreciated over a period 
ranging from seven to ten years from the date of manufacture. Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future 
periods, such as long-term scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines, are capitalised and depreciated 
over the length of period benefitting from these enhancements. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.

Note to the accounts continued 
 
102 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 
1. Accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued 
Pre-delivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft are recorded in property, plant and equipment at cost. These amounts 
are not depreciated. Interest attributed to pre-delivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft and other qualifying assets 
under construction are capitalised and added to the cost of the asset concerned. 
Gains and losses on disposals (other than aircraft sale and leaseback transactions) are determined by comparing the net proceeds 
with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.  
Other non-current assets  
Payments for aircraft and engine maintenance, as stipulated in the respective operating lease agreements, have historically been 
made to some lessors as security for the performance of future heavy maintenance works. The payments are recorded within 
current and non-current assets (as applicable) as receivables from the lessors until the respective maintenance event occurs and the 
reimbursement with the lessor is finalised. Any payment that is not expected to be reimbursed by the lessor is recognised 
immediately within operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair 
value less cost to sell and its value in use. Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses recognised 
on assets other than goodwill are only reversed where changes in the estimates used result in an increase in recoverable amount.  
Leases 
easyJet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells either new or mid-life aircraft to a third party and immediately 
leases them back. Where sale proceeds received are judged to reflect the aircraft’s fair value, any gain or loss arising on disposal is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Where sale proceeds received do not represent the aircraft’s fair value, any 
shortfall or surplus arising is deferred within non-current assets or liabilities respectively, and amortised in the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.  
In some operating sale and leaseback arrangements, receipt of part of the proceeds is deferred until the end of the lease, the 
amount of which is recorded as deferred consideration within non-current or current assets as appropriate.  
Non-contingent operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. A 
number of operating leases require easyJet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates; these are 
expensed as incurred.  
Finance leases, which transfer to easyJet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Any directly attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset 
recognised. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are included in interest payable and other 
financing charges.  
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are recognised when easyJet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and 
derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions. 
Where market values are not available, the fair value of financial instruments is calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.  
Non-derivative financial assets 
Non-derivative financial assets are recorded at amortised cost and include trade receivables, cash and money market deposits.  
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts with no access restrictions and bank deposits and tri-party 
repos repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception. Interest income on cash and money market deposits is 
recognised using the effective interest method. Restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing their 
use and is classified as a current or non-current asset based on the estimated remaining length of the restriction.  
Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that an impairment 
loss has been incurred. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.  
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that 
occurred after the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed. Both impairment losses and reversals 
are recognised in the income statement as components of net finance charges.  
Non-derivative financial liabilities 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently at 
amortised cost, and include trade and other payables, borrowings and provisions. Interest expense on borrowings is recognised 
using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the reporting period date. 
102 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
easyJet uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency risks on transactions denominated in US 
dollars, Euros, Swiss francs and South African rand. These transactions primarily affect revenue, fuel and aircraft dry leasing costs, 
and the carrying value of owned aircraft. easyJet also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge currency and interest rate 
risk on certain borrowings, and jet fuel forward contracts to hedge fuel price risks.  
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied to those derivative financial instruments that 
are designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.  
Fair value hedges 
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, 
together with any changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash flow hedges 
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of forward contracts are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
deferred in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are determined to be effective. All other changes in fair value are 
recognised immediately in the income statement.  
When the hedged forecast transaction relates to an item of property, plant and equipment, the relevant accumulated gains and 
losses are transferred from the hedging reserve and included in the initial carrying amount of that purchased asset. Otherwise they 
are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects the income statement. 
In the event that a hedged forecast transaction is no longer considered highly probable, any related gains and losses are 
immediately transferred from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised (e.g. through expiry or disposal), or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. Where the hedged item remains a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain 
deferred in the hedging reserve until the transaction takes place. 
Financial guarantees 
If a claim on a financial guarantee given to a third party becomes probable, the obligation is recognised at fair value. For subsequent 
measurement, the carrying amount is the higher of initial measurement and best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date. 
Tax 
Tax expense in the income statement consists of current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except when 
it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or shareholders’ equity, in which case it is recognised 
in other comprehensive income or shareholders’ equity. The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted 
for income that is exempt and expenses that are not deductible using tax rates that are applicable to the taxable income.   
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, where it is 
probable that the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future, with the 
following exceptions: 
• where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit; and 
• deferred tax arising on investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where easyJet is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of assets and settlement of 
liabilities are expected to take place, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the statement of 
financial position. 
Deferred tax assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, losses and tax 
credits carried forwards.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits 
from which they can be deducted.  
Deferred tax liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions 
The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned and finance-leased 
aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.  
easyJet has contractual obligations to maintain aircraft held under operating leases. Provisions are created over the term of the 
lease based on the estimated future costs of major airframe checks, engine shop visits and end of lease liabilities. These costs are 
discounted to present value.

1. Accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued 
Where an aircraft is sold and leased back, other than when first delivered to easyJet, a maintenance catch-up liability resulting from 
past flying activity arises at the point the lease agreement is signed and a corresponding maintenance provision catch-up is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
A number of leases also require easyJet to pay recoverable supplemental rent to the lessor. The purpose of these payments is to 
provide the lessor with collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition that does not meet the requirements of the lease. 
This recoverable supplemental rent is included in trade and other receivables within current assets and other non-current assets, as 
applicable, and is refunded when qualifying heavy maintenance is performed, or is offset against the costs incurred at the end of 
the lease.  
Other provisions 
Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Amounts 
provided for represent the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, 
taking into account all related risks and uncertainties.  
Provision is made for passenger compensation claims when the Group has an obligation to recompense customers under Flight 
Compensation Regulation 261/2004. Provisions are measured based on known eligible events, passengers impacted and historical 
claim rates. 
Employee benefits 
easyJet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees. easyJet has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of easyJet in 
independently administered funds. easyJet’s contributions are charged to the income statement in the year in which they 
are incurred. 
The expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related employees’ services are provided. 
Share capital and dividend distribution 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.  
Where any Group company or employee benefit trust purchases the Company’s equity shares, the consideration paid and any 
directly attributable incremental costs are deducted from retained earnings until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Proceeds 
from re-issue are shown as a credit to retained earnings. 
easyJet settles share awards under the Long Term Incentive, the Save As You Earn scheme, Restricted Share Plan and Share 
Incentive Plans by purchasing its own shares on the market through employee benefit trusts. The cost of such purchases is 
deducted from retained earnings in the period that the transaction occurs. 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved 
by the Company’s shareholders. 
Share-based payments 
easyJet has a number of equity-settled share incentive schemes. The fair value of share options granted under the Save As You 
Earn scheme is measured at the date of grant using the Binomial Lattice option pricing model. The fair value of grants under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan is measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model for awards based on ROCE performance 
targets, and the Stochastic model (also known as the Monte Carlo model) for awards based on TSR performance targets. The fair 
value of all other awards is the share price at the date of grant.  
The fair value of the estimated number of options and awards that are expected to vest is expensed to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period that employees’ services are rendered, with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity. 
Where non-market performance criteria (such as ROCE) attached to the share options and awards are not met, any cumulative 
expense previously recognised is reversed. For awards with market-related performance criteria (such as TSR), an expense is 
recognised irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied.  
The social security obligations payable in connection with grant of the share options are an integral part of the grant itself and the 
charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction.  
Segmental disclosures 
easyJet has one operating segment, being its route network, based on management information provided to the Executive 
Management Team, which is easyJet’s chief operating decision maker. Resource allocation decisions are made for the benefit of the 
route network as a whole, rather than for individual routes within the network. Performance of the network is assessed based on the 
consolidated profit or loss before tax for the year.  
Revenue is allocated to geographic segments on the following bases: 
• revenue earned from passengers is allocated according to the location of the first departure airport on each booking; and 
• commission revenue earned from partners is allocated according to the domicile of each partner.

Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of 
income and expenses during the reporting period. Although these amounts are based on management’s best estimates, events or 
actions may mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material. The estimates 
and the underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly. 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the 
Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised and presented in the financial statements. 
Classification of operating and financing leases (Notes 10 and 24) 
Management exercises judgement in determining the classification of leases as either finance or operating leases in nature at 
inception of the lease. Management considers the likelihood of exercising break clauses or extension options in determining the lease 
term. Where the lease term constitutes substantially all of the economic life of the asset, or where the present value of minimum 
lease payments amount to substantially all of the fair value of the aircraft, the lease is classified as a finance lease. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases. 
Classification of income or expenses between headline and non-headline items (Note 5) 
The Group seeks to present a measure of underlying performance which is not impacted by material non-recurring items or items 
which are not considered to be reflective of the trading performance of the business. This measure of profit is described as ‘headline’ 
and is used by the Directors to measure and monitor performance. The excluded items are referred to as ‘non-headline’ items.  
Non-headline items may include impairments, amounts relating to acquisitions and disposals, expenditure on major restructuring 
programmes, litigation and insurance settlements, balance sheet exchange gains or losses, the income or expense resulting from the 
initial recognition of sale and lease back transactions, fair value adjustments on financial instruments and other particularly significant 
or unusual non-recurring items. Items relating to the normal trading performance of the business will always be included within the 
headline performance. 
Judgement is required in determining the classification of items between headline and non-headline. 
Consolidation of easyJet Switzerland 
Judgement has been applied in consolidating easyJet Switzerland S.A. as a subsidiary on the basis that the Company exercises a 
dominant influence over the undertaking. A non-controlling interest has not been reflected in the consolidated accounts on the basis 
that holders of the remaining 51% of the shares have no entitlement to any dividends from that holding and the Company has an 
option to acquire those shares for a pre-determined minimal consideration. 
The following three critical accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or are areas where 
assumptions are significant to the financial statements: 
Aircraft maintenance provisions – £284 million (Note 17) 
easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases during the term of the lease. 
These arise from legal and constructive contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the 
lessor. To discharge these obligations, easyJet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the 
engines and the airframe during the lease term.  
A charge is made in the income statement, based on hours or cycles flown, to provide for the cost of these obligations. The most 
critical estimates required are considered to be the utilisation of the aircraft, the expected costs of the heavy maintenance checks at 
the time which they are expected to occur, the condition of the aircraft, the lifespan of life-limited parts and the rate used to 
discount the provision.  
The bases of all estimates are reviewed annually, and also when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material 
change to an estimate, such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, increased or decreased utilisation, or changes in the 
cost of heavy maintenance services.  
Other provisions – £38 million (Note 17) 
easyJet incurs liabilities for amounts payable to customers who make claims in respect of flight delays and cancellations, and 
refunds of air passenger duty or similar charges. Estimates include passenger claim rates, the value of claims made and the period of 
time over which claims will be made. The bases of all estimates are reviewed at least annually and also when information becomes 
available that is capable of causing a material change to the estimate. 
Goodwill and landing rights – £459 million (Note 9) 
Goodwill and landing rights are tested for impairment at least annually. easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route 
network. In making this assessment, easyJet has considered the manner in which the business is managed including the centralised 
nature of its operations and the ability to open or close routes and redeploy aircraft and crew across the whole route network.

1. Accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued 
The value in use of the cash-generating unit is determined by discounting future cash flows to their present value. When applying 
this method, easyJet relies on a number of key estimates including its ability to meet its strategic plans, future fuel prices and 
exchange rates, long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which it operates, and its pre-tax weighted average 
cost of capital. Both fuel price and exchange rates are volatile in nature, and the assumptions used are sensitive to significant 
changes in these rates. 
New and revised standards and interpretations not applied 
The following new or revised standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have not 
been applied in preparing these accounts as their effective dates fall in periods beginning on or after 1 October 2017 (and in some 
cases have not been endorsed by the EU). 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ – effective for the year ending 30 September 2019 
easyJet will adopt IFRS 15 on 1 October 2018 and anticipates applying the cumulative catch-up (“modified”) transition method.  
The standard provides a single model for measuring and recognising revenue arising from contracts with customers. It supersedes all 
existing revenue requirements in IFRS. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when customers obtain control of goods or services and 
so are able to direct the use, and obtain the benefits, of those goods or services.  
easyJet has reviewed all revenue streams as part of its IFRS 15 impact assessment. Whilst the majority of revenues are already 
recognised in line with the requirements of the new standard, revenue recognition from certain ancillary streams will be delayed from 
the date of booking to the date of flight. 
This change is expected to result in a higher proportion of annual revenues being recognised in the second half of the financial year. 
More specifically, under IAS 18, administration fees arising on bookings in the first half of the financial year for flights in the second 
half would be recognised in the first half of the year; under IFRS 15 these revenues will be recognised in the second half. 
The anticipated full year impact on adoption of the standard is expected to be immaterial. 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – effective for the year ending 30 September 2019 
easyJet will adopt IFRS 9 on 1 October 2018 and anticipates applying the standard prospectively with no retrospective adjustments 
required. 
The standard removes the multiple classification and measurement models for financial assets required by IAS 39 and instead 
introduces a model that has three classification categories: amortised cost; fair value through the Income Statement and fair value 
through Other Comprehensive Income. Classification of a debt asset instrument is driven by its cash flow characteristics and the 
business model in which the asset is held. Accounting for financial liabilities and for derecognising financial instruments under IFRS 9 
is materially consistent with that required by IAS 39. IFRS 9 adds new requirements to address the impairment of financial assets and 
hedge accounting. 
easyJet does not anticipate any material change in the classification or measurement of its financial instruments or in its hedging 
activities on adoption of the standard. 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – effective for the year ending 30 September 2020  
easyJet is currently planning to early adopt IFRS 16 on 1 October 2018, bringing the timing of adoption in line with that of IFRS 9 and 
IFRS 15. easyJet anticipates applying the cumulative catch-up (“modified”) transition method. 
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, specifying how leases are recognised, measured, presented and disclosed. 
Under IFRS 16, easyJet will capitalise all aircraft and properties currently held under operating leases. Operating lease expenses will be 
replaced by a depreciation expense on Right of Use assets recognised and an interest expense as the interest rate implicit in 
easyJet’s lease liabilities unwinds.  
At 30 September 2017 (excluding the impact of the post balance sheet Air Berlin transaction (see note 28) which has not yet been 
evaluated) easyJet anticipates that on adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 October 2018, it will recognise approximately £0.3 billion of lease 
liabilities and approximately £0.3 billion of Right of Use Assets. Annual operating lease expenses of £0.1 billion, which would have 
been recognised under the existing leases standard, will be replaced by anticipated similar levels of depreciation and interest 
expense such that no material impact on profit before tax is expected in the year of transition. 
Retained earnings are expected to decrease slightly on adoption of IFRS 16, reflecting the difference in carrying value between Right 
of Use assets and Lease Liabilities initially recognised.

Key assumptions used to calculate the impacts outlined above: 
• easyJet anticipates the continuation of its aircraft sale and leaseback programme prior to the date of transition; 
• a USD/GBP foreign exchange rate of 1.27/1 at the date of initial application and throughout year of initial application; and  
• based on current aircraft financing incremental borrowing rate estimates, calculations at the date of initial application use a 
discount rate of 2 per cent.

Sale and leaseback charge 
The sale and leaseback of the Group’s 10 oldest A319 aircraft resulted in a loss on disposal of the assets of £10 million, recognised 
within other costs in the income statement, and a £6 million maintenance provision catch-up, charged immediately to the income 
statement upon entering the lease, within maintenance costs. 
Organisational review  
The implementation of an organisational review has resulted in costs of £6 million, which have been recognised in other costs within 
the income statement. This programme, which involves redundancy costs and associated third party adviser fees, is considered a 
material non-recurring item by virtue of the estimated size of the whole programme.  
Air Operator Certificate (AOC) 
Following the UK’s referendum vote to leave the European Union (EU), easyJet is in the process of establishing a multi-AOC post-
Brexit structure, which included the set-up of an European AOC, based in Austria, in July 2017. The European AOC helps secure 
future flying rights for the 30% of easyJet’s network which remains wholly within and between EU member states. In the year ended 
30 September 2017 the Group incurred £2 million, primarily comprising set up costs, which have been recognised in other costs 
within the income statement.  
Maintenance reserves discounting 
In the year ended 30 September 2016 the maintenance provision was discounted for the first time, reflecting the time value of 
money. The discount applied generated a cumulative one-off non-headline income statement credit of £8 million. In the year ended 
30 September 2017 and for future periods the impact of discounting will be reflected as a headline item. 
Balance sheet foreign exchange gain  
Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from the retranslation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held in the 
statement of financial position resulted in a gain of £2 million, recognised within interest in the income statement. 
Fair value adjustment  
A £1 million charge was recognised relating to fair value adjustments associated with the cross-currency interest rate swaps put in 
place to hedge the bond issued in February 2016, recognised within interest in the income statement.

It is estimated that deferred tax liabilities of approximately £15 million (2016: deferred tax assets of £1 million) will reverse during the 
next financial year. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority. As a result the 
net UK deferred tax liability is £249 million (2016: £237 million). The net overseas deferred tax asset is £nil (2016: £nil).

No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be 
payable in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the Group. 
7. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the total profit for the year by the weighted average number of shares in 
issue during the year after adjusting for shares held in employee benefit trusts. 
To calculate diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion 
of all dilutive potential shares. Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of 
the Company’s ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares. Where share options are exercisable 
based on performance criteria and those performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the 
calculation of dilutive potential shares. 
Headline basic and diluted earnings per share are also presented, based on headline profit for the year.

easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network. The recoverable amount of goodwill and other assets with indefinite 
expected useful lives has been determined based on value in use calculations of the route network. 
Pre-tax cash flow projections have been derived from the forecast cash flows presented to the Board for the period up to 2022, 
using the following key assumptions: 
Pre-tax discount rate (derived from weighted average cost of capital) 10%
Fuel price (US dollars per metric tonne) 550 – 600
Exchange rates: 
US dollar  1.27 
Euro 1.10 
Swiss franc 1.25
Both fuel price and exchange rates are volatile in nature, and the assumptions used represent management’s view of reasonable 
average rates. Operating margins are sensitive to significant changes in these rates. 
Cash flow projections beyond the forecast period have been extrapolated using growth rate scenarios ranging from zero up to 
an estimated average of long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which easyJet operates. No impairment 
resulted from any of these scenarios. 
The impairment model is sensitive to a sustained significant adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. 
No reasonably possible combination of changes to the key assumptions above would result in the carrying value of the cash-
generating unit exceeding its recoverable amount.

Trade and other receivables of £19 million (2016: £24 million) are up to three months past due but not impaired. 
With respect to trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications at the reporting date that the 
payment obligations will not be met. Amounts due from trade receivables are short-term in nature and largely comprise credit card 
receivables due from financial institutions with credit ratings of at least A and, accordingly, the possibility of significant default is 
considered to be unlikely.

On 7 January 2016, the UK Listing Authority approved a prospectus relating to the establishment of a £3,000 million Euro Medium 
Term Note Programme of easyJet plc. Under this programme, in February 2016 easyJet plc issued notes amounting to €500 million 
for a seven year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.750% and in October 2016 easyJet plc issued notes amounting to €500 
million for a seven year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.125%. 
The €500 million Eurobond issued in February 2016 was designated as the hedged item in an effective fair value hedging 
relationship. The Group used cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate Eurobond to a Sterling floating rate 
exposure. The cross-currency interest rate swaps have the same maturity and common terms as the Eurobond that they are 
hedging. The carrying value of the fixed rate Eurobond net of cross-currency interest rate swaps at 30 September 2017 was £377 
million. See note 22 for additional details.

Long Term Incentive Plan 
The plan is open, by invitation, to Executive Directors and senior management, and provides for annual awards of Performance 
Shares worth up to 250% (200% up to 31 December 2014) of salary each year. For awards granted from the 2015 financial year 
onwards, the vesting of these shares is dependent on return on capital employed (ROCE) targets and total shareholder return (TSR) 
targets compared to FTSE ranked companies at the start of the performance period. All awards have a three-year vesting period; 
2017 awards are assessed on performance conditions measured over the three financial years ended 30 September 2019. 
Restricted Share Plan 
Granted for the first time in December 2016, the plan is open by invitation to certain senior managers, and provides for an annual 
award of Performance Shares. The vesting of these shares is dependent on remaining in employment for a period of two years. 
Save As You Earn scheme 
The scheme is open to all employees on the UK payroll. Participants may elect to save up to £500 per month under a three-year 
savings contract. An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a discount of 20% from market price at the time of the 
grant. At the end of the savings period, the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months. Employees who are not paid 
through the UK payroll may participate in the scheme under similar terms and conditions, albeit without the same tax benefits. 
  
116 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017  
 
www.easyJet.com 117 
Share Incentive Plan 
The plan is open to all employees on the UK payroll. Participants may invest up to £1,800 of their pre-tax salary each year to 
purchase partnership shares in easyJet. For each partnership share acquired, easyJet purchases a matching share up to a maximum 
value of £1,500 per annum. Employees must remain with easyJet for three years from the date of purchase of each partnership 
share in order to qualify for the matching share, and for five years for the shares to be transferred to them tax free. The employee is 
entitled to dividends on shares purchased, and to vote at shareholder meetings.  
Subject to Company performance, easyJet also issues free shares to UK employees under an approved share incentive plan of up to 
£3,000 per annum in value. There is a similar unapproved free shares scheme for international employees. 
The fair value of grants under the Save As You Earn scheme are calculated by applying the Binomial Lattice option pricing model. 
The fair value of grants under the TSR based Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated under the Stochastic model (also known as the 
Monte Carlo model). The fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant. The following 
assumptions are used:

Share price for LTIPs is the closing share price from the last working day prior to the date of grant.  
Exercise price for the Save As You Earn scheme is set at a 20% discount from the share price at grant date.  
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option. 
Levels of early exercises and forfeitures are estimated using historical averages.  
The weighted average fair value of matching shares granted under the Share Incentive Plan during the year was £11.23  
(2016: £15.04).  
For grants under the Save As You Earn scheme, the dividend yield assumption is calculated based on the actual yield at the date of 
grant. For the options granted in 2012 to 2014, the dividend yield assumption was 2% and this increased to 2.75% in 2015, to 3.5% in 
2016 and to 4.2% in 2017.

(1) In February 2016, easyJet plc issued a €500 million bond under the €3,000 million Euro Medium Term Note Programme guaranteed by easyJet Airline 
Company Limited. The Eurobond pays an annual fixed coupon of 1.750%. At the same time the Group entered into three cross-currency interest rate swaps 
to convert the entire €500 million fixed rate Eurobond to a Sterling floating rate exposure. All three swaps pay floating interest (3 month LIBOR plus a 
margin) quarterly, receive fixed interest annually, and have maturities matching the Eurobond. The Group designated all three cross-currency interest rate 
swaps as a fair value hedge of the interest rate and currency risks on the €500 million Eurobond. The swaps are measured at fair value through profit or loss 
with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the income statement. The carrying value of the Eurobond is adjusted for changes in fair value 
attributable to the risks being hedged. This net carrying value differs to the swaps’ fair value depending on movements in the Group’s credit risk and cross-
currency basis. The fair value of the Eurobond represents the quoted market price of the Eurobond as at 30 September 2017. The carrying value of the fixed 
rate Eurobond net of the cross-currency interest rate swap at 30 September 2017 was £377 million. 
(2) In October 2016 easyJet plc issued a €500 million bond under the €3,000 million Euro Medium Term Note Programme guaranteed by easyJet Airline 
Company Limited. The Eurobond pays an annual fixed coupon of 1.125%. Shortly after the issuance of the €500 million bond the Group entered into three 
cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the entire €500 million fixed rate Eurobond to a Sterling fixed rate exposure. The cross-currency interest rate 
swaps were executed on 8 November 2016 with settlement and notional exchange occurring on 14 November 2016. All three swaps pay fixed interest semi-
annually, receive fixed interest annually, and have maturities matching the Eurobond. The Group designated all three cross-currency interest rate swaps as a 
cash flow hedge of the currency risk on the €500 million Eurobond. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with the effective 
portion taken through the statement of comprehensive income. The element of the fair value generated by the change in the spot rate is recycled to the 
income statement from the statement of comprehensive income to offset the revaluation of the Eurobond. The carrying value of the fixed rate Eurobond 
net of the cross-currency interest rate swap at 30 September 2017 was £448 million. 
(3) On 21 and 22 September 2017 foreign exchange forward contracts were de-designated from cash flow hedge relationships when the fair value of these 
trades was a liability of £4.6 million. This amount is held in other comprehensive income to be recycled to the income statement once the hedged item 
impacts the profit and loss. Foreign exchange forward contracts designated at fair value through profit or loss offsetting these derivatives were entered into 
at the point of de-designation and as such derivatives held at fair value through profit and loss on the balance sheet total a net liability of £4.6 million as at  
30 September 2017, 
The fair value of the Eurobonds are classified as level 1 of the IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ fair value hierarchy. The remaining 
financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed in the table above, and derivative financial instruments, are classified as level 2. 
The fair value measurement hierarchy levels have been defined as follows: 
• Level 1, fair value of financial instruments based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
• Level 2, fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over the counter derivatives), 
which are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible 
on entity-specific estimates. 
• Level 3, fair value of financial instruments that are not based on observable market data. 
Amounts disclosed in the ‘Other’ column are items that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument. They are disclosed to 
facilitate reconciliation of the carrying values of financial instruments to line items presented in the statement of financial position. 
Fair value calculation methodology 
The fair values of derivatives and financial instruments have been determined by reference to observable market prices where the 
instruments are traded, where available. Where market prices are not available, the fair value has been estimated by discounting 
expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.

For foreign currency forward exchange contracts, quantity represents the nominal value of currency contracts held, disclosed in the 
contract currency. The cross-currency interest rate swap contracts are represented at the Sterling notional value. For jet fuel forward 
contracts, quantity represents contracted metric tonnes.  
The majority of hedged foreign exchange and jet fuel transactions are expected to occur on various dates within the next 24 
months. The foreign exchange and jet fuel contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and the accumulated gains or losses 
deferred in the hedging reserve will be recognised in the income statement in the periods that the hedged transaction affects the 
income statement. Where the gain or loss is included in the initial amount recognised for the purchase of an aircraft, recognition in 
the income statement will be over a period of up to 23 years in the form of depreciation of the purchased asset.  
The Group maintains cross-currency interest rate swap contracts on fixed rate debt issuance as part of its approach to currency and 
interest rate risk management. The cross-currency interest rate swap contracts are designated and qualify as either fair value or 
cash flow hedges to minimise volatility in the income statement.

23. Financial risk and capital management 
easyJet is exposed to financial risks including fluctuations in exchange rates, jet fuel prices and interest rates. Financial risk 
management aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose. easyJet’s 
policy is not to trade in derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure. As such, easyJet is not exposed to 
market risk by using derivatives as any gains and losses arising are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged. 
In addition to market risks, easyJet is exposed to credit and liquidity risk.  
The Board is responsible for setting financial risk and capital management policies and objectives which are implemented by the 
treasury function on a day-to-day basis. The policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and 
time periods which the treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks. The policy is regularly reviewed to ensure 
best practice, however there have been no significant changes during the current year.  
Capital employed 
Capital employed comprises shareholders’ equity, borrowings, cash and money market deposits (excluding restricted cash) and an 
adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements. The adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual 
charge for aircraft dry leasing by a factor of seven, in line with accepted practice for the airline industry.  
Normalised operating profit is adjusted for the implied interest incorporated in the charge for aircraft dry leasing. 
Consequently, the capital employed at the end of the current and prior year and the return earned during those years were 
as follows: 
 
2017
£ million 
2016
(restated)
£ million
Shareholders’ equity 2,802 2,694
Borrowings 971 756
Cash and money market deposits (excluding restricted cash) (1,328) (969)
Reported capital employed 2,445 2,481
Operating lease adjustment 770 637
Capital employed including operating lease adjustment 3,215 3,118
  
Headline operating profit – reported 428 504
Implied interest in operating lease costs 37 30
Headline operating profit – adjusted 465 534
Headline operating profit after tax – adjusted 376 427
Headline return on capital employed 11.9% 15.0%
Total return on capital employed 11.3% 15.2%
Return on capital employed is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit after tax by the average of the opening and 
closing capital employed, including the operating lease adjustment.  
The percentage of operating leased aircraft at 30 September 2017 was 26% (2016: 25%). 
Capital management 
The objective of capital management is to ensure that easyJet is able to continue as a going concern whilst delivering shareholder 
expectations of a strong capital base as well as returning benefits for other stakeholders. 
easyJet manages its capital structure in response to changes in both economic conditions and strategic objectives. The cash and 
net debt position, together with the maturity profile of existing debt, is monitored to ensure the continuity of funding.  
On 30 September 2017, easyJet held long-term corporate credit ratings from both Standard & Poor’s (BBB+) and Moody’s (Baa1). 
In February 2016, easyJet plc issued notes under the £3,000 million Euro Medium Term Programme guaranteed by easyJet Airline 
Company Limited, amounting to €500 million for a seven-year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.750%. At the same time 
easyJet Airline Company Limited entered into three cross-currency interest rate swaps converting the €500 million notes issued at a 
fixed rate of 1.750% to £379 million at a floating rate of three month LIBOR plus a margin, with principal exchanges of €500 million 
and £379 million at inception and maturity of the bond. In October 2016, easyJet plc issued notes under the £3,000 million Euro 
Medium Term Programme guaranteed by easyJet Airline Company Limited, amounting to €500 million for a seven-year term with a 
fixed annual coupon rate of 1.125%. Subsequent to the issuance of the €500 million fixed rate notes, easyJet Airline Company 
Limited entered into three cross-currency interest rate swaps converting the €500 million notes issued at a fixed rate of 1.125% to 
£455 million at a fixed rate paid semi-annually, with principal exchanges of €500 million and £445 million on 14 November 2016 and 
maturity of the bond.

Liquidity risk management 
The objective of easyJet’s liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet future liabilities as they fall due.  
easyJet continues to hold significant cash and liquid funds to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events. easyJet 
also has a $500 million revolving credit facility supported by a group of 12 banks. The revolving credit facility was agreed on 10 
February 2015 and was undrawn at 30 September 2017. easyJet has a target minimum liquidity requirement of a minimum of £2.6 
million per 100 seats in the fleet and the revolving credit facility is taken into account when managing this metric. Total cash 
(excluding restricted cash) and money market deposits at 30 September 2017 was £1,328 million (2016: £969 million). Surplus funds 
are invested in high quality short-term liquid instruments, mainly money market funds, bank deposits and tri-party repos. 
The maturity profile of financial liabilities based on undiscounted cash flows and contractual maturities is as follows:

The maturity profile has been calculated based on spot rates for the US dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, South African rand and jet fuel at 
close of business on 30 September each year. 
Credit risk management 
easyJet is exposed to credit risk arising from cash and money market deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other 
receivables. Credit risk management aims to reduce the risk of default by setting limits on credit exposure to counterparties based 
on their respective credit ratings. Credit ratings also determine the maximum period of investment when placing funds on deposit. 
Credit risk is limited to the carrying amount in the statement of financial position at each year end.  
Counterparties for cash investments, currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency swap 
contracts and jet fuel forward contracts are required to have a long-term credit rating of A- or better at contract inception. 
Exposures to these counterparties are regularly reviewed and, if the long-term credit rating falls below A- management will take 
remedial action. 
Disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and other receivables is given in note 12. 
Foreign currency risk management 
The majority of easyJet’s exposure to currency arises from fluctuations in the US dollar, Euro and Swiss franc exchange rates which 
can significantly impact easyJet’s financial results and cash flows. The aim of the foreign currency risk management is to reduce the 
impact of these exchange rate fluctuations. 
Significant currency exposures in the income statement are managed through the use of currency forward contracts, in line with the 
Board approved policy. The policy states that easyJet hedges between 65% and 85% of the next 12 months forecast surplus cash 
flows on a rolling basis, and between 45% and 65% of the following 12 months forecast surplus cash flows on a rolling basis. 
Significant currency exposures relating to the acquisition cost or sale proceeds of aircraft is also managed through the use of 
currency forward contracts where up to 90% of the next 24 months committed forecast requirement is hedged. In addition, easyJet 
has substantial borrowings and other liabilities denominated in US dollars and Euros, which are largely offset by holding US dollar and 
Euro cash and money market deposits. 
Significant currency exposures relating to foreign currency denominated debt issuances are managed through the use of 
cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, where deemed appropriate. These hedges are designated as either fair value hedges or 
cash flow hedges.  
Management may take action to hedge other currency exposures as deemed appropriate. 
Financing and interest rate risk management 
Interest rate cash flow risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash investments. 
122 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017  
 
www.easyJet.com 123 
Interest rate risk management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of financing while retaining the opportunity to benefit 
from interest rate reductions. Borrowings are issued at either fixed or floating interest rates repricing every three to six months. A 
significant proportion of the US dollar debt liabilities are matched with US dollar cash assets by value. Operating leases are a mix of 
fixed and floating rates. Of the 72 operating leases in place at 30 September 2017 (2016: 63), 79% were based on fixed interest rates 
and 21% were based on floating interest rates (2016: 73% fixed, 27% floating).  
On 7 January 2016 easyJet plc published a £3,000 million European Medium Term Note Programme. Under this programme, in 
February 2016 easyJet plc issued notes amounting to €500 million for a seven-year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.750%. 
In October 2016 easyJet plc issued a second Eurobond under this program, amounting to €500 million for a seven-year term with a 
fixed annual coupon of 1.125%. The proceeds from these issuances were used for general corporate purposes. 
Fuel price risk management 
easyJet is exposed to fuel price risk. The objective of the fuel price risk management policy is to provide protection against sudden 
and significant increases in jet fuel prices, thus mitigating volatility in the income statement in the short-term. In order to manage 
the risk exposure, forward contracts are used in line with Board approved policy to hedge between 65% and 85% of estimated 
exposures up to 12 months in advance, which is hedged on a rolling basis, and to hedge between 45% and 65% of estimated 
exposures from 13 up to 24 months in advance, which is hedged on a rolling basis. Specific decisions may require consideration 
of a longer-term approach. Treasury strategies and actions are driven by the need to meet treasury, financial and 
corporate objectives. 
Market risk sensitivity analysis 
Financial assets and liabilities affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other 
payables and derivative financial instruments. The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of changes in relevant foreign exchange 
rates, interest rates and fuel prices. It should be noted that the analysis reflects the impact on profit or loss after tax for the year and 
other comprehensive income on financial instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship held at the reporting date. The sensitivities 
are calculated based on all other variables remaining constant. The analysis is considered representative of easyJet’s exposure over 
the next 12-month period.  
The sensitivity analysis is based on easyJet’s financial assets and liabilities and financial instruments held as at 30 September 2017.  
The currency exchange rate analysis assumes a +/-10% change in both US dollar and Euro exchange rates. 
The interest rate analysis assumes a 1% increase in interest rates over the next 12 months. 
The fuel price analysis assumes a 10% increase in fuel price over the next 12 months.

25. Contingent liabilities 
easyJet is involved in a number of disputes and litigation which arose in the normal course of business. The likely outcome of these 
disputes and litigation cannot be predicted, and in complex cases reliable estimates of any potential obligation may not be possible.  
Having reviewed the information currently available, management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes and 
litigation is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on easyJet’s results, cash flows or financial position.  
As at 30 September 2017 easyJet had agreements with third parties for which fees were contingent upon the completion of 
acquisition activities totalling £4 million (2016: £nil). 
At 30 September 2017 easyJet had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds totalling £44 million (2016: £49 million), of 
which £21 million (2016: £38 million) expires within one year. The fair value of these instruments at each year end was negligible. 
No amount is recognised on the statement of financial position in respect of any of these financial instruments as it is not probable 
that there will be an outflow of resources.

27. Related party transactions 
easyJet licenses the easyJet brand from easyGroup Limited (‘easyGroup’), a wholly owned subsidiary of easyGroup Holdings Limited, 
an entity in which easyJet’s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, holds a beneficial controlling interest. The Haji-Ioannou family concert 
party shareholding (being easyGroup Holdings Limited and Polys Holding Limited) holds, in total, approximately 33% of the issued 
share capital of easyJet plc as at 30 September 2017. 
Under the Amended Brand Licence signed in October 2010 and approved by the shareholders of easyJet plc in December 2010, an 
annual royalty of 0.25% of total revenue is payable by easyJet to easyGroup for a minimum term of 10 years. The full term of the 
agreement is 50 years. 
easyJet and easyGroup established a fund to meet the annual costs of protecting the ‘easy’ (and related marks) and the ‘easyJet’ 
brands. easyJet contributes up to £1 million per annum to this fund and easyGroup contributes £100,000 per annum. Beyond the 
first £1.1 million of costs, easyJet can commit up to an aggregate £5.5 million annually to meet brand protection costs, with 
easyGroup continuing to meet its share of costs on a 10:1 ratio. easyJet must meet 100% of any brand protection costs it wishes to 
incur above this limit. 
A side letter to the Brand Licence was entered with easyGroup, dated 29 September 2016, under which, in return for easyGroup 
consenting to easyJet acquiring a portion of the equity share capital in Founders Factory Limited, easyJet made a payment of £1.  
The amounts included in the income statement, within other costs, for these items were as follows: 
 
2017
£ million 
2016
£ million 
Annual royalty 13 12
Brand protection (legal fees paid through easyGroup to third parties) 1 1
 14 13
At 30 September 2017, £1 million (2016: £nil million) of the above aggregate amount was included in trade and other payables. 
28. Events after the reporting period 
On 27 October easyJet signed an agreement with Air Berlin’s administrators, as part of which it will enter into leases for up to 25 
A320 aircraft at Berlin Tegel airport, offer employment to former Air Berlin flying crews and take over other assets including slots for 
a purchase consideration of €40 million. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and the transaction is 
expected to close in December 2017.  
easyJet completed the sale and leaseback of 10 A319 aircraft in November 2017. Cash proceeds were $137 million; due to the age of 
the selected aircraft at the time of this transaction and easyJet’s maintenance provision accounting policy, a one-off, non-cash 
charge of approximately £20 million (of which £12 million relates to the loss on disposal and £8 million relates to the maintenance 
provision catch-up) will be recognised in the first half of the 2018 financial year as a non-headline item.

a) Significant accounting policies 
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Company accounts are the same as those set out in note 1 
to the consolidated accounts with the addition of the following:  
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. Where subsidiary undertakings incur charges for 
share-based payments in respect of share options and awards granted by the Company, a capital contribution in the same amount 
is recognised as an investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding credit to shareholders’ equity. 
b) Income statement and statement of total comprehensive income 
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own 
income statement and statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s profit for the year was £218 million (2016: £307 million). 
Included in this amount are dividends received of £226 million (2016: £259 million), which are recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established. The Company recognised no other income or expenses in either the current or prior year, other than the 
profit for each year.

The Company has a 49% interest in easyJet Switzerland S.A. with an option to acquire the remaining 51%. The option is 
automatically extended for a further year on a rolling basis, unless the option is terminated by written agreement prior to the 
automatic renewal date. easyJet Switzerland S.A. is a subsidiary on the basis that the Company exercises a dominant influence 
over the undertaking. A non-controlling interest has not been reflected in the consolidated accounts on the basis that holders of 
the remaining 51% of the shares have no entitlement to any dividends from that holding and the Company has an option to acquire 
those shares for a predetermined minimal consideration. 
d) Financial instruments 
In October 2016 easyJet plc issued notes amounting to €500 million for a seven-year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.125% 
under the £3,000 million Euro Medium Term Note programme. The Group subsequently entered into cross-currency interest rate 
swaps on 8 November 2016 to convert the €500 million fixed rate Eurobond to a £445 million fixed rate Sterling exposure. For

g) Guarantees and contingent liabilities 
The Company has given a formal undertaking to the Civil Aviation Authority to guarantee the payment and discharge of all liabilities 
of easyJet Airline Company Limited, a subsidiary of the Company. The guarantee is required for that company to maintain its 
operating licence under Regulation 3 of the Licensing of Air Carriers Regulations 1992. 
The Company has issued a guarantee in favour of easyJet Airline Company Limited, a subsidiary undertaking, in relation to the 
processing of credit card transactions, and also in respect of hedging transactions carried out according to treasury policy. 
The Company has guaranteed the contractual obligations of easyJet Airline Company Limited and easyJet Leasing Limited, both 
subsidiary undertakings, in respect of its contractual obligations to Airbus SAS in respect of the supply of Airbus A320 family aircraft. 
The Company has guaranteed the repayment of borrowings that financed the acquisition of aircraft by subsidiary undertakings. The 
Company has also guaranteed the payment obligations for the lease of aircraft by subsidiary undertakings. 
The Company has guaranteed certain letters of credit issued on behalf of subsidiary undertakings. 
The Company has guaranteed the contractual obligations of easyJet Airline Company Limited, a subsidiary undertaking, in respect 
of a $500 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility was agreed during the year ended 30 September 2015, for a 
minimum of five years, and was undrawn at 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2016. The facility is currently due to mature 
in February 2022. 
No amount is recognised on the Company statement of financial position in respect to any of these guarantees as it is not probable 
that there will be an outflow of resources.

arm’s length basis. Outstanding balances are placed on intercompany accounts with no specified credit period, are unsecured, and
