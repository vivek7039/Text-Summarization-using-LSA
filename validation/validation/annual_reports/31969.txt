2017 has been a successful year for Hargreaves Lansdown with 
record net new business and profits, alongside maintaining our 
usual high client service levels. The delivery of the new mobile

Our Junior Stocks & Shares ISA is one  
of the most popular on the market.
Junior ISA
We offer an easy-to-manage tax-efficient way to save up 
to £4,128 for a child’s future this tax year.
Junior ISAs are opened by a parent or legal guardian, but then 
any parent, grandparent, friend or relative can make a 
subscription.
This allows wealth to begin to be transferred between 
generations and can be used for a number of different 
purposes, such as saving towards a child’s university fees or 
a deposit on their first home.
Hargreaves Lansdown has over 80,000 Junior ISA clients with 
£567 million of AUA. These assets are invested across the 
wide range of funds and shares we offer on our platform.

Strategic report Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017 04
Empowering our clients to save and invest with confidence is 
why we are in business, and I am pleased to report that we have 
delivered record levels of net new business and profits this year 
alongside maintaining our usual high client service standards. 
The Board recognises the importance of developing a team 
which contains the best talent in the industry. We have overseen 
a transition to new executive leadership this year and I am 
encouraged by the energy and commitment they bring to making 
our business even better in the future. This is my last Annual Report 
as Chairman and I am confident that I am leaving a business that 
is well positioned for our next phase of growth.
Overview of the year
Our year commenced in the shadow of the surprise EU referendum 
result, which led to market volatility, uncertainty, which still 
remains, and consequent weak investor confidence. As a result, 
asset gathering in the first half was adversely impacted. The 
business responded positively to this challenge in the second half, 
bringing innovative fund propositions to our client base, launching 
our new mobile app, running successful digital and transfer mailing 
campaigns and maintaining our client service levels through a busy 
tax year end. This resulted in £6.9 billion of net new business for 
the full year, testament to the strength of our offering, brand and 
market position. 
This flow of new business combined with significant market growth 
to drive AUA to nearly £80 billion as at 30 June 2017 . While we have 
continued to invest part of the resultant revenue increase in our 
business to support growth, client service and broadening our 
offering, we were still able to deliver 21% growth in profit before tax 
to £265.8 million.
Board changes
It has been a busy year for changes to our Board and Executive 
Committee. As announced last year, Ian Gorham decided to step 
down as CEO and this took effect from 9 February 2017 . The Board 
thanks Ian for his outstanding contribution to Hargreaves 
Lansdown. Ian was replaced by Chris Hill who initially joined as CFO 
in February 2016, before becoming deputy CEO in September 2016. 
His appointment followed a full assessment undertaken by the 
Nomination Committee. In turn, this led to the need for a new CFO. 
Following an extensive search and rigorous assessment process, 
we were delighted that Philip Johnson joined in February 2017 and, 
after receiving regulatory approval, was appointed to the Board in 
April 2017 . Philip brings considerable experience as a plc CFO 
and expertise from across the financial services industry. Together 
I believe Chris and Philip are a great combination to lead the 
business into its next phase of growth. 
Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
Hargreaves Lansdown’s 
success is built around 
providing exceptional 
service and great value to 
our clients.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
05 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
I am always impressed by the range of dedicated and talented 
people I find across our business. In February, we promoted Heather 
Cooper, our Chief People Officer, to the Executive Committee, 
recognising how our people are integral to our future success.
In May 2017 , I announced my intention to stand down as Chairman 
once a suitable replacement had been appointed. The search 
process is well underway. We have recommended the appointment 
of two new Non-Executive Directors who will be appointed as soon 
as regulatory approval is received. This will ensure that we have 
an appropriate range of skills and experience on the Board 
going forward. 
Remuneration
At Hargreaves Lansdown, we strive to attract and retain people who 
create value for both our clients and shareholders. Over the past 
year, we have listened to the external debate on the structure of 
executive remuneration, consulted with our shareholders and 
responded thoughtfully to their concerns. We are now proposing 
a revised remuneration policy which we believe strikes an 
appropriate balance between these factors and what is right for our 
organisation. This is explained fully in the Directors’ remuneration 
report and I hope you will be supportive of these changes at our 
upcoming AGM.
Dividend
Hargreaves Lansdown is regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). On 3 August 2017 , the FCA notified the Group that it 
intends to reassess its regulatory capital requirements given the 
Group’s strong recent growth in scale and complexity. The revised 
assessment means we had to retain an additional £50m of capital 
to ensure the Group’s regulatory capital surplus during 2018 is 
sufficient. As a result, on 4 August 2017 , the Group clarified its 
dividend policy and announced it would not pay a special dividend 
for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 . Further details on our 
liquidity and capital management approach are contained in the 
Operating and financial review. 
In line with our policy and the notification from the FCA, the Group 
is today declaring a final dividend of 20.4p per share. Following the 
interim dividend of 8.6p pence per share which was paid in March, 
this takes the total ordinary dividend for the year to 29.0 pence per 
share, an increase of 20% over 2016. This generates a total ordinary 
dividend payout ratio of 65% for the financial year ended 30 June 
2017 . The 2017 total dividend of 29.0p (2016 34.0p) per share is 
down by 15% reflecting our decision not to pay a special dividend 
this year.
I am disappointed with this outcome on your behalf. The Group was 
already well capitalised, and we are now even more so. However, 
the Board retains a commitment to paying special dividends in the 
future and I am confident that Hargreaves Lansdown continues to 
have sufficient liquidity and capital to execute its strategy without 
further constraints.
Conclusion
It has been a real privilege to have served as your Chairman for the 
past eight years. I am incredibly proud of how the Group has 
evolved into a FTSE 100 organisation over this period and firmly 
established itself as the UK’s leading retail savings and investments 
platform. I would like to thank all those I have worked with here, 
both past and present, and wish them and the business well in 
the future.

attractive market 
Market background
Investors in the UK have differing degrees of financial awareness. 
Some are confident but face ever increasing complexities from 
regulation, choice and technology. Others are less financially aware 
and need more help in beginning their journey into savings and 
investment. Whether to navigate the complexities or empower 
them with confidence to begin investing, there is a demand for new 
and improved products and solutions to help them secure their 
future aspirations. 
Investing for the future is clearly not something the UK is engaging 
well with given that the UK savings ratio has plunged to an all-time 
low of 1.7% (as per Office for National Statistics (ONS) 30 June 
2017). The UK savings gap, being the gap between retirement 
expectations and the cost of funding such expectations, is 
estimated at £314
1 
billion. The level of funding necessary to provide 
retirement income is increasing, driven by longer life expectancies, 
less generous company and state pensions and ambitious 
retirement expectations. The burden of responsibility for retirement 
is shifting from government and corporates to the individual. Cost 
effective advice is increasingly difficult to obtain in the post-Retail 
Distribution Review environment. However, with successive UK 
governments tinkering with pension savings, the introduction of 
various ISA products, persistent low interest rates, and a reduction 
in the number of financial advisers, finding the right solution for 
your investment needs is arguably more complex than ever. 
As a nation we need to develop a stronger culture of saving and 
investing. Hargreaves Lansdown is well placed with its expertise 
and expanding capabilities to help existing and new clients 
navigate through the minefield of complexity, providing appropriate 
products and solutions for the young through to those at and in 
retirement. Hargreaves Lansdown firmly believes that government 
has a role to play through improving financial education, 
addressing the savings gap and by empowering companies like 
us through proportionate regulation to help provide the solutions 
and education.
Addressable market
Managing investments in one place with a trusted company that 
makes things easy is an ambition for many investors and this 
consolidation process is a journey that many of them go through 
with us given the range of client offering we have. Such 
consolidation of investments on to platforms has driven the UK D2C 
platform market to £190 billion, of which Hargreaves Lansdown has 
a 37 .8% market share
1
.
The UK private wealth market, however, is estimated as c£1.6 trillion, 
of which we see c£1.1 trillion as addressable, giving an implied 
market share for Hargreaves Lansdown of c7%. Outside the direct 
platform space the bulk of this addressable market is held through 
independent financial advisers, independent wealth managers and 
vertically integrated firms. A significant amount of this investment 
pool will have been initially advised upon, maybe many years ago, 
but now receives no ongoing advice. This provides a rich source 
of potential transfers to Hargreaves Lansdown as clients look to 
consolidate all their investments on to our platform.
This £1.1 trillion is concentrated across c7 million people with 
£100,000 or more of investments (source: ONS). Within this 
population there are key segments for us such as Peak savers, 
Pre-retirement and Retiring which alone hold c£900 billion.

made from Jupiter, JPMorgan, Legg Mason and, more recently, in 
July we announced a deal to acquire up to £90 million and 4,300 
clients from BlackRock. We will continue to pursue similar deals 
as they arise.

The size of the private wealth market provides significant 
opportunity for transfers onto our platform. Transfers come from 
across the market spectrum, showing our appeal to clients who 
currently hold assets elsewhere. Many existing clients look to 
transfer and consolidate their investments in one easy to manage 
place, while for new clients the opening of an account and a 
subsequent transfer may be triggered through a desire to have a 
more modern and superior service. With 44% of UK investors now 
claiming to deal with their investments themselves, up from 29% in 
late 2013
2
, there should be continued impetus in the growth of the 
execution-only market.
Market development
The markets for the Group’s products and services continue to 
evolve as individuals’ savings and investment needs react to the 
changing regulatory and market environment. With continued low 
interest rates, Stocks and Shares ISAs remain attractive. The current 
ISA allowance was raised from £15,240 to £20,000 for the tax year 
commencing 6 April 2017 . For some clients this provides additional 
scope for tax efficient investing, particularly for higher earners who 
stand to lose some of their annual pension allowance and are 
impacted by the lower lifetime allowances. With the threat of further 
tinkering to the pension rules, the ISA increasingly becomes a 
long-term investment plan for many and hence provides a 
significant opportunity for new business flows. According to HMRC, 
the Stocks and Shares ISA market is estimated at £267 billion with 
an additional £251 billion held in Cash ISAs. Based on recent HMRC 
data the average annual amount subscribed into ISAs over the past 
three tax years has been c£73 billion. These statistics clearly 
demonstrate the significant opportunity to gather more assets into 
our core ISA products.

The design of the UK’s retirement savings 
system continues to be a work in progress 
for the government. 
On 6 April 2017 , the new Lifetime ISA (LISA) was launched. This is 
open to UK citizens between the ages of 18 and 40 and any savings 
added to the LISA before their 50th birthday will receive an added 
25% bonus from the government. The savings allowance is capped 
at £4,000 per annum and can be used towards a deposit on a first 
home worth up to £450,000 or towards saving for retirement, 
whereby, after their 60th birthday individuals can withdraw all 
the savings free of tax. Our LISA launched just after midnight on 
6 April 2017 and we opened our first one within two minutes. 
By 30 June 2017 , we had seen 14,550 accounts opened with 
£36 million of invested assets. Half of these clients were new to 
Hargreaves Lansdown. Although it is early days for this new type 
of ISA, it could provide fresh impetus for adults to boost their 
long-term savings and for others to start saving for the first time 
using risk-based investments rather than cash. 
Pension auto-enrolment in the UK has continued with more than 
eight million having now been enrolled into a workplace pension 
with both employee and employer contributions being made. 
Escalating minimum contributions have been set so that by 6 April 
2019 the minimum contribution will be 9% of which the employer 
will have to pay a minimum of 4%. The workplace will continue to 
play a pivotal role in retirement saving. The auto-enrolment 
programme has delivered demonstrable successes and we expect 
future government policy to build on this. Our Corporate Vantage 
service is directed at segments of this market and existing schemes 
we administer will also benefit from auto-enrolment contributions. 
The design of the UK’s retirement savings system continues to 
be a work in progress for the government. Auto-enrolment is 
undoubtedly helping and has brought millions of new savers 
into the pension system. However, many millions are still either 
under-saving for retirement or not saving at all. The growth of 
money purchase pensions is mirrored by a rapid decline in 
traditional defined benefit schemes.
Two years on from the launch of Pension Freedoms, this policy 
initiative to put ownership of pension savings more directly in the 
hands of individual investors is proving popular and has helped to 
reinvigorate interest in retirement savings. The Treasury’s review of 
pension tax relief did not result in wholesale change to pension tax 
breaks, however, future changes cannot be ruled out.
Whatever changes in detail occur, we are confident that government 
support for increased private pension provision is robust and this is 
likely to mean continued tax advantages and policy decisions 
designed to promote increased retirement saving. With individuals 
taking more responsibility for pension saving, we believe pension 
providers such as Hargreaves Lansdown, which help investors to 
self-manage their retirement savings, are likely to continue to prosper. 
Demographics and longevity alone will provide growth drivers in 
the key segments but if the UK savings gap can be better addressed 
then further impetus could be had, particularly in the younger 
segments. Although other segments are not so key in terms of the 
opportunity, they still need engagement and investment solutions 
and Hargreaves Lansdown through its breadth of offering can 
address them too. 
Alongside risk-based investments, investors continue to hold cash 
despite persistent low interest rates on cash savings. Our research 
shows that there is a further £1.3 trillion of cash held in the UK. 
Adding a solution for managing cash savings will therefore greatly 
increase our addressable market and hence why we have been 
developing ‘Active Savings’ our digital deposit service.
Competition 
Much is made of the increasingly competitive landscape and 
indeed, new competitors continue to enter the market with 
innovative technology and new solutions. We are never complacent 
and continue to watch the competitive landscape closely. Where 
competition raises further awareness of saving and improves 
financial awareness we see this as a good thing. Healthy 
competition is also good in delivering better outcomes for investors.
Scale, however, remains key to becoming successful and achieving 
this relies on a deep understanding of investors and their needs, 
which is something we continue to really focus on. Once scale is 
achieved, sustainable profits rely on continued investment in 
technology, people and a focus on clients. Standing still is not an 
option and Hargreaves Lansdown is always looking to improve the 
experience for our clients, ensuring value for money is delivered. 
Regulation
Regulation is an ever present theme in financial services and takes 
up a considerable amount of time and resources. Hargreaves 
Lansdown is well placed to address the challenge this brings and 
believes the increasing regulation effectively forms a barrier to 
entry. Our primary regulator is the FCA and it oversees all aspects 
of our work, from how we manage our platform, give advice and 
run our fund management operations to how we communicate 
to our clients.

I didn’t realise how simple  
a Stocks & Shares ISA was
Mr Andrews from Essex
“I opened my Stocks & Shares ISA around a year ago.  
Previously I’d used Cash ISAs, but my fixed rate deal was coming 
to an end. With interest rates so low I felt that investing in funds 
would be better.
My dad is a Hargreaves Lansdown client and he suggested  
I take a look at your website. I was very impressed with the quality 
of the website and the information available. To be honest I didn’t 
realise how simple a Stocks & Shares ISA was and how easy it is 
to invest through you.
Since opening my ISA my wife and I have both transferred  
Cash ISAs over to Hargreaves Lansdown and invested in stocks 
and shares. Just like opening my ISA, the transfer process was 
really easy and there’s a handy indicator available in your online 
account which keeps you updated with the progress of the 
transfer. I’ve been impressed by the simplicity of it all.” Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017 12

We operate a single platform across our entire client base, allowing 
us to support our growing business while maintaining client service 
levels. We are continually investing in this platform to enhance its 
robustness, security and efficiency. This approach has allowed us to 
generate industry leading operating margins of 68%.
We look to use this scale and market position to benefit our clients. 
It allows us to invest in extending our offering and capabilities while 
ensuring we maintain service levels to our desired standard. It also 
allows us to secure attractive fund discounts, competitive share 
dealing and access to a broad range of fund launches and retail IPOs. 
Use of profits
We generate an attractive stream of profits which convert almost 
entirely into cash. Our use of profits is determined by our dividend 
policy, which takes account of market conditions and the Group’s 
growth, investment and regulatory capital requirements at the time. 
Although the Board retains the flexibility to change how we deploy 
profits, we have consistently returned a high proportion of profits to 
shareholders via dividends.

I am delighted to introduce my first Chief Executive’s review. I am 
proud to be leading a business that has clients at the heart of how it 
operates. We are a market leader, looking after the wealth of nearly 
a million individuals; a huge responsibility at a time when people 
need more help than ever in managing their savings and 
investments. We take this responsibility very seriously. Our 
expertise and client service are well respected and I believe the 
strength and scale of our business means we can continue to 
develop its offering to the benefit of all our stakeholders in 
the future. 
2017 highlights 
It was a busy year at Hargreaves Lansdown, providing us with 
a strong foundation on which to build future growth. We have 
broadened our offering, adding products such as the Lifetime ISA 
and two new HL Select funds, launched our new mobile apps, 
increased our digital marketing presence and continued to grow our 
execution-only stockbroking market share. We added record net 
new business (NNB) of £6.9 billion, introduced 118,000 net new 
active clients to our services and grew our active client base by a 
further 14% to 954,000. All achieved while maintaining our client 
service at the high standards to which we aspire to. 
118,000 net new active clients
The importance of offering a wide range of services to clients was 
made clear during 2017 . Brexit proved a drag on investor confidence 
and NNB in the first part of the year, although we still increased our 
market share and grew assets faster than the UK D2C platform 
market. However, we also saw a significant uplift in client share 
trading and associated revenues which carried on throughout the 
year. This resulted in our execution-only stockbroking market share 
increasing from 26.9% to 30.1%
1
, reflecting our competitive charges 
and user-friendly proposition.
In the second half of the year, improved investor confidence allied 
with bringing selected fund launches such as CF Woodford Income 
Focus, the increased ISA allowance and targeted transfer 
campaigns saw NNB accelerate. Strong flows and supportive 
markets saw Assets Under Administration (AUA) increase 28% to 
£79.2 billion. This drove revenue growth of 18% and, despite 
selective investment to support both higher client activity levels 
and our growth ambitions, we increased profit before tax by 21% to 
£265.8 million. It was disappointing that we had to announce on 
4 August that we could not pay a special dividend for the 2017 
financial year from these profits, but we have had a very strong year 
and are well positioned to deliver future value for our shareholders.

Lifetime ISA
Developing our client offering
We continually look to enhance the offering that we provide to 
clients, and 2017 was no exception. Having identified that clients 
wanted to trade shares more, we also established that, for some 
people, their levels of confidence in doing so were low. 
Consequently we developed two equity funds: the HL Select UK 
Growth Shares fund and HL Select UK Income Shares fund. The 
innovation was to increase the communication and engagement 
with participating clients, allowing them to gain insight into the 
management of a share portfolio. As at the end of the year, 
£525 million was invested in these funds. We were also one of the 
first to launch the Lifetime ISA (LISA). Having been uncertain as to 
demand for this, we surveyed our clients, determined there was real 
interest and went live just after midnight on 6 April 2017 . We now 
have 14,550 LISA clients with £36 million of invested assets, with 
half of these clients being new to the business. I am always 
impressed at how Hargreaves Lansdown listens to its clients and 
pulls together to provide solutions that help.
Our desire to bring market leading propositions to our clients is 
critical to our ongoing success. We remain excited by the potential 
of Active Savings, our upcoming cash management service and we 
are targeting a live proposition which is ready to launch around the 
end of the year. This has taken longer to launch than originally 
anticipated due to the significant technology development required. 
This is essential as we are determined that Active Savings must 
deliver the same levels of client service as our existing offering. 
This year we took the tough decision to drop our plans to set up 
a peer-to-peer lending platform. Peer-to-peer is an interesting area 
and we can see the attraction to selected investors, however, the 
market size remains relatively small compared to the other exciting 
opportunities we have in front of us.
We have seen a significant increase in client activity this year. The 
number of calls, applications, transfers, trades and other client 
instructions have all increased and we have continued to invest in 
the resources to maintain client satisfaction with their experience. 
Our IT is scalable and has coped well with the events of the last 
year, including the general election. Our client and asset retention 
levels remain high at 94.7% and 93.2% respectively and it is 
pleasing that our Net Promoter Score
SM 2
 is at an all-time high. 
We continue to strive to provide an incredible level of client service 
in all that we do.
Net new business 
£6.9 billion
Expanding our digital footprint is a key strategic drive: we received 
138.4 million digital visits for the year to June 2017 (up 31% on last 
year). An important enhancement this year was the launch of our 
new mobile app in February. Mobile functionality is no longer an 
optional extra, it is essential for people who want to manage their 
investments. The app has been well received and we are getting 
great feedback from users. We have now had over 486,000 
downloads, and the additional functionality that enables clients to 
place cash with us has resulted in £72 million being added to the 
Vantage platform. The introduction of Touch ID as a means to login 
has also seen a change in client behaviour with more frequent 
engagement with their investments. As a result, we now see more 
digital contact from mobile devices and app visits than through our 
traditional desktop site.
With all of this in mind, I want to recognise the hard work and 
commitment of my colleagues throughout the business and thank 
them. They have strived this year to deliver incredible service to 
clients in the face of significant increases in activity and have 
also managed to develop the range and extent of the services 
we provide.
Delivering our strategy
As the new Chief Executive, my challenge is to drive the next phase 
of Hargreaves Lansdown’s growth. Our vision is to be a household 
name and the best place for savers and investors in the UK. This 
means investment in our people, marketing and technology as 
Hargreaves Lansdown continues to grow and add clients. During 
the year, we deepened our people focus with work on leadership 
and development, our reward structure, culture and succession 
planning. We have worked hard to build on feedback from our 
colleague survey and improve engagement. We have also 
commenced a broader initiative to bring our values, the enthusiasm 
for client service and pride in working for Hargreaves Lansdown to 
the heart of how people work here.
We have a leading brand and reputation in marketing. In 2017 , we 
have particularly been looking at how we use digital marketing and 
client segmentation to improve the effectiveness of spend across 
our channels. We believe these are sources of competitive 
advantage and will continue to invest in them where we can see the 
benefit come through. We have also reviewed our marketing team 
and restructured it to focus more actively in these areas, concluding 
that we will expand it to embrace the opportunities that new 
technology brings.

Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Effective investment in technology is also key. In February, we took 
the decision to set up HL Tech in Warsaw, Poland to leverage the 
considerable IT development talent located there. Our aim is to have 
50 developers up and running during 2018, enabling us to push 
forward with improvements and developments to our services at 
a faster pace. Equally, businesses must ensure that they have 
resources allocated to, and continually adapting their response to 
cyber attack, and we continue to invest heavily here. Ensuring the 
security of our clients’ assets is the most important thing we do.
Looking forward
I am pleased that we have delivered strong 2017 results in an 
environment where the UK has many challenges. Global politics are 
unsettled, our position with Europe in a state of flux and markets 
continue to be uncertain. Unfortunately, this state of affairs is set to 
continue for a while yet. At the same time, society is going through 
long-term changes in demographics meaning that people are older 
for longer. Pension arrangements are moving from defined benefit 
to defined contributions, where individuals must take responsibility 
for managing their financial future, and over a longer period. People 
are not making sufficient provision for this so the country has a 
long-term savings gap of an estimated £314 billion
3
. 
Offering great value and an incredible service
At a time where people need to be taking greater involvement with 
their finances, pensions and savings are increasingly more 
complicated. The advent of pension freedoms, the challenges of 
drawdown, the complexity of lifetime and annual allowance pension 
caps, new dividend and savings tax structures and six different 
forms of ISA have all made it more difficult. People need help.
Our purpose is to empower people to save and invest with 
confidence. We achieve this by continuing to place our clients at the 
centre of what we do: offering them great value, incredible service, 
making it easy and efficient for them to manage their savings and 
investments in a secure environment, and establishing a lifelong 
relationship with them as a partner. 44% of UK investors now claim 
to deal with their investments themselves, up from 29% in late 
2013
4
. This is a significant opportunity for Hargreaves Lansdown. 
We might have a 38% share of the execution-only D2C platform 
market but in the wider accessible investment market of over 
£1.1 trillion, in which we already operate, we have a much smaller 
share and an even smaller share of the relevant £2.4 trillion savings 
and investment pool. Our scale combined with our expertise and 
capabilities places us in pole position to be able to provide 
this help.

The diversified nature of Hargreaves Lansdown, the breadth of our 
product offering and the provision of high quality services tailored 
to the needs of our clients has allowed us to deliver another strong 
year for NNB and significant growth in AUA. We believe the Group’s 
focus on client service is core to our success as a business and 
positions us well for the structural growth opportunity in the UK 
savings and investments market.
Net new business for the year totalled £6.9 billion. This was a strong 
result given first half NNB was held back during a period of low 
investor confidence after the UK’s vote to leave the European Union 
on 23 June 2016. However, with hindsight, these flows were a good 
outcome against the wider environment as we maintained our 
platform market share and increased our stockbroking market share 
over this period. 
The second half of the year is typically our busiest as the tax 
year end is an important driver of new business. This year was no 
exception, with NNB rebounding to new highs. This was driven by a 
recovery in investor confidence ahead of the tax year end and a 
number of self-help initiatives. These included new products such 
as the latest Woodford fund launch, two new HL Select UK funds, 
and the introduction of the Lifetime ISA and the increased ISA 
allowance from 6 April 2017 . The Group’s flows have also benefited 
from its increased digital marketing presence, including the launch 
of our new mobile app, and ongoing transfer activity as our clients 
continue to consolidate their wealth onto our platform. We 
introduced 118,000 net new clients to our services in the year to 
30 June 2017 and grew our active client base by a further 14% 
to 954,000.

Strategic report
Operating and financial review
Total AUA increased by 28% to £79.2 billion as at 30 June 2017 
(£61.7 billion as at 30 June 2016). This was driven by £6.9 billion of 
NNB and higher market levels which added a further £10.6 billion. 
This result was supported by our continued high retention rates. 
Our focus on service and the value our clients place on our offering 
is evidenced in these, with client and asset retention rates 
remaining strong at 94.7% and 93.2% respectively.
The value of assets managed by Hargreaves Lansdown in our 
range of Multi-Manager Funds and Select Funds increased by 
40% to £8.8 billion as at 30 June 2017 (2016: £6.3 billion). The 
growth in assets consisted of net new business of £1.2 billion 
(2016: £0.8 billion), combined with a stock market increase of 
£1.3 billion (2016: decrease of £0.1 billion). During the year, we 
successfully launched two of our own equity funds, HL Select UK 
Growth Shares and HL Select UK Income Shares, which had 
£525 million of AUM by 30 June 2017 . Performance of our range 
has remained good, with 65% of client assets above median after 
fees over the past three years.

Total net revenue 385.6 326.5
Total net revenue for the year was £385.6 million, up 18% (2016: 
£326.5 million), driven by higher asset levels and increased client 
share dealing activity. Within this, the proportion of recurring 
revenue remained stable at 77% (2016: 78%).
Net recurring revenue is primarily comprised of platform fees, 
Hargreaves Lansdown fund management fees, interest on client 
money, equity holding charges and advisory fees. This grew by 16% 
to £296.9 million (2016: £255.3 million) due to increased average 
AUA from higher market levels and continued NNB, partially offset 
by the impact of falling interest rates and a flatter yield curve. 
Transactional revenue is primarily made up of stockbroking 
commission and advisory event-driven fees. This grew by 25% to 
£81.2 million (2016: £65.0 million) from increased deal volumes 
post the EU referendum, which then remained at similar levels 
throughout the year. Due to the timing of the EU referendum in June 
2016, the Group profited from this effect throughout the whole of 
the financial year, but the annualised benefit is now complete 
following its anniversary in June 2017 . 
Other revenue is derived from the provision of funds data services 
and research to external parties through Funds Library. This was up 
21% from £6.2 million to £7 .5 million driven by new Solvency II 
services and additional contract wins.

The table breaks down net revenue, average AUA and margins 
earned across the main asset classes which our clients hold 
with us. 
Funds remain our largest client asset class at 57% of average AUA 
(2016: 57%), and the net revenue margin earned on these this year 
was 41bps (2016: 44bps). The reduction relates to the previously 
flagged transition phase of the Retail Distribution Review whereby 
from 1 April 2016 no renewal income from funds held by clients can 
be retained by the Group. This effect is now complete. Although 
client fund portfolios benefit from scale discounts, we expect fund 
margins to remain at similar levels over the next 12 months.
The net revenue margin on Shares was 33bps (2016: 30bps). The 
increase in margin has been caused by higher equity dealing 
volumes, up 32% on the prior year. There are caps in place on 
management fees charged in the SIPP and Stocks and Shares ISA 
accounts once holdings are above £44,444 in the SIPP and £10,000 
in the ISA. This causes some dilution to the margin over time as 
clients grow their portfolio of shares. We expect the margin on 
Shares to be centred around 30bps over the next 12 months, with a 
range around this depending on actual dealing volume levels.
Cash balances grew strongly over the year as we saw a significant 
increase in cash transfers into SIPPs and ISAs during the year. The 
new mobile app has also added functionality allowing debit card 
cash contributions which has proved popular with clients. The net 
revenue margin on cash this year was 49bps (2016: 56bps). This is 
in line with our expectations due to the reduction in the Bank of 
England base rate from 0.50% to 0.25% in early August 2016 and 
the consequent flattening of the yield curve during the year. The 
impact of this rate reduction takes time to flow through given that 
the majority of clients’ SIPP money is placed on rolling 13 month 
term deposits. Assuming no further rate changes, we anticipate the 
cash interest margin for the 2018 financial year will be in the range 
of 35bps to 45bps.
HL Funds consist of ten Multi-Manager funds, on which the 
management fee is 75bps per annum, and two Select equity funds, 
on which the management fee is 60bps. Net revenue from these 
funds has grown strongly this year due to investment 
outperformance, rising markets and the successful launch of the 
HL Select funds. Due to the new HL Select funds, the blended net 
revenue margin has reduced slightly to 73bps (2016: 75 bps). 
Please note that the platform fees on these assets are included in 
the Funds line and hence total average AUA of £71.7 billion (2016: 
£58.1 billion) excludes HL Funds AUM to avoid double-counting.

Total operating costs 126.7 108.2
Operating costs increased by 17% to £126.7 million (2016: 
£108.2 million) to support higher client activity levels, maintain 
client service and invest in growth. 
Staff costs remain our largest expense and rose by 14% to 
£68.6 million (2016: £60.2 million) due to an 8% increase in average 
staff numbers and higher variable compensation costs, reflecting 
strong performance in the financial year. The changes in staff 
numbers are in line with our commitment to delivering a high level 
of service to our growing client base, which increased in size by 14% 
this year, and capturing the significant growth opportunities we see 
ahead for Hargreaves Lansdown. 
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 28% to £14.3 million 
(2016: £11.2 million) as we drove NNB in the second half of the year 
via conscious investment in our digital marketing presence and 
various marketing opportunities. These primarily related to the tax 
year end, our new mobile app, the Lifetime ISA, the HL Select UK 
Income Shares fund and the CF Woodford Income Focus fund 
launches, all of which boosted flows and new client acquisition. Use 
of mobile and digital media is a key strategic focus for Hargreaves 
Lansdown and we expect to continue increasing our investment in 
marketing and digital opportunities during 2018.  
Depreciation, amortisation and financial costs increased by 
£2.9 million as a result of higher capital spend in recent years, 
primarily on our core in-house IT systems. In addition, £0.8 million 
was written off fixtures and fittings following a refurbishment of the 
head office. Following our decision in June 2017 not to proceed with 
launching a P2P lending platform, we also wrote off £1.2 million of 
previously capitalised costs. 
Total capitalised expenditure was £13.1 million this year (2016: 
£6.6 million). This expenditure was from cyclical replacement of IT 
hardware, the continued project to enhance the capacity and 
capability of our key administration systems, the ongoing 
development of Active Savings and a refurbishment of our head 
office environment.  22 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic report
Operating and financial review
Other costs rose by £5.4 million to £30.8 million (2016: 
£25.2 million). The key drivers of this were additional dealing costs 
resulting from higher share dealing transaction volumes, increased 
professional fees and irrecoverable VAT on non-staff expenses. 
Office running costs are included within this line and decreased 
from £4.8 million to £4.2 million due to rebates received on previous 
years’ business rates. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) levy 
decreased by 24% to £4.2 million. This amount benefited from 
£1.3 million of rebate received this year relating to the previous 
year’s charge. The FSCS is the compensation fund of last resort for 
customers of authorised financial services firms. All authorised 
firms are required to contribute to the running of the scheme and 
the levy reflects the cost of compensation payments paid by the 
industry in proportion to the amount of each participant’s relevant 
eligible income.  
Profit before tax
Hargreaves Lansdown’s success is built around the service we 
provide to our clients. We look to balance the challenge of delivering 
our service standards in a fast growing business with our desire to 
both maintain our scalable operating platform and invest in further 
growth opportunities. 2017 was a good year for operating leverage 
as revenue growth more than covered the additional servicing and 
activity-related costs we needed to put into the business. As a 
result, we were able to maintain our operating margin at an industry 
leading 68% (2016: 67%). We believe this attractive operating 
margin allows us considerable flexibility to balance our client 
service and shareholder obligations across the market cycle.
Profit before tax grew 21% to £265.8 million (2016: £218.9 million) 
on the back of this strong operating performance and the 
£3.7 million realised gain on our legacy investment in Euroclear plc. 
Tax
The effective tax rate for the year was 20.2% (2016: 19.0%), slightly 
above the standard rate of UK corporation tax due to prior year 
adjustments. The Group’s tax strategy is published on our website

Euroclear plc. The Group’s basic EPS was 44.7 pence compared with 
37 .4 pence in 2016. 
Liquidity and capital management
Hargreaves Lansdown is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA). On 3 August 2017 , the FCA notified the Group that it intends to 
reassess its regulatory capital requirements given the Group’s strong 
recent growth in scale and complexity. In response, the Board 
decided it must clarify its dividend policy and how it would be applied 
in the 2017 results. This was announced to the market on 4 August. 
As the Group had not received the formal written assessment from 
the FCA as at 14 August, the date of this report, the impact below is 
based on estimates calculated using the methodology verbally 
communicated on 3 August.
Liquidity
The Group has a high conversion rate of operating profits to cash, 
which is primarily used to fund our growth requirements and 
dividends to shareholders. The Group’s net cash position at 30 June 
2017 was £255.8 million (2016: £208.2 million) as cash generated 
through trading offset the payments of the 2016 second interim and 
special dividends and the 2017 interim dividend. This includes cash 
on longer-term deposit and is before funding the 2017 final dividend 
of £96.6 million. The Group also funds a share purchase programme 
to ensure we avoid any dilution from operating our share-based 
compensation schemes.
Our healthy net cash position has been made even healthier after the 
FCA’s recent intervention and the Board believes this provides both 
a source of competitive advantage and support to our client offering. 
It provides security to our clients, giving them confidence to manage 
their money through us over many years, and allows us to provide 
them with an incredible service, for example through using surplus 
liquidity to allow same day switching between products that have 
mismatched settlement dates.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
23 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Capital
Hargreaves Lansdown looks to create long-term value for 
shareholders by balancing our desire to deliver profit growth, 
capital appreciation and an attractive dividend stream to 
shareholders with the need to maintain a market-leading offering 
and high service standards for our clients. 
The Group seeks to maintain a strong net cash position and a 
robust balance sheet with sufficient capital to fund ongoing trading 
and future growth, in line with our strategy of offering a lifelong, 
secure home for people’s savings and investments. Following the 
FCA’s notification, the Board concluded it needed to retain an 
additional £50 million of capital and hence, as previously 
announced, the Group has not paid a special dividend for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2017 . 
Capital £m
Shareholder funds 307
Less: goodwill, intangibles and other deductions (19)
Tangible capital 288
Less: provision for dividend (97)
Qualifying regulatory capital 191
Less: estimated capital requirement (133)
Estimated surplus 58
Total attributable shareholders’ equity at 30 June 2017 was 
£306.0 million (2016: £253.7 million), as the Group’s continued 
profit growth was partially offset by dividend payments of 
£164.5 million during the year. The Board considers the impact of 
prospective dividends when managing capital against its regulatory 
risk appetite levels and the decision not to pay a special dividend 
for the 2017 financial year maintains this at a healthy surplus over 
our estimated requirements. Further disclosures are published in 
the Pillar 3 document on the Group’s website at www.hl.co.uk
Clarification of dividend policy and 2017 declarations
Hargreaves Lansdown has a progressive ordinary dividend policy. 
The Board considers the dividend on a total basis, with the intention 
of maintaining the ordinary dividend payout ratio at around 65% 
across the market cycle and looking to return excess cash to 
shareholders in the form of a special dividend. Any such return will 
be determined according to market conditions and after taking 
account of the Group’s growth, investment and regulatory capital 
requirements at the time.
Dividend (pence per share) 2017 2016
First interim dividend paid 8.6p 7.8p
Final/second interim dividend declared 20.4p 16.3p
Total ordinary dividend 29.0p 24.1p
Special dividend – 9.9p
Total dividend 29.0p 34.0p
Reflecting this policy and our communications on 4 August, the 
Board has declared a 2017 total ordinary dividend of 29.0 pence per 
share (2016: 24.1p), 20% ahead of last year. This is in line with EPS 
growth and maintains the ordinary dividend payout ratio at 65%. 
The 2017 total dividend of 29.0 pence per share (2016 34.0p) is 
down by 15% due to the decision not to pay a special dividend this 
year. Subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM, the final 
dividend will be paid on 20 October 2017 to all shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 29 September 2017 .
The Board is confident that Hargreaves Lansdown has sufficiently 
strong financial, liquidity and capital positions to execute its 
strategy without further constraints and to operate a sustainable 
and progressive ordinary dividend policy going forward. The Board 
remains committed to paying special dividends in future years when 
sufficient excess cash and capital exist after taking account of the 
Group’s growth, investment and prospective regulatory capital 
requirements at the time. 
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over 
the three year period to June 2020 and confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and 
meet its liabilities up to this date. The Directors’ assessment has 
been made with reference to the Group’s current position and 
strategy, the Board’s risk appetite, the Group’s financial forecasts 
and the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, as detailed in the 
Strategic report.
The Board considers that a time horizon of three years is an 
appropriate period over which to assess its viability and prospects, 
and to plan the execution of its strategy. This assessment period is 
consistent with the Group’s current strategic forecast and ICAAP. 
The strategic forecast is approved annually by the Board and 
regularly updated as appropriate. It considers the Group’s 
profitability, cash flows, dividend payments, capital requirements 
and other key variables such as exposure to principal risks. It is also 
subjected to stress tests and scenario analysis, such as fluctuations 
in markets, increased competition and disruption to business, to 
ensure the business has sufficient flexibility to withstand these 
impacts by making adjustments to its plans within the normal 
course of business.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
Managing the risks to Hargreaves Lansdown is fundamental to 
delivering the incredible levels of service our clients expect and 
generating returns for shareholders. The Board has performed a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group through a

business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity. In 
making such an assessment the Board considers the likelihood of 
each risk materialising in the short and longer term. 
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are 
detailed below, along with actions taken to mitigate and manage

Threshold Conditions 
requirements.
• Regulatory censure. • As part of the ICAAP, Hargreaves 
Lansdown undertakes regular 
capital adequacy assessments to 
ensure that it maintains financial 
resources of sufficient scale and 
quality at all times. These 
assessments include risk-based

At Hargreaves Lansdown, we want to 
make sure that our impact on society 
is a positive and sustainable one
Our purpose is to “Empower people to save and invest with 
confidence”. Achieving this will help people to make more of 
their money throughout their lifetime. Our values are rooted 
in placing the client at the heart of what we do. We believe 
that doing the right thing for clients and employees 
makes great business sense. 
For more information visit our website at www.hl.co.uk/investor-relations/
corporate-social-responsibility
We are committed to managing the environmental impact of our 
operations, treating our employees well and maintaining a great 
culture and working environment. Our approach to corporate social 
responsibility includes these key elements:
Quality – We want to offer the best products and offer an excellent 
service, and are always looking for ways to improve.
Sustainability – We work for the long-term, looking beyond 
immediate success.
Our culture
We have worked hard to create what we believe to be a unique 
working culture at Hargreaves Lansdown and our employees play a 
key part in developing and driving this forward. To identify our key 
values as a business we looked to our employees to provide real 
insight, which ensured the values identified were organic and not 
forced or artificially created. A Group-wide survey was undertaken 
in the year and established our values as:
• Care – put the client first;
• Service – go the extra mile;
• Integrity – do the right thing;
• Simplicity – make it easy; and
• Innovative – do it better.
Putting clients first: At Hargreaves Lansdown there is an 
embedded culture whereby the interests of clients are always put 
first and how they must be treated fairly. This is communicated to 
all employees in the business during their induction and 
throughout their careers. In practice, this includes elements such 
as ensuring that:
• all product design and information is clear and understandable; 
• information and client support is available to clients after the 
point of sale;
• appropriate complaints handling procedures are in place; and
• financial promotion and marketing practices are unbiased and 
appropriate for their audience.
To ensure we are getting things right with clients, we listen to them 
about the changes they would like to see to our services and we 
encourage and actively seek feedback. If clients ever feel the need 
to complain, the complaints handling team carefully investigates 
our clients’ complaint and endeavours to provide them with a fair 
resolution. We benchmark our performance in treating clients fairly 
against statistics published annually by the Financial Ombudsman 
Service for the industry. The results for the 2017 financial year 
compared to the last figures published by the Ombudsman show 
that Hargreaves Lansdown is achieving good results in this regard.
Going the extra mile: Ensuring our clients’ needs are met and 
expectations exceeded is very important and our breadth of 
offering means we have the ability to assist clients throughout 
their financial lifetime. Clients have differing financial needs and 
goals, but listening, finding solutions and treating them as 
individuals ensures we provide our clients with an exceptional 
personal experience. 
Integrity: The Group prides itself on its integrity in dealing with 
clients and staff openly and honestly. All employees are trained 
and made fully aware of anti-money laundering procedures which 
must be adhered to at all times. The Group takes the views of its 
employees very seriously and through its Whistleblowing Policy it 
encourages employees to raise any concerns about malpractice or 
wrongdoing within the workplace. All concerns are treated with the 
utmost confidence and in full compliance with the Public Interest 
Disclosure Act.
Simplicity: We believe dealing with us should be easy and 
efficient. As such, we are constantly reviewing our processes and 
services to streamline interactions and allow clients to conduct 
their business with the minimum hassle through whichever channel 
they choose. Information on our website is easy to find, application 
processes only ask for the information we really need, and if you 
contact us by telephone you will be put through directly to a person 
rather than an automated telephone system. 
Innovative: We continue to innovate around our clients’ needs 
through challenging ourselves to always deliver better solutions, 
better services and a better experience. From the new improved 
mobile experience to our new HL Select funds, we are continually 
delivering new ways to help clients invest. 
Campaigning 
The Group actively seeks to lobby via public consultation 
documents where they believe that investors in the UK will benefit. 
Examples during the year include:
• Working with HM Treasury on the development of the new LISA 
and a ban on cold calling to reduce the risk of pension fraud.
• Lobbying the DWP to give employees more control over their 
workplace pensions and improved access to pensions for the 
self-employed.

Employee well-being
Our dedicated people are central to delivering our values and 
ensuring their well-being is therefore a key focus. In addition to 
providing competitive benefits packages and tailored learning and 
development programmes, we have introduced several workshops 
and initiatives over the last 12 months to raise awareness of 
and promote a healthy working environment for employees. 
This has included:
• Healthy Living Week – a wide range of activities were made 
available such as fitness classes, health MOTs, singing classes 
and mindfulness classes; 
• Healthy Minds Week – an awareness week which included 
workshops on mindfulness, personal resilience, mental health 
and nutrition; and
• Personal Development Week – which included motivational 
speakers, workshops on impact and influence and career 
drop-in sessions. 
We also offer an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) which is 
intended to help employees deal with personal problems that might 
adversely impact their work performance, health and well-being. 
Environment
As a service business that is fundamentally based on intellectual 
capital and conducts the majority of client transactions online, we 
do not see ourselves as a significant emitter of environmentally 
harmful substances. However, the Group continues to promote 
energy efficiency and the avoidance of waste throughout 
its operations. 
Running and maintaining our IT infrastructure at our head office and 
data centres comprises the main source of our environmental 
impact. This supports our award winning platform which is 
fundamental to the success of our business.
Each year we compare the tonnes of CO2 emissions per employee 
per year to FTSE 100 companies in the same sector as us. The 
results in the chart below demonstrate the relatively low impact our 
business has on the environment.

Environmental initiatives: Our objective of reducing waste and 
minimising the environmental impact of our business is aligned with 
our objectives of protecting client data, reducing costs and 
improving efficiency. It is our aim to deal with clients and other 
businesses electronically wherever possible, not only to speed 
up information transfer, but also to reduce the amount of paper 
we use. We have invested heavily in providing a user-friendly, 
comprehensive website, a new mobile app and automated links to 
banks and fund providers. The benefits will grow as more people 
and businesses choose to transact business and receive 
information online. We aim to increase the take-up of online and 
paperless services, and have been successful in doing this during 
the year.

Business travel and commuting: We do not provide company 
cars to managers or to our network of advisers. Advisers are spread 
throughout the UK which minimises travel time and carbon 
emissions. We provide a telephone advice service where a 
face-to-face meeting is not required. In January 2017 , we introduced 
a cycle to work scheme which offers our employees an incentive to 
travel to and from work in an environmentally friendly way and we 
also provide a secure bike park at our office enabling up to 150 staff 
to cycle to work. More employees are now able to work from home 
using laptops, which, as well as consuming less power than desktop 
computers, reduces the need for work related travel.
Recycling: We continue to shred and recycle confidential waste 
and have arrangements for the collection of recyclable waste such 
as printer toner cartridges, cardboard, plastics, newspapers and 
out-of-date literature. We also continue to recycle redundant IT 
equipment through specialist third parties. 
Greenhouse gas emissions: Since 1 October 2013, the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 
has required all UK quoted companies to report on their greenhouse 
gas emissions as part of their annual directors’ report. An analysis 
of our output of greenhouse gas emissions compared to other 
FTSE 100 companies in our sector shows that the Group’s activities 
produce a relatively low impact on the environment.
The Group’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the year to 30 June 2017 
are set out in the table below. Scope 1 emissions relate to the 
Group’s fugitive emissions from the combustion of fuel and 
operating activities and Scope 2 emissions relate to the Group’s 
electricity usage.

We have reported on all of the emission sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013 which fall within our consolidated financial 
statements. We do not have responsibility for any emission sources 
that are not included in our consolidated statement. We have used 
the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised) and emission factors from UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2016. 
In order to provide an intensity ratio for our emissions disclosure, 
we have calculated our greenhouse emissions per employee. The 
Directors believe that the number of employees is the best indicator 
for a Group of this size and nature for the purposes of this 
disclosure. The number of employees used is the average number 
of full-time equivalent employees over the measurement period.
For the year ending 30 June 2017 our emissions per employee 
decreased by 21%.

Community
HL Foundation – Investing in a better future
On 1 September 2016, the Group launched the Hargreaves 
Lansdown Charitable Foundation, the charitable arm of Hargreaves 
Lansdown. This moved the Group’s focus away from one nominated 
charity per year, the last of which was St Peter’s Hospice, to 
between four and eight employee nominated charities. 
Our mission is to utilise the skills and time of our workforce and 
partners to make a positive, sustainable difference in the world 
around us. We focus on four pillars: the next generation, health and 
well-being, improving lives and local communities. Every three 
years we will select charities corresponding to these pillars which 
we will support through a range of fundraising events. The charities 
are nominated and selected by employees and the first five are 
as follows:
Next generation 
The Prince’s Trust 
Youth Adventure Trust
Well-being 
Cancer Research UK
Improving lives 
Guide Dogs for the Blind
Communities 
Great Western Air Ambulance
The foundation aims to provide a centralised focus for fundraising 
efforts, improve support and increase the money raised for 
charitable causes and improve links with our local communities and 
national charitable groups. All of the legal and administration costs 
will be met by the Group so 100% of the money raised will go to the 
employee nominated charities. The day-to-day running of the 
foundation will be by Hargreaves Lansdown volunteers. 
More details can be found on the website www.hl.co.uk/about-us/hl-foundation 
Our tax contribution
Integrity and good conduct are central to our culture and this means 
we aim to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law and 
are committed to conducting our tax affairs in an open and 
transparent way. 
We aim to comply with all our tax filing, tax reporting and tax 
payment obligations. We seek to maintain an open, honest and 
positive working relationship with tax authorities and we do not 
undertake aggressive tax planning ideas.
Taxes provide public revenues for government to meet economic 
and social objectives. Paying and collecting taxes is an important 
part of our role as a business, responsibly operating within and 
contributing to society. Our corporation tax and employer’s national 
insurance paid in respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 was 
£51.1 million (2016: £47 .6 million). In addition, we pay other taxes 
such as VAT, stamp duty and business rates. Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017 30

 Our peo pl e
We are committed to attracting, 
developing and retaining talented 
people who put our clients at the  
heart of our business 
Our values
• Put the client first;
• Go the extra mile;
• Do the right thing;
• Make it easy; and
• Do it better.
Our success is founded on delivering incredible client service 
through the skills and passion of our people who bring these values 
to life across our business. We take extremely seriously the 
responsibility of looking after clients’ investments and only from 
trust and true client focus through embedded values can we build 
long-term relationships and deliver on our strategy to the benefit of 
both clients and shareholders. 
Our people strategy 
We recognise that the strength of our people is pivotal to our 
business and we are committed to recruiting the right talent and 
providing the best environment, culture, training and development 
for our people to flourish. We believe that our people should be 
proud of what they achieve together, with a strong sense of 
belonging to Hargreaves Lansdown and know that we recognise the 
crucial role that our people play in our success. 
A premier destination for talented people 
To attract and retain the right people we offer competitive rewards 
which includes independently benchmarked pay and benefits. We 
believe that working together as a team is key to our success and so 
to complement pay we include the majority of our colleagues in a 
Group bonus scheme, linked to the financial success of Hargreaves 
Lansdown and distributed on an individual performance-related 
basis identified via a performance appraisal system. To encourage 
employees to share in the success of our business we offer 
immediate entry into our SAYE scheme and over 32% of eligible 
employees joined the 2017 scheme. 
To complement the direct financial rewards we provide pension 
contributions and from October 2017 this includes a matching 
scheme (to encourage our colleagues to save for their retirement) 
and extended life cover. From January 2017 , we introduced a flexible 
benefits scheme (HL Rewards) which includes health checks, 
extended holiday entitlements, medical health cover, health cash 
plan, a gourmet card and child care vouchers. Colleagues can 
extend their benefit selections in line with personal preferences 
to include such benefits as the government-backed cycle to 
work initiative.
To present ourselves as a premier destination for talented people 
we have launched a new, fully mobilised careers website which 
promotes our business, our values and our opportunities. 
Engaging our people
It is crucial that our people understand our priorities and are 
engaged in the development of our business. Hargreaves Lansdown 
actively encourages colleague involvement. We place emphasis 
on keeping colleagues informed of the Group’s activities, the 
macroeconomic conditions, current regulatory issues and 
financial performance. We do this via a coordinated internal 
communications programme.
We also believe it is important to listen and understand our 
colleagues’ views and motivation and their honest feedback is 
crucial in deciding our colleague engagement programme. This 
year we partnered with Korn Ferry to benchmark our colleague 
engagement against other high performing organisations and those 
in our industry. We were delighted to have a 78% response rate, 
and followed up the survey with focus groups conducted by senior 
managers and directors across the business. 
Over 91% of employees who completed the survey feel proud of the 
quality of our products and services which places us 12% ahead of 
the external benchmarks. We also made progress year-on-year on 
improvements made to our pay and benefits, the development 
opportunities available for colleagues and the way that 
performance is managed. In January we announced that we will be 
opening HL Tech in Warsaw, Poland to increase the talent pool of 
skilled IT colleagues into the business.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Learning, development and communication
To continue to engage and develop our people, we have introduced 
a range of new initiatives. We opened the Hargreaves Lansdown 
Learning Academy where we house a newly extended induction 
programme, a career development programme, a management 
qualification and team building events. Over 30% of colleagues 
have attended team events focusing on building diverse, high 
performing teams. We support our colleagues in their continuing 
personal and professional learning and development and 
encourage attendance at external and internal programmes. This 
year we introduced a career plan for all colleagues, and an internal 
careers fair to promote the wide-ranging opportunities for personal 
growth and career development in our business. To enhance our 
internal communications a new team have been tasked with 
ensuring that key leadership messages are communicated and 
cascaded across the business.
Programmes for young people 
We are committed to providing training programmes for young 
people and now offer a suite of programmes. This includes an 
Apprenticeship Scheme for 16–18 year olds, where young people 
can train with us in our IT, digital or operational teams, an industrial 
placement scheme for undergraduates, a graduate training 
programme, internships and summer work experience programme 
for school children. We were delighted to receive external 
recognition for our graduate programme by being ranked in the 
Top 100 companies for graduates.
Diversity and equality
We are committed to maintaining a diverse workforce at all levels 
and believe that diversity is a broad issue encompassing variations 
in experience, skills, age and background, as well as more 
traditional diversity factors such as ethnic origin and gender. 
Commercially, and for best practice reasons, we are an equal 
opportunities employer and believe that to succeed as a business 
we need to make the most of the potential of our people whoever 
they are. We have human resource policies in place to attract a 
diverse workforce and once working with us our people can expect 
to develop in an environment that is free from discrimination or 
harassment. We have an Executive Committee member responsible 
for our diversity and inclusion programme, which ensures we have 
the appropriate level of focus in this area to back up our 
commitment with meaningful action and positive change.

Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Group’s 
Governance report for the year. Sound and effective governance is 
at the heart of the Board and the report which follows details how 
we and our Committees have discharged these responsibilities 
during the year.
Role of the Board
The Board’s role is to set the Group’s strategy, ensure it has the right 
leadership, oversee its risk management structure and monitor the 
performance of the business. We are focused on ensuring good 
outcomes for our clients and looking after the interests of our 
shareholders and other stakeholders. The Board considers that the 
Group’s long-term success is best supported by having members 
with a wide range of skills and experience and it is vital that the 
Board has sufficient diversity and independence of both thought 
and action. All Board appointments are made on merit, while at the 
same time considering the diversity required for an effective Board, 
including diversity of skills, experience, background and gender. 
Details of our diversity policy are contained later in this section, and 
a copy of our full statement on Board diversity can be found at 
www.hl.co.uk
The Board
There have been a number of changes to the composition of the 
Board during the year on both Executive and Non-Executive sides. 
As previously announced, Ian Gorham stood down from the Board 
in February 2017 after six and a half years as CEO. Chris Hill was 
appointed as CEO in his place, having previously held the position 
of CFO and Deputy Chief Executive from September 2016. Philip 
Johnson joined as CFO in February 2017 and was appointed to the 
Board in April 2017 after receiving regulatory approval. Philip brings 
considerable experience as a plc CFO and expertise from across the 
financial services industry.
Governance
Chairman’s introduction 
Sound and effective 
governance is integral to 
the Group’s success.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
35 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
In May 2017 , I advised the Board of my intent to stand down from 
the position as Chairman once a suitable replacement has been 
identified. Chairing Hargreaves Lansdown over the past eight years 
has been a real privilege as I have seen the Group grow significantly 
and establish itself as the UK’s leading retail savings and 
investments platform over this period. The search process for a new 
Chairman is making good progress and we expect to be able to 
make an announcement after regulatory clearance in the final 
quarter of 2017 . We have also recommended the appointment of 
two new independent Non-Executive Directors who will be 
appointed as soon as regulatory approval is received. This will 
ensure that we have the appropriate range of skills and experience 
going forward. 
Our committees
Our Board Committees play an integral role in supporting the Board 
and their roles, composition and work performed are outlined later 
in this section. It has been a busy year in particular for the 
Nomination Committee, as discussed above, and also for our newly 
formed Investment Committee, which has implemented and 
overseen its first annual schedule of work. 
Attracting and retaining talented employees is essential to the 
sustainable delivery of our strategy. The Remuneration Committee 
has reviewed our arrangements this year to ensure that employee 
reward is aligned with the experience of our clients and 
shareholders while maintaining our performance related culture. 
As a result, it has recommended that we seek approval of a new 
Remuneration Policy this year, which is intended to deliver these 
features within a simplified remuneration structure. Changes 
include an increased minimum shareholding requirement, a lower 
overall bonus cap and a restricted stock option incentive 
arrangement. Good governance requires open engagement with 
stakeholders and we have sought and responded to feedback in 
relation to these proposed changes, and we hope to receive your 
continued support of our Remuneration Policy going forward. 
The Executive Committee, which is now led by Chris Hill, is the key 
operational committee tasked with strategic delivery. It was 
strengthened in February by our Chief People Officer, Heather 
Cooper, joining the Committee and by the appointment of Philip 
Johnson. The Board is keen to ensure that the strategic aims of the 
Group are known to all colleagues and work is being done to ensure 
that these are fully embedded in the business. The Executive 
Committee has been reviewing its effectiveness against this 
objective, and has recently increased its meeting frequency. It is 
also looking at further ways of improving the Group’s execution 
capabilities throughout the upcoming year.
Working effectively
As Chairman, my primary responsibility is to ensure that the Board 
is operating effectively and focusing its time, attention and efforts 
on the right matters. The 2017 Board Effectiveness Review was 
facilitated by me, with one-to-one discussions with each of the 
Directors undertaken towards the end of the year. This identified a 
number of modest changes to the way we work together, which I am 
confident will enhance the quality of strategic debate around the 
table. 
General meeting
During the year, the Group received correspondence from the FRC 
regarding a technical issue concerning historic dividend payments. 
This centred on the timing of dividend payments in relation to the 
filing of interim accounts and, at the year end, the circulation of the 
audited financial statements. Upon investigation it became clear 
that this was a long-standing issue and in order to rectify, the 
Company was required to take action to release both shareholders 
and Directors from the potential liability to repay the technically 
unlawful distributions. This took the form of a special resolution at 
a general meeting on the 7 March 2017 which was passed with 
99.6% approval.
Compliance statement
The Board has continued to apply good governance practices and 
supports the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code). The Code sets out the standards of good practice in relation 
to how a company should be directed and governed. The Code is 
published by the FRC and further information can be found on its 
website at frc.org.uk.
Having reviewed the provisions of the Code, the Board is satisfied 
that the Company has fully complied with them throughout the 
year ended 30 June 2017 and confirms that the Board believes the 
Report and Financial Statements taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced, understandable and provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the position and our performance, 
business model and strategy. More information is contained within 
the Corporate governance and Remuneration Committee reports. 
I look forward to receiving your feedback at and in advance of our 
AGM on 11 October 2017 .

The Board’s role is to set the Group’s 
strategy, ensure it has the right 
leadership, oversee its risk management 
structure and monitor the performance 
of the business. 
The Board has established five standing Board committees to assist 
it with carrying out its functions and to ensure independent 
oversight of internal control and risk management. The five principal 
Board committees (Audit, Remuneration, Risk, Nomination and 
Investment) all have formal terms of reference that have been 
approved by the Board, and performance of the committees is 
assessed annually. Each committee’s terms of reference sets out 
the specific matters for which delegated authority has been given 
by the Board. These terms of reference are reviewed annually and 
are available on the Group’s website www.hl.co.uk/investor-relations
The Board has also established the Executive Committee which is 
responsible to the Chief Executive Officer for developing and 
monitoring every aspect of the Group’s business on a continuing 
basis, for developing and implementing business strategy as 
agreed by the Board and ensuring that day-to-day operations are 
conducted in accordance with the relevant regulatory and statutory 
requirements. The Executive Committee has established three 
reporting committees to assist it with managing the Group’s 
business. The Executive Risk Committee is an executive committee 
seeking to ensure risks are identified, assessed, managed and 
reported on. It is also responsible for overseeing compliance with 
the regulatory capital requirements under the ICAAP regime. The 
CASS Committee is responsible for overseeing our processes and 
controls over segregating client monies and safeguarding custody 
assets. The Treasury Committee’s role is to define and oversee the 
management of client and Hargreaves Lansdown’s own cash 
balances within the regulatory framework and Group’s risk appetite. 
Each of these committees operates under defined terms of 
reference with clear responsibilities. This clear governance 
framework is shown below.

Matters reserved to the Board
There is a documented schedule of matters which are reserved for 
Board decision and approval. These matters are significant to the 
Group as a whole due to their strategic, financial or reputational 
implications, and include, but are not limited to, the agreement of 
strategies, recommendation of dividends, approval of acquisitions 
and major capital expenditure. In addition only the Board can 
appoint and remove Directors and the Company Secretary. The 
Board also has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal controls and risk management.
Except for the schedule of matters reserved for decision by the 
Board, the Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the 
Group to the Chief Executive Officer who is supported by the 
Executive Committee and senior management.
Board structure
The Board is made up of the Chairman, Executive Directors, being 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, and 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The roles of the Chairman 
and Chief Executive are clearly defined, separate and approved by 
the Board.
Chairman
The Chairman is responsible for the operation, leadership and 
governance of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its 
agenda. In conjunction with the Chief Executive Officer and 
Company Secretary, the Chairman plans agenda items and timings 
for Board meetings. The Chairman ensures that the membership of 
the Board is appropriate to the needs of the business and that 
Board committees carry out their duties, including reporting back to 
the Board. The Chairman is also responsible for ensuring there is 
effective communication with shareholders and other stakeholders, 
and that the rest of the Board is aware of and maintains an 
understanding of their views. The Chairman works closely with the 
Chief Executive Officer to ensure that the strategies and actions 
agreed by the Board are effectively implemented.
Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer has executive responsibilities for the 
operations, results and day-to-day management of the Group. He 
also recommends strategic developments to the Board for 
consideration. He is then responsible for the delivery of the strategy 
and leads the executive management team. The Board has 
delegated these responsibilities to him, and he is accountable to 
the Board. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and 
are considered by the Board to be free from any business or other 
relationships which could compromise their independence. Their role 
is to effectively advise and constructively challenge management, 
along with monitoring management’s success in delivering the 
agreed strategy within the risk appetite and control framework set by 
the Board. They are also responsible for determining appropriate 
levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director’s role is to provide a sounding 
board for the Chairman and support him in the delivery of his 
objectives. He serves as a trusted intermediary for the other 
Directors when necessary and is also available to shareholders if 
they have concerns which communication via the normal channels 
of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or other Executive Directors has 
failed to resolve, or when shareholders prefer to speak directly to 
him. He is responsible for evaluating the performance of the 
Chairman on behalf of the other Directors.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary supports and works closely with the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Board committee 
chairmen in setting agenda items for meetings of the Board and its 
committees. The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring Board procedures are followed, applicable rules and 
regulations are complied with and that the Board is advised on 
governance and relevant regulatory matters. In addition, the 
Company Secretary supports the Chairman in the design and 
delivery of Non-Executive Director induction programmes. All 
Directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary.
Operation of the Board 
The Board has a rolling agenda which ensures that the key strategic, 
financial, operational, risk, corporate governance and compliance 
items are appropriately covered at its meetings. It meets at least 
four times each financial year, meeting seven times in the last 
financial year with two additional strategy sessions. One of these 
was held as an off-site strategy day, and the second, six months 
later, as a follow up session. To ensure that Directors are as fully 
informed as possible, minutes are circulated from each committee, 
including the Executive Committee, and each Board meeting 
includes a report from the committee chairmen as appropriate. The 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors meet in the absence of the 
Executive Directors at least once a year. 40 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

Director independence
The Group is fully compliant with the Code, which requires that at 
least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise 
Non-Executive Directors who are determined by the Board to be 
independent. The Code sets out the circumstances that should be 
relevant to the Board in determining whether each Non-Executive 
Director is independent and the Board has given due regard to 
provision B.1.1 of the Code. The Board has considered factors such 
as the length of tenure and relationships or circumstances which 
are likely to affect or appear to affect the Directors’ judgement in 
determining whether they remain independent. This review is 
conducted annually.
The Board has concluded that Stephen Robertson, Christopher 
Barling, Shirley Garrood and Jayne Styles remained independent in 
character and judgement throughout the financial year and, subject 
to any disclosed and approved or authorised potential conflicts of 
interest, are free from any business or other relationships which 
could materially affect the exercise of their judgement. Mike Evans 
was independent on appointment as Chairman. Christopher Barling 
is the Senior Independent Director. 
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
may have interests that conflict with those of the Group, unless that 
conflict is first authorised by the Board. Directors are required to 
disclose both the nature and extent of any potential conflict or 
actual conflicts with the interests of the Group.
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s articles 
of association allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts that 
may arise, and to impose such conditions or limitations as it sees 
fit. During the year, any potential conflicts were considered and 
assessed by the Board and approved where appropriate.
Succession planning 
The Board uses succession planning to ensure that it has the 
necessary skills, knowledge and expertise in place to deliver the 
Group’s strategy, and that it has the right balance of individuals to 
be able to discharge its responsibilities. The Board regularly reviews 
its composition to enable it to maintain its balance of skills and 
experience. Any searches for Board candidates, and appointments 
made, are based upon merit against objective criteria.
The Nomination Committee has specific responsibility for the 
appointment of Non-Executive and Executive Directors and it 
recommends new appointments to the Board. It regularly reviews 
the structure, size and composition required of the Board and 
makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate. More 
information on the work of the Nomination Committee can be found 
in the Nomination Committee report.
Induction
Our Chairman, with support from the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for preparing and implementing a personalised 
induction programme for all new Directors, to include guidance as 
to their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of the 
Company. We believe that the best way to learn about a business is 
to spend time within it, and we encourage new Directors to spend 
time with our senior managers and executives in a number of 
business areas and to receive demonstrations of key operations 
and systems where relevant.
Ongoing professional development
Every Director has access to appropriate training throughout their 
appointment as Director and we regularly assess the requirement 
for Director training as part of each Director’s annual appraisal.
Our overall objective is to maintain and enhance professional 
standards for all our employees. We believe that these standards 
are particularly important for all staff who fall under the scope of the 
FCA Training and Competence rules. All staff under the scope of 
these rules are required to perform certain training annually. 
Given the rapidly changing environment in which the Group 
operates, all Directors are given regular updates on changes and 
developments in the business. The Board is regularly updated on 
relevant legislative, regulatory or governance changes. Training 
opportunities are provided through internal meetings, 
presentations and briefings by external advisers. 42 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Governance
Corporate governance report
Information provided to the Board
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant information to 
enable it to perform its duties effectively. The Company Secretary 
works closely with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Board 
committee chairmen to ensure appropriate and timely information 
flows within and to the Board and its committees, enabling the 
Board to exercise its judgement and make fully informed decisions 
when discharging its duties.
The Company Secretary supports the Chairman in setting the 
Board agenda, and papers are distributed to all Directors in 
advance of Board meetings via a secure electronic system. Directors 
receive financial information on the Group on a monthly basis and 
now receive monthly briefings from the Chief Executive Officer in 
between meetings.
Director election and re-election
All Directors appointed by the Board are required by the Company’s 
Articles of Association and the Code to be elected by shareholders 
at the first AGM following their appointment. Accordingly, Philip 
Johnson is seeking election. 
The Code also requires that all other serving Directors will seek 
re-election at the 2017 AGM. The Board confirms that all individual 
performance reviews demonstrated that the Directors continue to 
perform effectively and are committed to their roles.
Board evaluation 
The Code and the Financial Reporting Council’s guidance on Board 
effectiveness recommend that the annual performance review of 
the Board should be externally facilitated every three years. 
Independent Audit were engaged by the Board to perform an 
externally facilitated review in 2015, and the subsequent reviews in 
2016 and 2017 were led by the Chairman. 
Following the 2016 review the Board has made good progress 
against its agreed actions, and all actions are either achieved in 
full, are ongoing requirements or, for one action, would not be 
proceeded with.
The 2017 review was presented, discussed and approved by the 
Board in June 2017 , following individual one-to-one discussions 
between each Director and the Chairman. The key theme emerging 
from the review was that whilst good progress had continued to be 
made, there is still further work to be done to ensure that 
information received by the Board is of the highest quality and so 
prompts the appropriate levels of discussion and challenge. The 
detailed strategy and implementation plan was approved by the 
Board in August 2017 following a well structured strategy day in 
June. This plan is the backbone around which performance can be 
measured and agendas framed, with a follow up session planned 
for December 2017 .
Each Director is subject to an individual appraisal annually. The 
Chairman reviewed the performance of the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Non-Executive Directors, and the Chief Executive Officer 
reviewed the Chief Financial Officer. The Non-Executive Directors, 
led by the Senior Independent Director, carried out an appraisal of 
the Chairman. All the appraisals concluded that the Board continues 
to perform effectively and individually, with all the Non-Executive 
Directors continuing to have sufficient time availability to meet their 
commitment to their roles.
Engagement with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining good 
communication with the Company’s shareholders and has a 
programme of communication with shareholders based on the 
financial reporting calendar which includes the interim and annual 
reports, trading updates, the AGM and the Investor Relations 
section of the corporate website at www.hl.co.uk. Our Annual 
Report is an important medium for communicating with 
shareholders, setting out detailed reviews of the business and its 
future developments in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief 
Executive Officer’s review and the Strategic report. 
In addition to this, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer meet with institutional investors after results 
announcements, upon request or on an ad hoc basis during the 
year. They, together with the Company Secretary and Head of 
Investor Relations, also provide a point of contact for investors who 
wish to raise questions, queries or concerns. During the year, the 
Chairman and Christopher Barling, our Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, met with a number of our larger 
shareholders and key investors. 
Following dialogue with individual institutional shareholders, the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer all 
ensure that the Board is fully briefed on shareholders’ views such 
that any issues or concerns are fully understood and considered. 
Analyst and broker briefings are regularly provided to the Board. 
In addition, the Group’s brokers sought feedback from investors 
following the 2016 final and 2017 interim results, and this feedback 
was reported to the Board. Shareholders have also been fully 
engaged in the changes to the Remuneration policy, further details 
of which are contained within the Remuneration Committee report, 
and which is being put to the shareholder vote at our AGM on 
11 October 2017 . Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
43 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
AGM
The AGM provides the Board with the opportunity to communicate 
with shareholders and we welcome and encourage their 
participation at the meeting. All Directors make themselves 
available to meet shareholders at our AGM and they value the 
opportunity of welcoming individual shareholders and other 
investors to communicate directly and address their questions. 
The Company sends the Report and Financial Statements and 
notice of the AGM to shareholders, or makes them available on the 
Group’s website, at least 20 days before the date of the meeting. 
The Notice of AGM sets out a clear explanation of each separate 
resolution on each discrete subject. Resolutions are proposed on 
each subject and all resolutions are put to a poll. The number of 
proxy votes for, against and withheld for each resolution are 
displayed at the meeting. Where the resolutions were to appoint or 
re-appoint Directors, the votes were shown with and without the 
votes of the controlling shareholder (Peter Hargreaves). Votes 
received at the AGM are added to the proxy votes and the final 
results are published through the Regulatory Information Service. 
There is a Relationship Agreement in place between Peter 
Hargreaves and the Company to ensure that the independence 
provisions as set out in the Listing Rules are complied with. The 
terms of the agreement have been fully complied with during the 
year. Following the AGM, the results of voting are published through 
a Regulatory Information Service and on our website.
Other information
Certain additional information in relation to the Company’s share 
capital, the powers of Directors and amendments to its Articles of 
Association that is required to be disclosed pursuant to DTR 7 .2.6 
may be found in the Directors’ report. 44 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Hargreaves Lansdown manages 
risk at a consolidated level, ensuring 
all categories of risk are covered. The 
Group’s risk framework and the internal 
controls framework are designed to 
manage risk within agreed appetite 
levels and aligned to delivering both 
the Group strategy and fair outcomes 
for our clients.
Internal controls and risk management 
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The internal control environment 
is designed to mitigate, not eliminate risk and is reviewed during the 
course of the year by Internal Audit. The methods for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the control environment provide the Group with 
assurance against losses and material errors.

The Internal Control Framework is the ‘three lines of defence’ model. 
Risk management is the responsibility of the operational teams 
which constitute the ‘first line’. Oversight and guidance is provided 
by the ‘second line’ through the Risk and Compliance functions as 
well as from HR, Financial Promotions, Compliance Monitoring, 
Client Protection, Financial Crime and Data Protection teams. 
Independent oversight of the internal controls of the business is the 
responsibility of the ‘third’ line, the Internal Audit function.
The Internal Audit function reports to the Audit Committee, to 
ensure its independence from the business and is subject to an 
external effectiveness review on a periodic basis.
Both the Internal Audit function and the Compliance Monitoring 
team perform a number of audits during the year covering the 
adequacy of controls and compliance with regulation. Results from 
these assurance activities are reported to the Executive Committee 
and the Board and are shared for action with the relevant 
operational teams. The progress against these actions is monitored 
and reported on by Compliance Monitoring and Internal Audit 
respectively. 
Governance
Risk governance Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
45 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
The Board considers acceptance of appropriate risks to be an 
integral part of business and unacceptable levels of risk are avoided 
or reduced and, in some cases, transferred to third parties. Internal 
controls are used to identify and manage, rather than eliminate, the 
risk of failure to achieve our business objectives. The Board carries 
out a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control environment and these reviews are supported 
on an ongoing basis by the work of the Audit and Risk Committees. 
The Chief Risk Officer also prepares a report on the design and 
operating effectiveness of the system of risk management and 
internal controls and this is presented to the Risk Committee. 
The Board believes that the ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing principal risks to achieving the Group’s 
strategic objectives works effectively. The process was in place for 
the year ended 30 June 2017 and up to the date of approval of the 
Report and Financial Statements. In this context the review, in the 
opinion of the Board, indicates that the system of internal controls 
did not indicate that the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory 
and the Board is not aware of any change to this status up to the 
date of approval of this Report and Financial Statements.
Governance of the risk and control framework
Risk management is acknowledged to be a core responsibility of all 
colleagues at Hargreaves Lansdown. The oversight of risk and 
controls management is provided by Board Committees and the 
Group Risk and Compliance functions. 
Key governance committees relating specifically to the maintenance 
and oversight of the risk and control environment are the Executive 
Committee, the Executive Risk Committee (ERC), CASS Committee, 
the Risk Committee, the Audit Committee and the Investment 
Committee. It is understood by the Chairs of all committees, both 
Board and Executive, that risk is a core theme which is evident in all 
committee discussions. 
Risk framework
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management, risk strategy and determining an appropriate risk 
appetite, as well as setting the tolerance levels for which the Group 
must operate. To assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities, 
the Group has a comprehensive approach to identifying, mitigating, 
managing and monitoring risk which is described below. 
The Hargreaves Lansdown risk framework comprises a number 
of elements. The Group has an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks that it faces across the 
risk universe based upon risk appetites and monitoring via the risk 
reporting process. 
Risk management process
The departmental risk register process is the foundation of the 
Group’s risk framework. Each functional business area completes 
a risk assessment in the form of a risk register and this is reviewed 
alongside the ongoing control performance assessment to ensure 
the adequate capture of ongoing and emerging risks to the 
business. The departmental risk assessments are facilitated by the 
Group’s risk team and involve all risk materials being reviewed with 
risk owners against key risk indicators (KRIs) and tolerances. The 
risk owners also have to consider any relevant operational losses 
that have occurred, as well as any current system, people or 
process changes within the department. Where controls are seen to 
be insufficient, management is required to define improvements to 
the control environment to ensure they pose an acceptable level of 
risk to the Group. Identified risks that have a sufficiently high 
likelihood of potential impact on the Group are reflected in the Risk 
Dashboard to ensure they receive a suitably high level of Executive 
and Board attention. The Board takes action where the risks are 
outside of tolerance levels or may become so.

Risk universe
Hargreaves Lansdown has a comprehensive risk framework (see 
Figure 3), capturing both forward-looking risks (executive risks) and 
current business as usual risks (departmental risk). The executive 
risks are made up of two risk sets: strategic and emerging. The 
departmental risks are the consolidated view of the risks to which 
the business area is currently exposed (and would impact business 
as usual) and are managed in the course of normal business 
activity. Risk materials are reviewed by the Board and executive 
management teams on a rolling basis with support from the second 
line business functions. 
The Group has an agreed and documented risk universe, which sets 
out the high level risk categories to which the business is exposed 
and to which all risks are linked. Risks are captured both top-down 
and bottom-up with clear ownership. The risk universe ensures that 
there is completeness in the capture of risks and that there is 
consistency of treatment across all risk categories. 
Risk appetite
The Board has agreed risk appetite statements and risk tolerance 
levels. The appetite statements cover all areas of the risk universe 
and KRIs are agreed accordingly. The Board monitors and manages 
the principal risks within the risk and control framework. Through 
the use of the risk framework, the business balances risk and 
reward within the capital adequacy levels agreed within the risk 
and control governance framework by the Board under the 
ICAAP regime. 
For each risk appetite statement, the Board has agreed inner and 
outer limits, which set out the levels for formal escalation. A breach 
of the inner level requires escalation to the ERC (or the Treasury 
Committee if applicable). A breach of the outer level requires 
escalation to the Risk Committee. A further layer of risk appetite 
management is in place through the operational risk limits (and 
KRIs) agreed for the risks captured under the Operational Risk 
category. These limits are managed by the risk team, with oversight 
and approval from the ERC. 
Risk reporting process
Risk universe data is reported on a monthly basis at the ERC and at 
every Risk Committee by the risk team, ensuring that there are 
appropriate levels of transparency, discussion and challenge of 
risks and mitigation. The risk data reported is based on the 
management information provided by departments as well as 
cross department functions such as second line Compliance and 
Risk functions.
The first line of defence owns and is responsible for managing risk. 
There are also teams with areas of specific focus to support the 
maintenance of a strong control framework; CASS Oversight, 
Operational Control and Revenue Recognition and IT Security. In the 
second line, the Compliance and Risk function includes teams 
focussed on anti-money laundering, fraud, compliance advice, data 
protection, compliance monitoring and risk. This means risks can be 
viewed from a departmental view, as well as by themes across the 
functions in the Group.
Risk dashboard
A risk dashboard is produced monthly by the risk team. The 
dashboard is central to the agendas at both the Board Risk 
Committee and the Executive Risk Committee and reports on 
all the core elements of risk management, including; risks, risk 
appetite and risk events. Risk data is also reviewed in local 
management meetings. 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)
The primary purpose of the ICAAP is to ensure that there is a clear, 
accurate and transparent link between the risk profile of the 
business and the capital held by the firm. ICAAP compliance is 
overseen by the Risk Committee, with day-to-day management of 
compliance overseen by the second line risk team.
The key elements of the ICAAP are reviewed on a cyclical basis by 
the ERC prior to discussion, challenge and approval by the Risk 
Committee. The ICAAP activity is integrated into the wider risk 
framework, ensuring consistency in risk reporting, and a clear link 
between the detailed departmental risk registers and the capital 
held by the business.

Audit Committee report
Dear shareholder
It has been a busy year for the Audit Committee during which we 
have worked closely with the Risk Committee to ensure the Group 
maintains a robust control environment. In particular, we have 
focused on preparation for the FRC’s new CASS audit standard, 
overseen the Group’s rationalisation plans, the integrity of the 
financial reporting process and reviewed the work of both external 
and internal audit. The Committee also devoted considerable 
attention to the findings of the FRC’s review of the 2016 
Annual Report. 
The Committee has been actively engaged through the year 
with a number of important personnel changes in the executive 
leadership, Finance and Internal Audit teams. I am encouraged by 
the additional financial services and public company experience 
which we have brought into the business, and the positive tone 
from the top that they are communicating and embedding in 
their teams.
I am also pleased with the progress made in this year’s Report 
and Financial Statements to improve the quality of the document, 
its look and feel, and particularly the evolution of the financial 
statements to align with more modern practice and improve 
their accessibility.
As Chairman of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present this 
report and I will be available at the Annual General Meeting to 
answer any questions about our work through the year. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Audit Committee –  
membership and attendance
The Audit Committee meets at least four times each year, there were 
five scheduled meetings during the financial year and additional ad 
hoc meetings where required. The attendance by each Director is 
set out in the table below. I chair the Committee and its other 
members at 30 June 2017 were Christopher Barling, Stephen 
Robertson and Jayne Styles.
The FRC has recently updated the Corporate Governance Code to 
place a requirement upon audit committees to have relevant 
industry experience and expertise. The Committee has considered 
this point and can confirm that it does meet the requirement 
as both Shirley Garrood and Jayne Styles have significant 
experience of the asset management sector and wider financial 
services industry.
The Corporate Governance Code also requires at least one member 
to have recent and relevant financial experience; this requirement is 
fulfilled by the Committee Chairman. Membership of the Committee 
is regularly reviewed by the Committee Chairman with any 
recommendations for appointment being made to the Nomination 
Committee to present to the Board. Appointments are made for a 
three-year period and can be extended for no more than two 
additional three-year periods. No new appointments were made to 
the Committee during the year.
The Chairman, Head of Internal Audit and Chief Financial Officer are 
routinely invited to, and attend, the majority of meetings. However, 
the Committee reserves the right to ask any of these individuals to 
withdraw. The external auditor also attended all meetings. The 
Committee also meets privately with the Head of Internal Audit and 
the external audit team through the year.
The members of the Audit Committee at 30 June 2017 and attendees 
at the five Committees held during the 12 month period were:

external auditor’s senior engagement partner.
Ongoing training is provided to help committee members perform 
their duties, this may include attendance at formal conferences, 
briefings by specialist Hargreaves Lansdown staff and briefings by 
external accountancy firms.

Financial reporting
On behalf of the Board, the Committee, with support and input from 
the external auditor, has examined the Report and Financial 
Statements, interim financial statements and the trading updates, 
together with the related disclosures, application and consistency 
of accounting policies and the financial reporting process. This 
examination has included the review, consideration and approval of 
the Report and Financial Statements, the viability statement and the 
going concern statement. There has been an emphasis on ensuring 
that these are fair, balanced and understandable.
The integrity of the Report and Financial Statements is underpinned 
by the control environment. The review of risk management systems 
is conducted by the Risk Committee (as outlined in its Terms of 
Reference). However, the Audit Committee continues to review 
those key controls where a failure could impact the integrity of 
financial record-keeping, reporting and disclosure. In this regard, 
the Committee has considered risk and control reports from the 
Head of Internal Audit, the Chief Risk Officer and the Group Director 
of Risk and Compliance and satisfied itself that the integrity of the 
control environment supporting the financial reporting and 
disclosure process is appropriate. 50 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
During the year, the Group received correspondence from the 
FRC’s Corporate Governance & Reporting division in relation to a 
review of the 2016 Annual Report. The FRC made four observations 
as to how the Group could improve future reporting and these 
have been considered in the drafting of the 2017 Report and 
Financial Statements. 
As a result, minor changes to the presentation of earnings per 
share, share-based payments, disclosure of material balances 
separately and interests in unconsolidated structured entities have 
been incorporated. No matters contained within the letter remained 
open at 30 June 2017 . 
Significant financial judgements and financial reporting for 
2017
In reviewing the Report and Financial Statements, the Committee 
has concluded that there are no significant financial judgements. 
As part of its review the Committee has considered the following 
key areas:
Revenue  
Hargreaves Lansdown’s revenue stream continues to be non-
complex, mainly consisting of high-volume, low-value transactions. 
The Committee is provided with a range of management 
information and details regarding reconciliations carried out on 
cash, stock, client money and client assets which provide 
confidence in the revenue calculation. Further confidence is 
provided by the external auditor from their approach of fully 
recalculating the Group’s significant revenue streams. Sample-
based testing is also conducted for those revenue streams not fully 
recalculated. The Committee has also received reports from Internal 
Audit on the client charging process.
Capitalisation of intangible assets
The Group continues to invest in the Active Savings proposition. 
Once developed, the Group expects there to be a long-term benefit 
and, as such, the Committee has reviewed and agreed the 
appropriate accounting treatment for capitalising development 
costs incurred. For the year to 30 June 2017 , £3.7 million has been 
capitalised in respect of the Active Savings platform. The 
Committee also reviewed and agreed the £1.2 million impairment of 
previously capitalised intangible assets relating to the peer-to-peer 
development following the Group’s decision to cease this activity in 
June 2017 . 
Goodwill
The statement of financial position shows £1.3 million of goodwill 
relating to the acquisition of shares in HL Pensions Direct (now 
called HL Advisory Services). In accordance with IAS 36, an annual 
test of impairment of goodwill was undertaken and the Committee 
was presented with the results which demonstrated that no 
impairment was required. 
Share-based payments
The Committee reviewed the key assumptions used for the 
valuation of options relevant to the Company’s share-based 
incentive schemes and the performance period over which fair 
values are amortised. It also ensured these were all appropriately 
accounted for in the 2017 Report and Financial Statements. 
The Committee has also discussed the likely vesting outcomes 
for the 2014 and 2015 Directors’ LTIP based upon the performance 
criteria set. 
Segmental reporting
In the current period, consideration has been given to the nature of 
the operating segments previously disclosed and it is the view of 
the Committee that there is in fact only one segment reported to the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker, being the Group – a direct-to-
investor investment service administering investments in ISA, SIPP 
and Fund & Share accounts, providing services for individuals and 
corporates. It was considered that segmental reporting, as 
previously presented, did not provide a clearer or more accurate 
view of the reporting within the Group and hence the business has 
been reported as one unit in the 2017 Annual Report.
Review of the Report and Financial Statements
The Board has asked the Committee to review the Report and 
Financial Statements prior to publication. This was undertaken prior 
to and at the August 2017 meeting by satisfying ourselves that 
there was a robust process of challenge, examining reports from 
both management and the external auditor relating to the Report 
and Financial Statements, and reviewing consistency with internal 
reports presented to the Board by management, the CFO, Head of 
Internal Audit, Group Director of Risk and Compliance and Chief Risk 
Officer during the year. After challenge, debate and consideration of 
all relevant information, the Committee concluded that it could 
recommend to the Board that the 2017 Report and Financial 
Statements is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
shareholders with the information necessary to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy in an 
understandable manner.
Viability statement
The Committee has assessed the viability of the Group over the 
three year period to June 2020 on behalf of the Board. It has also 
reviewed the statements made in the Report and Financial 
Statements to ensure they comply with disclosure requirements.
External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for the Group’s 
relationship with the external auditor and for monitoring their 
independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical and 
regulatory requirements. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed and approved an updated 
policy regarding the use of the external auditor for non-audit 
services. The policy ensures that external auditor independence is 
maintained when considering whether it is appropriate for the 
Governance

external auditor to be appointed by the Company to undertake work 
outside of the scope of their usual and specific annual audit.
The proportion of non-audit to audit fees during the year was 54% 
(2016: 25%) which remains within the limits set by the EU Audit 
Reform Directive. The Committee also considered performance 
against the 2016 audit plan and approved modest overruns. Both 
the Finance team and the external auditor have taken actions to 
avoid repetition in 2017 . 
There were £241,000 of non-audit fees during 2017 (2016: 
£153,000). £160,000 of this amount related to the FCA-mandated 
assurance reporting of subsidiaries regulated under the CASS rules 
(2016: £100,000), £33,000 related to the profit-verification work 
to enable payment of dividends in line with the established 
timetable (2016: £39,000), £25,000 related to the interim review 
(2016: £14,000) and £23,000 related to additional assurance 
services. Fees for the statutory audit for 2017 were £150,000 
(2016: £212,000). 
PwC is the Group’s auditor having been appointed following a 
formal tender in 2013. Alex Bertolotti was the lead audit partner 
throughout the financial year, having been appointed during the 
prior year. In line with the EU audit regulation requirements, 
Hargreaves Lansdown will be required to undertake a formal tender 
process at least every ten years and hence this will be required by 
2023. In addition, the Senior Engagement Partner is required to be 
replaced every five years in accordance with the regulation. The 
Group has complied with the provisions of the Competition Markets 
Authority Order 2014 throughout the year under review and as at 
the date of this report.
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
auditor by means of a questionnaire and an assessment of 
performance against relevant external guidance. We continue to 
believe PwC conducts its audit work to a high standard, remains 
independent and objective as demonstrated by consideration of 
the quality, experience, continuity and training of the audit team. 
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board that 
a resolution is put to shareholders recommending PwC’s 
reappointment and their terms of engagement and remuneration 
at the AGM of the Company. This will continue to be assessed on 
an annual basis.
The external auditor will be asked to attend the AGM and will be 
available to answer shareholders’ questions about the audit and 
their report.
Internal Audit
The Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities 
through its oversight of the adequacy of resourcing and plans of the 
Internal Audit department. Historically, Internal Audit presented its 
risk-based audit plans to the Audit Committee twice a year for 
prioritisation and approval. Following discussions with the Audit 
Committee, the Internal Audit team now present their plan to the 
Audit Committee for approval on a quarterly basis allowing greater 
flexibility and the ability to respond to perceived risks as they arise. 
Internal Audit are currently implementing a set of standard culture 
tests as part of each audit, that will specifically assess client focus, 
ethics and integrity, risk awareness and employee engagement. The 
assessments will be shown in the executive summary of each audit 
report and on an annual basis each assessment will be pooled and 
used by Internal Audit to provide an independent view on the 
culture of the Group.
The Institute of Internal Auditors recommends that an external 
review of the Internal Audit function is carried out no less than 
every five years. To this end, in September 2016 the Audit 
Committee engaged Protiviti to conduct an assessment of the 
Internal Audit function. The review, confirmed that the Internal Audit 
team are “generally conforming” to the standards laid out by the 
Institute of Internal Auditors. This is the highest rating in the 
standard, but also highlighted areas where minor enhancements 
could be made. The Committee are pleased to report that these 
improvements have been made.
During the year, the Audit Committee has been involved in the 
selection of a new Head of Internal Audit with the appointment 
being made in July 2017 . This was as a result of the former Head of 
Internal Audit moving to a senior, controls-focused role within the 
Group’s operations team. The Committee welcome this additional 
resource being applied to a vital area of the business.
Internal controls
The Committee received a report from the Risk Committee with its 
conclusions on the design and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management systems. The Committee considered this alongside 
a report from the Head of Internal Audit on the effectiveness of 
internal controls and demonstrating management responsiveness 
in addressing issues identified. The Committee has also reviewed 
an assessment of the effectiveness of the Group’s fraud 
risk controls.
The Committee receives reports at each meeting from Finance, the 
CASS Oversight team and Internal Audit. The Committee challenged 
the key executives on the content and veracity of those reports. 
Overall, the Committee is satisfied that there are appropriate 
arrangements, actions or mitigating controls in place. 
The year ended 30 June 2017 is the first year for which the Group 
will need to be audited under the FRC’s new standard regarding 
CASS assurance reports. The FRC has introduced this new standard 
to improve the quality and consistency of reporting and assurance 
around client assets across the financial services industry. The 
Committee has also devoted time to reviewing the Group’s 
rationalisation plans, intended to achieve increased efficiency 
across the Group in relation to shared client money protection 
controls and activities. The Committee has discussed the substance 
and the impact of these changes and approved the way in which 
they have been dealt with.  52 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Audit Committee effectiveness
Following last year’s review the following steps have been taken to 
improve the effectiveness of the Committee further:
• Drafts of the front half of the Report and Financial Statements 
were provided to the Committee in more advanced form, to allow 
review, challenge and input. This was in response to a wider 
move to bring forward the Group’s reporting date; and
• The Committee has continued to oversee and provide challenge 
to the Group’s control framework.
The Committee has chosen to review its effectiveness by means 
of a self assessment questionnaire this year. The results show that 
the Committee believes it is operating effectively and working 
as expected.

Why I chose drawdown  
from Hargreaves Lansdown
Mrs Hines from Gloucestershire 
“I love the freedom I have with my HL drawdown account.  
I can do almost everything online, which is a great convenience. 
Being able to take a flexible income allows me to make the most 
of my tax allowances. I tally up how much I receive from other 
income sources and decide how much to withdraw.
Keeping control of my pension means I can take advantage of 
investment opportunities as they arise. The plentiful research and 
expert comment available through the HL website is a great help 
with this, plus it’s really easy to monitor my investment 
performance online. 
I’m very pleased I chose Hargreaves Lansdown to provide my 
drawdown pension. I would not hesitate to recommend them to 
anyone who wishes to move their investments to a professional, 
innovative and value for money service.” 54 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Role of the Investment Committee
The Committee is tasked with providing challenge and oversight to 
the investment business, including investment research decision 
making, Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive 
(AIFMD) compliance, policies and outcomes relating to Hargreaves 
Lansdown Multi-Manager funds, HL Select funds, Portfolio 
Management Services (PMS), HL Portfolio+, Wealth 150+, Master 
Portfolios and Foundation Portfolios and the marketing of third-
party funds.
In providing independent challenge, the Committee assists the 
Board with its Multi-Manager funds’ AIFMD oversight requirements 
relating to asset allocation, investment strategy and performance, 
together with oversight of the investment risk management process.

Investment Committee report
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the Investment Committee’s report for 2017 . 
As from 1 August 2016 the Committee became a full committee of 
the Board, having previously been a responsibility of the Executive 
Committee. The Committee was established to provide oversight of 
the investment part of the Group, including its governance and 
product offerings. Over the period, the Committee has received 
information from the investment business regarding the Group’s 
investment product range and performance, as well as information 
relating to the controls framework and risks.
The Committee has also overseen the launch of the new HL Select 
funds and continues to provide challenge to the executive team in 
relation to all aspects of the investment business. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
55 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
On an ongoing basis, membership of the Committee is reviewed by 
the Chairman of the Committee and any recommendations for new 
appointments are made to the Nomination Committee for onward 
recommendation to the Board. Following year end, the composition 
of the Committee was changed. Philip Johnson has been appointed 
to the Committee with effect from 10 August 2017 to provide 
additional oversight expertise given his previous experience, and 
the non-plc director members became attendees only.
Main activities during the year 
In discharging its responsibilities the Committee concentrated on 
the following areas:
•  Risk and compliance, including monitoring of conflicts of interest, 
and challenge to the policies, such as personal account dealing, 
as well as review of regular risk updates from the Group’s risk 
function. Liquidity calculations and testing for the HL Multi-
Manager funds have been challenged, and the Committee has 
also provided challenge in respect of the life styling process for 
corporate clients;
• Consideration of investment team updates, which cover 
HL Multi-Manager fund performance information, as well as 
information about the performance of the HL Select funds, PMS, 
HL Portfolio+, Wealth 150, Master Portfolios and Foundation 
Portfolios. The updates also include market information, and 
oversight of the communication process to clients in respect of 
Hargreaves Lansdown’s investment products, particularly in 
respect of the new HL Select fund launches. The Committee also 
reviewed the flows of business into and out of the Group’s 
investment offerings;
• The Committee received and discussed a gap analysis that 
considered whether there are any products being offered which 
do not fully satisfy our clients’ requirements, and whether there 
were any further products which could be offered to further 
enhance our clients’ experience; and
• Challenge and oversight of the HL Select Equity fund launches, 
and for providing a recommendation to the Board regarding the 
launch of the new products.

We have also made important progress on a range of strategic 
initiatives that will drive future growth. 
The Committee considers that these results have been the result of a 
strong performance from our leadership team. Through a consistent 
focus on putting the needs of our clients first, our Directors have 
delivered results to the benefit of the Company and our shareholders 
and this has been reflected in their remuneration for the year.
Review of Remuneration Policy 
Over the last year, we have been examining our approach to 
remuneration. Our purpose has been to simplify our incentives and 
ensure that how we pay is more closely aligned with the 
performance of the Executive Directors and the value we deliver to 
our clients and shareholders.
Relentless focus on our clients and their needs, combined with an 
ability to get things done, are two key elements in our success. The 
challenge for the Executive Directors is to balance the delivery of 
our service standards in a fast growing business with our desire to 
both maintain our scalable operating platform and invest in further 
long-term growth opportunities. This balance of short-term 
performance with longer-term investment and growth has been 
central to the debate within the Remuneration Committee over the 
last year. Our objectives for the new policy have been to incentivise 
in a similarly balanced manner across both the short and long-term, 
enabling us to reward strong stewardship of the business today and 
for the future and to align executives’ interests with those of 
shareholders over the longer term.
The Committee recognised that the previous Long Term Incentive 
Plan was not as effective in achieving this outcome as had been 
intended. The scheme did not result in directors building up a long 
term shareholding and hence long term alignment with 
shareholders. Furthermore, the scheme did not act as an incentive, 
had no retentive draw and did not influence behaviour. The 
Committee concluded that the proposed Sustained Performance 
Plan would enhance the alignment of directors with shareholders.
We have listened to the external debate on the structure of 
executive remuneration, and have noted the conclusions of the 
Investment Association Executive Remuneration Working Group in 
June 2016, as well as the recent BEIS Select Committee Report that 
alternatives to typical LTIPs may be used where more appropriate. 
This, combined with our own consideration of what is most 
appropriate for this organisation, has led to us wanting to simplify 
our approach to long-term incentives.
We have delivered this balance through retaining an annual 
performance bonus with a strong focus on rewarding short-term 
performance and through greater deferral of annual bonuses into 
Hargreaves Lansdown shares, a proposed new approach to 
long-term incentives and by increasing the minimum shareholdings 
which our Executive Directors will need to build.
Directors’ remuneration report
Annual statement by the  
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s report for 2017 .
During this year, the Committee has continued to evolve our 
approach to executive remuneration. In last year’s report we 
described changes in the way we were applying our current 
Remuneration Policy (notably the decision not to make further 
awards under our existing LTIP). We have further developed our 
approach, culminating in the revised Remuneration Policy now 
being presented for approval. 
This year has also seen a number of changes to our executive 
leadership, with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and so the Committee has 
sought to determine appropriate packages for these individuals.
Business context in 2017
As discussed in the Strategic report, this year has seen a strong 
performance across our business. While asset gathering was 
impacted during a period of weak investor confidence during the 
first half of the year, we still increased our market share in both the 
platform and share dealing markets. The breadth of our offering 
then allowed us to deliver significant growth during a period of 
improving confidence in the second half of the year. Our marketing 
efforts on the back of the launches of the CF Woodford Income 
Focus Fund and our HL Select UK Income Shares Fund, the new 
higher ISA allowance from April 2016, the launch of our Lifetime ISA 
and further development of our digital marketing presence, all 
increased flows into the business, meaning that we have increased 
our client base, the value of assets under administration, and our 
market share. Importantly, client service standards were maintained 
throughout the period. This growth has translated into a strong 
financial performance, with net revenues and profit up year-on-year.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
57 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
We propose to:
• Adopt a new five year Sustained Performance Plan to replace our 
three year LTIP. Under this plan, executives will receive a 
conditional award of nil cost options with a face value of up to 
half times base salary each year, subject to underpinning 
performance conditions measured over five years; in comparison, 
the previous LTIP had a maximum grant of two and a half times 
base salary albeit of market priced options;
• Reduce the maximum annual bonus payable under the policy 
from five times base salary to three and a half times base salary 
and increase the level of deferral from 30% to 40% of any bonus 
earned. This deferral will be wholly in nil cost options; and
• Increase the minimum shareholding guideline for our Executive 
Directors from two times base salary to three times base salary, 
to be built up over six years.
The Chairman of the Company and the Chairman of the Committee 
routinely engage with shareholders on matters of remuneration, to 
listen to and take into account their views. This activity was 
increased in the year given our review and, as a result of this 
engagement with shareholders on the proposed changes, the 
maximum annual bonus opportunity for Directors was further 
reduced from an original proposal of four times salary to three and 
a half times salary and the minimum shareholding requirement was 
increased from two times to three times base salary.
Further details of these changes are set out in our revised 
Remuneration policy.
The Committee continues to be satisfied that the structure of the 
remuneration package ensures appropriate consideration is given 
to environmental, social and governance issues, does not 
incentivise inappropriate risk taking and will continue to ensure that 
there is no reward for inappropriate behaviour demonstrated by any 
Executive Director. 
Executive Director changes
As previously announced, Ian Gorham stepped down as CEO in 
February 2017 . He will remain with the Group until 30 September 
2017 to ensure a smooth transition, and his existing conditions of 
employment will continue in accordance with his service contract 
until this date. Mr Gorham’s bonus for this year has been pro-rated 
to reflect the period for which he was in post as CEO. Full details of 
this, and his remuneration for the year are set out in the annual 
report on remuneration. 
Chris Hill was subsequently appointed as CEO and Philip Johnson as 
CFO. Chris Hill’s base salary on appointment was £600,000 per 
annum and Philip Johnson’s was £425,000 per annum. Neither base 
salary will be increased from 1 July 2017 . No awards were granted to 
Philip Johnson on joining.
Remuneration outcomes for 2017
The Committee considered in detail the Group’s performance over 
the year in determining the level of bonuses to be awarded to 
executives. At a Group level, this reflected above-target 
performance for growth measures, on-target performance for client 
measures and below-target delivery of strategic goals. Performance 
against individual objectives has also been considered. In light of 
the strong financial performance for the year and reflecting 
achievements against the targets set, bonuses have been awarded 
at an above-target level.
The bonuses paid to each Executive Director have been pro-rated to 
reflect their time in role. For Ian Gorham, his bonus is based on his 
seven months as CEO. Chris Hill’s bonus has been determined to 
reflect the periods of the year spent as CFO, Deputy CEO and CEO. 
Philip Johnson’s bonus has been pro-rated to reflect the time he has 
been with the business in the year.
Further details as to how bonuses have been determined are set 
out in the annual report on remuneration.
The Committee has reviewed the performance criteria set for the 
2014 LTIP grant and has determined that none of the awards will 
vest over the three year period ending 30 June 2017 .

Directors’ remuneration report
Directors’ remuneration policy 
The tables below summarise the main elements of the remuneration 
package for Directors and will be effective from the date approved 
by shareholders in 2017 until shareholders next consider and vote 
on the policy (intended to be three years from the date of approval).
The Company’s policy is designed to ensure that remuneration 
supports the Company’s strategic objectives, is appropriately 
positioned against the external market, and provides fair rewards 
which will attract, retain and motivate individuals of the calibre 
required to run a group of the scale and complexity of Hargreaves 
Lansdown. 
The policy is divided into separate sections for Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. 
Executive Directors
Component/ 
purpose and link to strategy
Operation and performance measures Maximum opportunity
Base salary 
Reflects the individual’s 
responsibilities, experience 
and contribution.
Supports the recruitment 
and retention of the calibre 
of individuals required to 
lead the Company.
Base salaries are reviewed annually, with any increase usually effective from 
1 July.
Base salaries are set taking into account a range of factors including external 
remuneration levels and remuneration levels within the Group, as well as an 
individual’s responsibilities, experience and contribution.
Base salary will ordinarily increase by no more than the average of relevant staff 
increases. Any increase beyond this would only be made in exceptional 
circumstances, which would be explained by the Remuneration Committee.
No prescribed maximum 
increase.
Annual Performance 
Bonus
Rewards achievement of the 
Group’s business plan, key 
performance indicators and 
the personal contribution 
of Directors. 
Aligns the interests of 
Directors with those of 
shareholders.
The level of Annual Performance Bonus payable is linked to key financial metrics 
as well as corporate and individual performance against objectives.
The on-target bonus for each Director as a percentage of base salary will be 
disclosed in advance in the Annual Report on Remuneration for each year.
Performance will be assessed against a combination of financial/growth, 
non-financial and individual measures over a one-year period. There is no 
prescribed weighting of particular metrics, but financial performance is central 
to the decision-making process.
In assessing the overall performance outcome, the Remuneration Committee 
will use its judgement to consider:
• The extent to which market movements, investor sentiment, interest rates 
and regulation, all of which are beyond the control of the Directors, have 
impacted the performance. This may result in either reductions or increases 
in the rewards that would otherwise have been granted;
• The extent to which management has operated within the agreed risk 
parameters; and
• The extent to which the bonus outcome reflects the overall performance of 
the business in the context of shareholder experience.
40% of the Annual Performance Bonus is subject to compulsory deferral into nil 
cost options for a period of three years. Dividend alternatives will accrue on 
deferred awards and will be paid at the time of vesting. 
At the discretion of the Committee, the immediately payable element of the 
Annual Performance Bonus may be paid as cash or as an additional employer 
pension contribution.
Any unvested deferred awards are subject to a formal malus mechanism. 
The non-deferred element of bonus awards are subject to clawback for 
three years from the date of award.
The maximum bonus 
opportunity for Directors 
under the policy is three and a 
half times base salary in 
respect of the relevant 
financial year.
The aggregate value of 
bonuses payable to all 
members of the Executive 
Committee (including the 
Executive Directors) is capped 
at 5% of profit before tax for 
that year. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
59 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Component/ 
purpose and link to strategy
Operation and performance measures Maximum opportunity
Sustained 
Performance Plan
Aligns the interests of 
Directors with those of 
shareholders and rewards 
long-term stewardship of 
the Company. 
Annual awards of nil cost options will vest over a five year period, subject to the 
achievement of underpinning performance conditions over the vesting period.
The grant of awards will be subject to satisfactory personal performance of each 
Director in the period prior to grant. The underpinning performance conditions 
applicable for each award will be disclosed upfront in the remuneration report.
Dividend alternatives will accrue on unvested awards and will be paid at the time 
of vesting.
Any unvested awards will be subject to a formal malus mechanism.
The maximum award each 
year under the Policy is half 
times base salary.
Shareholding guideline 
Aligns the interests of 
management and 
shareholders in the success 
of the Group.
Directors have six years from appointment to the Board to achieve a 
shareholding with a minimum value of three times base salary.
Vested but unexercised nil cost options under the annual performance bonus are 
included in the calculation of a Director’s shareholding. Unvested nil cost options 
under the Sustained Performance Plan and previous LTIP are not included.
Not applicable.
Pension 
Provides adequate pension 
saving arrangements for 
Directors and staff.
Pension provision is provided in line with the pension provision for all staff. 
Any changes made to the staff arrangements will be carried across to the 
Directors.
The Committee may amend the form of any Director’s pension arrangements in 
response to changing pension legislation or similar developments, so long as 
any amendment does not increase the cost to the Company of a Director’s 
pension provision by any greater percentage than the increase to the provision 
for all other staff.
All staff and Directors may waive an element of their Annual Performance Bonus 
in return for a corresponding employer’s contribution into their pension.
The Company will pay a cash allowance in place of an employer pension 
contribution where a Director has reached the Lifetime Allowance or would 
exceed the annual limit or has opted out where they have elected to protect their 
Lifetime Allowance.
A defined contribution 
pension arrangement is 
provided for all employees, 
with an employer contribution 
of 5% of base salary.
Where employees make 
additional contributions of 
over 5% of salary, these will be 
double matched by the 
Company to a maximum value 
of a further 6% of salary.
Any contribution paid as a 
result of waiver of the cash 
element of an Annual 
Performance Bonus will not be 
counted towards these 
maxima and will not attract 
matched funding.
Benefits 
An ‘across the board’ 
benefits package is 
available both to staff and 
Directors alike.
All eligible staff and Directors may take up a range of benefits.
Where costs are necessarily incurred in the performance of duties on behalf of 
the Company, those costs will be reimbursed in full, e.g. travel, accommodation, 
subsistence, relocation, and any tax and social costs arising.
Provision of tax efficient benefits such as pension contributions, additional 
holiday, childcare vouchers and workplace parking is available through a salary 
sacrifice mechanism.
Group life insurance and Group permanent health insurance is provided to all 
staff with greater than six months’ continuous service.
All eligible staff (as defined by the scheme rules and which includes Executive 
Directors) may participate in the Save As You Earn scheme or Share Incentive 
Plan.
Appropriate Director insurance and indemnity cover is provided by the Company.
Some Company services are provided at a reduced cost on the same basis as for 
all other employees.
The maximum value of 
benefits will depend on the 
cost of the provision of those 
benefits.
There are a number of 
variables and unknowns 
impacting the maximum 
payable in the event of 
relocation; however, the 
Committee would approve 
no more than is necessary 
in such situations. 60 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Directors’ remuneration report
Directors’ remuneration policy 
Changes from previous policy
The following changes have been incorporated within the 
Remuneration Policy compared to the previous policy approved by 
shareholders on 24 October 2014:
• Base salary – we have now stated that this will ordinarily increase 
by no more than the average of relevant staff increases. Any 
increase beyond this would only be made in exceptional 
circumstances, which would be explained by the Remuneration 
Committee. Previously there was no formal link to the average of 
relevant staff increases;
• Annual bonus – the maximum opportunity has been reduced 
from five times base salary to three and a half times base salary. 
A commitment has been made to a higher level of disclosure, 
including advance disclosure of on-target bonus opportunities as 
a percentage of salary;
• Annual bonus deferral – the level of deferral required has 
increased from 30% to 40% of total bonus. Deferral is now wholly 
into nil cost options whereas previously it could optionally be 
deferred entirely into cash;
• Sustained Performance Plan – under this new plan, annual 
awards of nil cost options of up to half times base salary will be 
granted, with a five year vesting period. This replaces the 
previous LTIP under which market value options of up to two and 
a half times base salary with a vesting period of three years were 
granted annually until 2015;
• Shareholding guideline – has increased from two times base 
salary under previous policy to three times base salary;
• Pension – employer pension contributions will be increased from 
4% to 5% of salary for all employees from 1 October 2017 . A new 
matching arrangement for employee pension contributions will 
also apply from this date; and
• The section of the policy entitled ‘Special arrangements for 
Founding Executive Directors’ has been removed from the policy 
as Peter Hargreaves is no longer a member of the Board.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, this Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
includes authority for the Group to honour any commitments 
entered into before the Directors’ Remuneration Policy came 
into effect.
Changes in legislation or regulation
Authority is given for the Group to comply with all prevailing 
legislation and statutory regulation both current and future, 
making the minimum changes to this policy in order to comply. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will set a remuneration package for new Executive 
Directors determining the individual elements of the package and 
the total package, taking account of the skills and experience of the 
candidate, the market rate for the role, and remuneration levels 
across the Group, respecting maximum levels for variable pay 
referred to in the appropriate policy table. 
Additional cash and/or share-based awards on a one-off basis may 
be made as deemed appropriate by the Committee if the 
circumstances require taking into account pay or benefits forfeited 
by a Director on leaving a previous employer. The Committee has 
the discretion to make such awards under the Unapproved Share 
Option Plan 2012 or the Sustained Performance Plan and in excess 
of the salary limits contained therein, or as permitted under Rule 
9.4.2 of the Listing Rules (which allows companies to make one-off 
share awards in exceptional circumstances, including recruitment). 
Such awards will, as far as possible, maintain consistency with the 
awards forfeited in terms of type of reward (shares or cash), 
expected value, time horizons and whether they were subject to 
performance criteria. Other payments may be made for relocation 
expenses, recruitment from abroad, legal costs, other costs or 
benefits forfeited by an individual being recruited. No of payment 
made on appointment will be deemed to be included within the 
aggregate Executive bonus cap calculation. 
Service agreements and loss of office payments
All Executive Directors have a service contract which reflects the 
approved policy in force at the time of appointment. The service 
contracts for all Directors in post are available for viewing (on the 
giving of reasonable notice) at our registered office during normal 
business hours and both prior to and at the AGMeeting. Under the 
terms of the Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors are 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
Our policy is that service contracts do not have a specific duration 
but may be terminated with 12 months’ notice from the Company or 
the Executive Director.
The service contracts contain no provision for liquidated damages 
for compensation on termination, except for those set out in the 
table below. The service agreements contain provisions for 
payment in lieu of notice in respect of base salary and pension 
contributions, but these are at the Company’s sole discretion.
The Committee has a policy framework for payments for loss of 
office by an Executive Director, both in relation to the service 
contract and incentive pay, which is summarised opposite. The 
approach of the Company on any termination is to consider all 
relevant circumstances, including the recent performance of the 
Executive Director, and to act in accordance with any relevant rules 
or contractual provisions. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
61 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Nature of termination By Executive Director or 
Company giving notice 
(excluding special 
circumstances).
By Company summarily. Good leaver: leaving by reason of death, ill health,

agreement of the Committee, the sale of employing 
business or company, or other special circumstances 
at the discretion of the Committee.

Deferred bonus award Deferred bonus awards 
lapse when employment 
ceases.
Deferred bonus awards

Vested unexercised, and 
unvested long-term 
incentive awards lapse

Committee may determine awards to vest early 
subject to performance at the date when 
employment ceases. In either case, the Committee 
will pro-rate award to reflect performance period that 
has been worked, except in the case of serious ill 
health or death when no pro-rating will apply.
Sustained 
Performance Plan 
(SPP) awards
Within first three years of 
award, unvested awards 
lapse when employment 
ceases.
After three years from 
awards, unvested awards 
will continue to vest in full 
on the original terms 
subject to achievement of 
the performance 
underpins.
Vested unexercised, and 
unvested SPP awards lapse 
when employment ceases.
Within first three years of award, unvested awards 
will vest in accordance with the original terms, on a 
pro-rata basis for the period of time served as a 
proportion of the initial three years, subject to 
achievement of the performance underpins.
After three years from awards, unvested awards will 
continue to vest in full on the original terms subject 
to achievement of the performance underpins.
Other payments None. None. Possible disbursements such as legal costs, 
outplacement services and the cost of a settlement 
agreement.
Provisions on a takeover and other corporate events
In the event of a takeover or other corporate event, the Committee 
shall determine the amount (if any) of any bonus payable taking into 
account any applicable performance targets that have been 
achieved and any such factors as it considers appropriate given the 
curtailed performance period.
Deferred bonus awards and outstanding LTIP and Sustained 
Performance Plan awards will vest at that time subject to 
satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions and pro-rated 
to reflect the length of the performance period which has been 
worked (with the Committee having discretion not to pro-rate or to 
reduce pro-rata if it considers it appropriate to do so). Alternatively, 
the Committee may determine with the agreement of the acquiring 
company that awards may be exchanged for equivalent awards in 
another company. 62 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Directors’ remuneration report
Directors’ remuneration policy 
Illustration of application of Remuneration Policy
The Committee discloses each year in the Group’s annual report a bar 
chart that models the potential remuneration for each of the Executive 
Directors for the forthcoming year using a range of assumptions. The 
chart shows the potential value of the current Executive Directors’ 
remuneration for the forthcoming year for three scenarios; ‘minimum’, 
‘maximum’ and ‘mid-point scenario’ as follows:
• The minimum amount represents the unconditional components of the 
remuneration package: salary, pension and employee benefits; 
• The mid-point amount is the amount the Executive Director will 
receive if they achieve an ‘on-target’ bonus level and awards under 
the Sustained Performance Plan vest in full. It will include both fixed 
and variable components of remuneration; and 
• The maximum level is the maximum amount of remuneration each 
Executive Director can be awarded in the year. The maximum is 
subject to the remuneration caps that have been established for 
each component.

Component/Purpose Operation
Basic fee
Supports the attraction and retention of 
high performing individuals, considering 
both the market value of the position and 
the individual’s skills, experience and 
performance.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ basic fees are reviewed annually by those responsible.
Fee increases, if applicable, are normally effective from 1 July.
The fee levels are set taking into account market data for comparable positions, taking account of 
the time commitment required for the role. 
All Non-Executive Directors’ fees including those below are paid in cash on a quarterly basis.
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension, or to participate in any Group 
employee share plan.
Committee chairman and 
committee member fees 
Recognises the additional time 
commitment and responsibility involved 
in chairing or being a member of a 
committee of the Board.
Each Non-Executive Director receives an additional fee for each committee for which they are 
chairman or a member.
The committee chairman fees reflect the additional time and responsibility in chairing a committee 
of the Board, including time spent in preparation and liaising with management, and the time 
spent attending and preparing for a committee of the Board. The committee member fees reflect 
the additional time and responsibility in holding that role.
Senior Independent Director 
(SID) fee 
Recognises the additional time 
commitment and responsibility involved 
in holding the role of the SID.
The SID receives an additional fee for his or her role.
The fee reflects the additional time and responsibility in fulfilling the role of Senior Independent

Benefits and expenses 
To appropriately reimburse the Chairman

Company’s expenses policy.
Appropriate Director insurance and indemnity cover is provided by the Company.
Some Group services are provided at a reduced cost, on the same basis as for all other employees.
No other benefits are made available to Non-Executive Directors. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
63 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
The maximum aggregate remuneration for Non-Executive Directors 
is set in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the Committee will set the fee level consistent with the approved 
policy at the time of appointment having due regard to 
remuneration paid for comparable positions, taking account of the 
time commitment required for the role.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are contracted under a 
letter of appointment. These letters of appointment cover the terms 
of their appointment, including the time commitment expected. 
Each appointment is for an initial fixed term of three years from the 
commencement date subject to election by shareholders at the first 
AGM following their appointment and annual re-election thereafter.
Either party may terminate the appointment upon three calendar 
months’ written notice and the Company may do so with immediate 
effect subject to a payment in lieu of notice. Should termination 
arise as a result of a resolution of shareholders in general meeting, 
or as a result of a failure to be re-appointed by the shareholders, 
Non-Executive Directors will not be entitled to receive any fees in 
respect of any period after the termination date. No compensation 
is payable on termination, other than for accrued fees and expenses.
The letters of appointment for all Directors in post are available for 
viewing (on the giving of reasonable notice) at our registered office 
during normal business hours and both prior to and at the AGM.
General
External Board appointments
The Company recognises that external Non-Executive Directorships 
are beneficial to both the Director and the Company and that its 
Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive 
Directors of other companies. Such non-executive duties can 
broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit the 
Company. Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are 
allowed to accept a maximum of two non-executive appointments 
and retain the fees received, provided that appointments are not 
likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
Consultation with employees
While the Committee does not consult directly with employees in 
respect of the Directors’ remuneration, it does consider the wider 
salary increase, remuneration arrangements and employment 
conditions across the wider employee population when setting the 
Remuneration Policy for Directors.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee recognises that Director remuneration is an area of 
particular interest to our shareholders and in setting and 
considering changes to remuneration it is critical that we listen to 
and take into account their views. 
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation 
to the AGM each year at its first meeting following the AGM. This 
feedback, as well as any additional feedback received during any 
other meetings with shareholders, is then considered as part of the 
Company’s annual review of the Remuneration Policy. 
We also regularly engage with our largest shareholders to ensure 
we understand the range of views which exist on remuneration 
issues. When any material changes are made to the policy, the 
Committee will discuss these in advance with our major 
shareholders wherever practical. The Committee will also consult 
with professional advisers to ensure we consider current market 
and industry practices, where appropriate. 64 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Directors’ remuneration report
Annual report on remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups Regulations 2013. It also meets the 
requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The Remuneration Committee 
confirms throughout the financial year that the Company has 
complied with these governance rules and best practice provision.
Role of the Remuneration Committee 
The Board remains ultimately accountable for executive 
remuneration but has delegated this responsibility to the 
Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is therefore responsible for 
determining the Remuneration Policy for the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors of the Company and of the subsidiary 
companies, the Chairman, other members of executive management 
and all other staff who are deemed to be ‘Material Risk Takers’ or 
‘Identified Staff’. The policy is determined with due regard to the 
interests of the Company, the shareholders and the Group, with the 
objective of this being to attract, retain and motivate executive 
management of the quality required to run the Group successfully 
without paying more than is necessary. 
The performance measurement of the Directors and key members 
of senior management and the determination of their annual 
remuneration packages are also undertaken by the Committee. 
For individuals below Director level, the Committee has delegated 
authority for setting individual remuneration packages to a sub 
committee consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief People 
Officer and Group Risk and Compliance Director, which reports to 
the Committee on its decisions. The Committee also ensures that 
the remuneration relationship between the Directors and senior 
employees of the Group is appropriate and that the Remuneration 
Policy complies with the FCA Remuneration Code. Any exceptional 
remuneration arrangements for senior employees are advised to 
the Committee.
Meetings during the year
There were six scheduled meetings during the year and additional 
ad hoc meetings where required. I chair the committee and during 
the year its members were Mike Evans, Shirley Garrood and Stephen 
Robertson. None of the Committee has any personal financial 
interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising 
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the 
business.

Advice to the Committee
The Committee is supported by the Company Secretary, the Chief 
People Officer and the Chief Executive Officer, who are invited to 
attend Committee meetings to provide further background 
information and context to assist the Committee in its duties. No 
Director was involved in discussions regarding the determination of 
their own remuneration.
Throughout the year, the Committee has appointed and been 
advised by Deloitte LLP, which is a signatory to the Code of Conduct  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
65 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
for the provision of independent remuneration advice of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group. Deloitte was invited to continue 
as advisers following a review of service levels. The Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied that the advice it has received was objective 
and independent. The fees payable to Deloitte for this advice were 
£51,700 plus VAT. Fees are determined at the outset of the year to 
cover the range of services it is anticipated the Remuneration 
Committee will require. If additional work is necessary, fees are 
agreed for these additional services. Other services provided to 
Hargreaves Lansdown by Deloitte LLP during the year consisted of 
tax and HR consulting services.
Following a competitive tender process the Committee also 
engaged Willis Towers Watson to provide market benchmarking for 
the Directors and selected senior roles below director level, they 
also provided an update on executive remuneration market trends. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice it has 
received was objective and independent. The fees payable to Willis 
Towers Watson for its services were £32,000 plus VAT. Other 
services provided to Hargreaves Lansdown by Willis Towers Watson 
consisted of the provision of remuneration benchmarking data for 
employees of the Group below Director level.
Implementation of the Remuneration 
Policy in 2018 – Executive Directors 
Salary
The Executive Directors’ base salaries were reviewed in June 2017 . 
In reviewing base salaries the Committee takes into account salaries 
elsewhere across the Group, relevant market data and information 
on remuneration practice in a comparator group of companies in the 
financial sector. As both Executive Directors have been appointed to 
their current roles during the course of the last year, it was not felt 
appropriate to increase either of their appointment salaries.

Annual bonus
For 2018, awards are subject to performance against a balanced 
scorecard. This includes the following Company metrics:
Financial/growth 
measures
Client service 
measures
Strategic 
measures
• Net new business
• Net new clients
• Profit before tax
• Net promoter 
score

capabilities
• Maintaining the 
business
The targets set in relation to these measures are considered to be 
commercially sensitive, but will be disclosed in next year’s report. 
In making an assessment of performance against the targets set, 
the Committee will give due consideration to market movements, 
investor sentiment, interest rates and the impact of regulation, all of 
which are beyond the control of the Executive Directors. They will 
also consider the extent to which management has operated within 
the agreed risk parameters and the extent to which the bonus 
outcome reflects the overall performance of the business in the 
context of the shareholder experience. Details of the Committee’s 
assessment will be given in the remuneration report next year.
Individual performance will be assessed against the following 
objectives:
Individual objectives 
for Chris Hill
Individual objectives 
for Philip Johnson
• Communicate the strategy to 
stakeholders
• Establish operating 
framework to deliver the 
strategy
• Deliver year 1 of the strategic 
plan in a risk controlled 
environment
• Maintain client satisfaction
• Support handover to new 
Chairman and ensure smooth 
induction of new Non-
Executive Directors within the 
business
• Deliver success in Hargreaves 
Lansdown’s financial metrics
• Design and implement a plan 
to make a sustainable 
development to the operations 
function
• Develop finance, company 
secretarial and investor 
relations capabilities
• Optimise the balance sheet
• Build effective partnership 
with CEO
• Become authorised as CF10a

Directors’ remuneration report
Annual report on remuneration
The total value of bonuses paid to members of the Executive 
Committee will remain capped at 5% of profit before tax.
60% of the bonus awarded to each Executive Director will be 
payable in cash following the end of the financial year. 40% of the 
bonus will be deferred into nil cost options over a period of three 
years, subject to continued employment.
Any unvested deferred awards are subject to a formal malus 
mechanism. Non-deferred bonus awards are subject to clawback 
for three years from the date of award.
Sustained Performance Plan (SPP) Subject to shareholder approval 
of the proposed Remuneration Policy, we intend to make the first 
awards under the Sustained Performance Plan immediately 
following the AGM in October 2017 .
Each Executive Director will receive an award of nil-cost options 
with a face value of 50% of base salary, subject to satisfactory 
personal performance in the period pre grant. Awards will vest after 
five years, subject to the achievement of the underpinning 
performance conditions. 
In respect of the initial awards under the Sustained Performance 
Plan these underpinning performance conditions will be:
• A requirement for average assets under administration for the 
last complete financial year prior to vesting to be above the 
average assets under administration for the last complete 
financial year prior to award;
• Maintenance of a satisfactory risk, compliance and internal 
control environment across the plan period; and
• Satisfactory personal performance throughout the plan period. 
The Board will review performance against these underpinning 
conditions in the round, taking into account market movements, the 
external business environment and any significant changes in 
regulation in assessing the extent to which awards should vest. 
Any unvested awards will be subject to a formal malus mechanism.

1 Ian Gorham’s remuneration shown is for the period until he stepped down from the Board on 9 February 2017 . During the period he was in post, he waived £nil of his salary 
(2016: £15,000) in favour of making a higher pension contribution. 
2 Chris Hill’s remuneration for 2017 reflects his role as Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief Executive until 8 February 2017 and as Chief Executive Officer from 9 February 
2017 . The prior year comparatives shown for 2016 reflect the period of the year he was in post from 4 February 2016.
3 Philip Johnson’s remuneration for 2017 relates to the period from his appointment to the Board on 7 April 2017 .
4 The Directors have taken benefits as a sacrifice to their salary. Ian Gorham sacrificed £1,800 (2016: £44,000) in regards of car parking and unpaid leave. Chris Hill sacrificed 
£5,600 (2016: £2,000) in order to fund pension contributions and in regards of car parking. Philip Johnson received £4,250 (2016: £ – ) in lieu of pension contributions as he 
has previously taken Lifetime Protection. The amounts shown as gross basic salary are prior to any exchange into pension or salary sacrifice deductions.
Under ‘Gain on historic options vesting’, the amounts shown are a 
best estimate of amounts to be paid in respect of performance 
periods concluding at the date of the end of the reporting period. 
Other than SAYE options (which are available to Directors on the 
same basis as all employees), and the awards made to Chris Hill on 
joining, no share options without performance criteria have been 
granted to Executive Directors since 7 March 2012. 
Benefits in kind are available to all employees on the same basis. 
For 2017 , benefits included: local car parking scheme; childcare 
vouchers; 4% of base salary employer pension contributions; 
reduced platform fees for holding assets in Vantage; reduced 
dealing charges for self and connected persons; health care; and 
the ability to participate in the Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme.
No Director has a prospective entitlement to a defined benefit 
pension by reference to their length of qualifying service. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Annual bonuses for the 2017 financial year (1 July 2016 to 
30 June 2017) (Audited)
The value of bonuses payable to Executive Directors was 
determined by the Committee based on the performance of the 
Group against a number of financial measures, detailed below, and 
each individual’s performance against the specific objectives set 
for them. 
For the 2017 financial year only, as disclosed in last year’s report the 
value of bonuses payable for performance in line with the business 
plan was increased by 10% (the expected value of previous annual 
LTIP awards) to reflect the absence of the LTIP for that year.
For each Executive Director, their overall bonus has been determined 
by reference to the following target and maximum levels:
On-target
bonus 
opportunity
for 2017
(% of base
salary)
Maximum
bonus 
opportunity
(% of base

Ian Gorham None 400%
Chris Hill 235% 400%
Philip Johnson 206% 400%
These opportunities have been pro rated to reflect each individual’s 
time in role during the financial year.
The total value of bonuses payable to both Executive Directors and 
other members of the Executive Committee is subject to a cap of 
5% of profit before tax, in line with the Policy.
Group performance has been considered in relation to the following 
measures: 
Growth

Net new business £6.354bn £6.905bn £6.01bn +15% The Committee reviewed performance in introducing new assets to 
the business, taking into account current market conditions. AUA 
increased by 28.4% to £79.2bn.
During the year, our share of the platform market increased from 
35.9% to 37 .8% and market share of retail stockbroking increased 
from 25.52% to 29.74%.
Net new clients 101,000 118,000 100,000 +18%
The Committee noted strong growth was also seen in respect of net 
new clients, as 118,000 clients were acquired during the year 
compared to 100,000 last year.
Profit before tax £241m £265.8m £218.9m +21% The Committee reviewed performance in delivering sustainable 
earnings growth, taking into account market consensus at the 
beginning of the year as well as current market conditions and the 
overall 14% increase in the FTSE All Share index over the period. 
Summary: Above target performance
The Committee concluded that the Group has delivered a strong year for growth delivering more assets, more clients and record levels of 
net new business. This growth was delivered within the context of underlying market growth and, while the Committee took this tailwind 
into account, it also concluded that together with the increases in market share, the Group had delivered strong earnings growth within the 
planned resourcing levels. 68 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

Net promoter 
score
60.5% 54.7% +11% The Committee reviewed the levels of service provided to clients recognising that 60.5% was the 
highest score ever, and compares to a three year average of 55.6%.
The review also considered a range of other metrics including the nature and number of 
complaints, the significant increase in processing demands driven by business growth and the 
scalability and performance of technology.
Client 
retention
94.7% 94.3% +0.4% The Committee observed that retention levels again increased over the prior year.
Client service 
measure
272 249 +9% The client service measure is internally constructed and consists of a combination of net 
promoter scores across each of the three key product areas: SIPP, ISA and Fund Share Account 
and client retention rate.
272 is the highest score ever and exceeds both the threshold score of 215 and the maximum of 
265 established as part of the LTIP performance conditions.
Summary: on target performance
The Committee concluded that the business has delivered another good year for client service and acknowledged that, while the metrics 
were all strong, the Executive team’s ambition was for an even higher level of client service.
Strategic delivery 
The Committee reviewed projects that had been delivered during the year against the strategic plan, grouped as follows:
Developing our client service Developing our capabilities Maintaining the business
Launch of two HL Select Equity funds 
Lifetime ISA launch
Release of new mobile app
Completed review of IT development 
location options 
Development and delivery of key 
milestones on people agenda
Development and implementation of 
digital marketing capability. 
Broker Focus transition– completion of final complex 
change projects 
Replacement of stock exchange messaging system
Rationalisation of CASS legal entity structure
Review of controls and performance relating to client 
charges post RDR
Development of risk management framework
The Committee considered the successful delivery of a number of new 
services to clients during the course of the year. As at the end of the 
year, the two HL Select funds now have £0.5bn funds under 
management and Hargreaves Lansdown was one of the first to offer 
the new Lifetime ISA. 14,550 LISA accounts have been opened in the 
year to June 2017 and £36 million is invested through us. We released 
the new mobile app in January and since then there have been over 
486,000 downloads and £72m has been deposited into client 
accounts through the mobile app, a key feature enabled through 
the launch.
The Committee considered the progress made in developing our 
capabilities of people, technology and marketing noting the set-up 
of HL Tech in Warsaw, a number of key initiatives concerning the 
development of culture, skills and expertise to support growth and 
the continued progress in developing our digital footprint. 
Hargreaves Lansdown received 96.3m digital visits for the year to 
April 2017 (up 29% on last year). The Committee also recognised 
the successful delivery of a number of complex projects that, while 
not directly client facing, were fundamental to both maintaining 
a robust and scalable business and supporting the growth 
in volumes.
Specific focus was given to progress on the Active Savings service, 
which had not been delivered during the year. A proof of concept 
has been delivered and significant progress made in developing 
systems infrastructure, obtaining regulatory permissions and 
working with banking partners. However, delivery was not achieved 
within the planned timescale.
Summary: below target performance
Overall, the Committee recognised the significant level of delivery 
on strategic items during the year, but its view was weighed heavily 
by the slower than anticipated progress of Active Savings, resulting 
in a summary assessment of below-target performance for 
strategic delivery.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
69 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Individual performance
The Committee has considered each individual Director’s 
performance against his or her personal objectives to ensure that 
awards are made where performance so merits and that they had 
individually not taken any inappropriate behaviour. No such 
concerns were raised during the year.
Ian Gorham’s objectives were discussed in the equivalent report 
last year. Early in the first half of the year when it became evident 
that the handover of responsibilities would happen earlier than 
predicted, we disclosed a new objective of ensuring a complete and 
robust handover of responsibilities was added. Two further 
objectives existed which remain commercially sensitive.

Total bonuses awarded
Each Director’s bonus has been pro-rated to reflect their time in the 
role during the financial year. The resulting bonuses for the 
year ending 30 June 2017 , taking into account both Group and 
personal performance were:
Cash

Philip Johnson 145 97 242 62%
Deferral of annual performance bonuses 
40% of the annual performance bonuses will be deferred for three 
years into nil-cost options. 
In last year’s remuneration report we had stated that dividends 
would not be payable on the deferred shares element of 2017 
bonuses as a result of a change in regulatory requirements, but that 
we fundamentally disagreed with the logic of this position. We 
believe that the payment of dividends (or dividend equivalents) is 
an important feature in aligning the interests of executives with 
those of shareholders, and so are pleased to be able to report a 
change in our understanding of the regulatory position such that 
we will now be paying dividends (or equivalents) on unvested 
nil-cost options at the end of the vesting period in line with our 
Remuneration Policy. 
The right to exercise deferred awards will vest after three years 
provided the individual remains employed by the Group.
Malus and clawback
The 60% of bonus paid upfront is subject to clawback until 
three years from the date of payment. Unvested deferred nil-cost 
options will be subject to a formal malus mechanism. 70 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

At the time of grant, the Director received an award of options over 55,000 shares, with scaled vesting dependent on performance against 
the targets set. The vesting schedule was set such that provided the threshold was achieved, 25% of that part of the option relating to that 
performance condition would vest, rising to vesting in full if the maximum target was met or exceeded. For performance between the 
minimum and maximum targets, vesting is pro-rated on a straight line basis between 25% and 100%.
For the participant, nil options of the 55,000 granted will vest. 
The 2013 LTIP vested during the year and 33,036 options of the 50,000 granted vested for each participant. The share price on the date of 
vesting, 7 September 2016, was £13.49.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

basis as for all employees. 
3 These are non-performance related awards. The number of shares over which the award was granted was calculated by reference to the share price on 30 June 2016 of 
£12.43. These awards were granted on 12 September 2016. 
4 Savings into SAYE are capped at a maximum of £500 per month.
5 The aggregate exercise price for awards under the deferred bonus scheme is £1 and were granted on 7 April 2017 .
All-employee share plans 
The company operates a SAYE share options scheme and share 
incentive plan (SIP) on the same terms for all employees. All 
employees are encouraged to become shareholders, both through 
direct ownership or through participation in share schemes.
Sourcing shares
The Investment Association guidelines on sourcing shares have 
been followed and, in line with the scheme rules, the Company has 
not issued shares under all employee schemes which, when 
aggregated with awards under all of the Company’s other schemes, 
exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any rolling 10 
year period. The Company has also not issued new shares under 
executive (discretionary) schemes which exceed 5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company in any rolling 10 year period.
Executive Directors’ shareholdings and share interests 
(audited)
The guideline for Executive Directors to accumulate minimum 
personal holdings in Hargreaves Lansdown plc shares amounts to a 
value of two times base salary within six years of appointment to 
the Board. Under the revised Remuneration Policy being presented 
for approval, the guideline will be increased to a value of three 
times base salary, again to be achieved within six years of 
appointment to the Board. 
At the point of stepping down from the Board, Ian Gorham owned 
shares outright, at a level exceeding his required shareholding as 
described above based on a share price of £13.53 (being the closing 
price on 9 February 2017). 
Under the current policy Chris Hill has until 30 June 2019 to obtain a 
one times base salary shareholding. Philip Johnson has until 
30 June 2020 to obtain a one times base salary shareholding. 72 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

Pension
No Directors or employees participate in a defined benefit pension 
scheme. The Group operates its own Group Self Invested Personal 
Pension (the “GSIPP”). The Company currently contributes 4% of 
base salary to the scheme which applies to Executive Directors and 
staff. This will increase to 5% of base salary with effect from 
1 October 2017 . 
Employees wishing to make personal contributions to the GSIPP can 
do so via ‘salary exchange’ or ‘bonus waiver’ ensuring that they 
benefit from the maximum, immediate relief from income tax and 
National Insurance. Employees are required to contribute 4%, with 
contribution levels increasing to 5% from 1 October 2017 . Staff, 
Senior Management and Executive Directors may opt out of the 
scheme should they wish. Where an individual has reduced the 
level of their contribution to the GSIPP due to exceeding, or being 
due to exceed, the Lifetime Allowance or Annual Contribution, or 
has opted out where they have elected to protect their Lifetime 
Allowance, the Group will make an additional monthly payment 
equivalent to the employer’s pension contribution amount forsaken.
The Committee confirms that no excess retirement benefits have 
been paid to current or past Directors.
Payments to third parties
The Committee confirms that no amounts have been paid to third 
parties in respect of Directors’ services.
Payments to past Directors (audited)
The Committee confirms that no payments have been made to past 
Directors during the year, with the exception of the exercise of the 
following share awards for Tracey Taylor: 
• Ms Taylor exercised 7 ,713 deferred bonus shares on 6 September 
2016 when the share price was £13.49.
Payments for loss of office (audited)
It was announced in September 2016 that Ian Gorham had decided 
to step down as Chief Executive Officer. He subsequently stepped 
down as CEO on 9 February 2017 , and will remain with the Group 
until 30 September 2017 to ensure a smooth transition. His existing 
conditions of employment will continue in accordance with his 
service contract until this date. The value of emoluments paid for 
the period of the year after he had stepped down from the Board 
was £219,907 .
Mr Gorham remained eligible for a reduced pro-rated discretionary 
bonus for the period 1 July 2016 to 9 February 2017 commensurate 
with standing down as CEO part way through the year. Details of 
this bonus are set out within the table headed ‘Remuneration 
payable for the 2017 financial year’. The Remuneration Committee 
determined that Mr Gorham would be classified as a ‘good leaver’ 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan and as such he will be eligible to 
retain his unvested awards under this plan, pro-rated for time to 
report the proportion of the performance period served prior to the 
cessation of his employment. These awards will remain subject to 
the terms of the plan, including performance conditions.
No other compensation for loss of office will be paid to Mr Gorham.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Role of the Nomination Committee
The Committee is responsible for regularly reviewing the structure, 
size and composition of the Board, with due regard to skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity and making recommendations 
to the Board as to any changes. The Committee leads the process 
for Board appointments, re-election and succession of Directors 
and the Chairman. It is responsible for making recommendations to 
the Board concerning the composition and skills of the Board 
including proposed appointees to the Board and the membership of 
the committees. 
We have a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board. Depending on the 
circumstances of the appointment being made, we consider internal 
candidates, those proposed by either existing Board members or 
via searches performed by the Company or candidates identified 
through the use of external independent search firms. Committee 
members conduct the interview and assessment process, assisted 
where necessary by Executive management. Consideration is given 
to ensure appointees have enough time available to devote to the 
role and that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on 
the Board will be maintained and enriched. When the Committee 
has found a suitable candidate, the Chairman of the Committee 
makes a recommendation to the Board; however, any appointment 
is the responsibility of the Board itself. 
The Committee is responsible for the succession planning for the 
whole Board and senior executives, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Group and the future skills 
and expertise needed on the Board. It is also required to review the 
leadership and development needs of the organisation to allow it to 
compete effectively in its market.

Nomination Committee report
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Nomination Committee, following a very busy year, 
I am pleased to present the Committee’s report for 2017 . Over the 
period, we have completed the appointment process for our new 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chris Hill, and our new Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO), Philip Johnson. We have recommended the 
appointment of two new independent Non-Executive Directors, who 
will be appointed as soon as regulatory approval is received. 
Following the announcement in May 2017 that I intend to stand 
down as Chairman once a suitable replacement has been 
appointed, we have commenced the search for a new Chairman. As 
a key part of this work, we have reviewed the size and composition 
of the Board. We have improved the quality of our succession 
planning within our Executive Team and endorsed the leadership 
and development plans.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

The Committee meets at least twice a year, there were five 
scheduled meetings during the financial year and additional ad hoc

members at 30 June 2017 were Christopher Barling, Shirley Garrood, 
Stephen Robertson and Jayne Styles. The Chief Executive and the 
Chief People Officer have been routinely invited to attend meetings 
as required. A sub-committee of the Nomination Committee has 
been established to undertake the Chairman recruitment process, 
and this sub-committee has met twice during the year.

Diversity
When assessing new appointments to our Board, we review 
carefully the combined skills and experience of the existing Board 
members to determine what characteristics we are looking for from 
a new Director. Each member of the Board must have the skills, 
experience and character that will enable each Director to 
contribute both individually, and as part of the team, to the 
effectiveness of the Board and the success of the Group. We believe 
that diversity amongst Board members is of great value but that 
diversity is a far wider subject than just gender. We will give careful 
consideration to issues of overall Board balance and diversity in 
making new appointments to the Board. 
As at 30 June 2017 , the Board numbers seven in total, of which two 
are Executive and five independent (including the Chairman). 
Female Directors constitute 29% of the Board and 10% of the 
Executive Committee. Subject to the requirements set out above, 
we will aim to maintain female representation on the Board at least 
at the current level and give due consideration to increasing the 
level if, and when, appropriate candidates are available when Board 
vacancies arise. We are committed to maintaining a diverse 
workforce at all levels across the Group and more information on 
how we do this can be found in the Our People section. A copy of 
our full statement on Board Diversity can be found at www.hl.co.uk.
Main activities during the financial year
During the year, the Committee completed the approval and 
appointment process of our new CEO, Chris Hill, who had previously 
held the position of CFO, having joined us in February 2016. The 
Committee undertook a full assessment of Chris’s abilities, 
including a comparison against the experience and skills required 
for the CEO role, and commissioned an externally facilitated 
psychometric profile. The Committee concluded that Chris was the 
right person to lead the Group in the delivery of the next phase of 
its growth and recommended to the Board that he be promoted to 
Deputy CEO in September 2016 with a view to becoming CEO after 
a suitable handover process from the outgoing CEO, Ian Gorham. 
Following regulatory approval, Chris was appointed CEO in 
April 2017 .
The Committee commenced and completed the search for a 
replacement CFO, using the services of Spencer Stuart & Associates 
Limited, an independent executive search agency. The search was 
focused on individuals with appropriate experience in the financial 
services sector, with an evaluation of skills, experience and 
knowledge required for the role, and with due regard to the benefits 
of a diverse Board. The Committee oversaw a rigorous assessment 
process and was pleased to recommend the appointment of Philip 
Johnson to the Board. Philip joined the Company in February 2017 
and following regulatory approval was appointed to the Board as 
CFO in April 2017 .
One of the recommendations of the Board review of 2016 was to 
appoint at least one additional Non-Executive Director. Given the 
need to prioritise the Executive changes, the Committee 
commenced a search mid-year, also using Spencer Stuart & 
Associates Limited for two new Non-Executive Directors. The 
Nomination Committee considered the combination of skills and 
experience required to fulfil the Board’s purpose and to provide 
appropriate challenge. There was a well-defined specification for 
these appointments with a clear understanding of the attributes 
and values required to help the effective functioning of the whole 
Board with appropriate acknowledgement of the need for diversity 
in the composition of the Board. In June 2017 the Committee 
recommended to the Board the appointment of two new 
independent Non-Executive Directors, who will be appointed as 
soon as regulatory approval is received.  78 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Governance
Nomination Committee report
Having agreed a role definition defining the skills and experience 
required for a new Chairman, in May 2017 , the Committee 
commenced a broad search using Zygos Limited, an independent 
executive search agency. This search is being led by a sub-
committee of the Nomination Committee, chaired by the Senior 
Independent Director.
During the year, the Committee has also overseen the assessment 
process for Heather Cooper, who was appointed to the Executive 
Committee in February 2017 as Chief People Officer. 
In June 2017 , the Committee received and discussed a detailed 
review of succession planning for the Executive Directors and senior 
management within the Group.

Role of the Board Risk Committee
The Committee is a forward looking committee of the Board of 
Hargreaves Lansdown plc, seeking to anticipate potential issues by 
assessing known or foreseeable risks and thereby enabling the 
Group to take action to avoid or mitigate the impact of those risks.
The responsibilities of the Committee are set out in its terms of 
reference, which are designed to assist the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities:
• Advising the Board on the Group’s overall risk appetite, risk 
tolerance and risk strategy, taking into account the current and 
prospective macroeconomic and financial environment;
• Overseeing and advising the Board on the current risk exposures 
of the Group and future risk strategy;
• Advising the Board on the amount of surplus regulatory capital 
that should be held commensurate with the Group’s risk profile 
and regulatory obligations;
• Overseeing the effectiveness of the risk management procedures, 
including AIFMD and the principal risks and uncertainties relating 
to the Group and the steps being taken to mitigate them;
• Reviewing and recommending to the Board the Group’s ICAAP; 
• Identifying and assessing future potential risks which, by virtue of 
their unfamiliarity, uncertainty and deemed low probability may 
not have been factored adequately into review elsewhere within 
the Group; and
• Continuously monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal controls and understanding how these affect the 
risk profile of the business.
The Committee reports its findings to the Board, identifies matters 
for which action or improvement is needed, and recommends 
appropriate steps. However, the Board retains ultimate 
responsibility for reviewing and approving the overall risk appetite 
of the business.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about the 
work of the Committee.

On an ongoing basis, membership of the Committee is reviewed by 
the Chairman of the Committee and any recommendations for new 
appointments are made to the Nomination Committee for onward 
recommendation to the Board. Appointments are for a period of 
three years and are extendable for further periods of up to three 
years provided the Director still meets the criteria for membership 
of the Committee.
Main activities during the year 
In discharging its responsibilities the Committee concentrated on 
the following areas:
Risk reporting and risk profile discussions
The Committee has received reports from the Risk department at 
each Committee meeting as well as ad hoc reports from other areas 
of the business on request. Regular topics of discussion have 
included dealing statistics, conduct risk (through the conduct risk 
key risk indicators), escalation reports with associated learnings 
and the departmental risks. The Committee has challenged the 
business where trends and data suggest further action is required. 
The Committee believes the management of the risk profile is given 
sufficient consideration and that necessary action has been taken 
with appropriate governance and oversight
Emerging risks
Emerging risks have been an agenda item at each Committee 
meeting during the period. Papers have been submitted by the 
Executive Risk Committee covering a variety of emerging risks. 
These matters have been discussed and challenged and the 
Committee has provided considered guidance on a variety of 
external emerging risks. Topics which have been discussed by the 
Committee include a variety of systemic, regulatory, political, 
technological and internal change risks.
Fraud and cyber risk
The Committee is acutely aware of the industry exposure to both 
fraud and cyber risk, and this is reflected in the frequency with 
which it is discussed at the Committee. During the period an 
anti-fraud strategy was presented to the Committee by the Head of 
Client Protection. The strategy is focused on enhancing existing 
controls and reviewing emerging threats.
MLRO update
The Committee has received a number of reports from the MLRO 
providing updates to the Committee. Updates included regulatory 
changes regarding overseas clients and staff training requirements.
Commercial update
The Committee has received reports from the Commercial Director 
at each Committee meeting. Regular topics of discussion included 
competition risk, client outcomes and business volumes.
Operations update
The Committee has received reports from the Head of Operations at 
each Committee meeting. Regular topics of discussion included 
improvements to the control framework, resource planning and the 
culture within the operations teams. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

IT update
The Committee has received reports from the Chief Information 
Officer at each Committee meeting. Regular topics of discussion 
included IT security, strategic projects and the development hub 
in Warsaw.
ICAAP 
The Committee approved and recommended for Board approval 
the Hargreaves Lansdown ICAAP on 26 January 2017 . Prior to the 
Committee’s approval, separate ICAAP challenge and review 
sessions were run with both the Board and the Executives. 
Understanding of the ICAAP and using it as an element of risk 
management challenge to the business is integral to the Committee, 
with specific agenda items dedicated to the constituent elements 
including reverse stress testing, stress and scenarios and wind 
down plans.
Risk framework and governance
The Committee reviewed a report from the Chief Risk Officer 
regarding the design and effectiveness of the risk management 
framework, including the introduction of a new Executive Risk 
Committee. The Executive Risk Committee is chaired by the Group 
Director of Risk & Compliance. Its role is to oversee the day-to-day 
risk management across the Group as set out on page 44. It meets 
monthly with attendance from members of the Executive 
Committee supported by senior management and subject matter 
experts. A monthly CASS Committee has been formed to 
specifically focus on the Group’s CASS risks and compliance.
Remuneration schemes governance
The Committee provided support and input to the Remuneration 
Committee by reviewing a report from the Chief Risk Officer covering 
the appropriateness of the remuneration schemes upon the Group’s 
risk profile.
Risk effectiveness
During the year, the Committee has overseen a range of 
improvements in both the capacity of the risk team, and the 
embeddedness of the framework. These measures have all 
increased the effectiveness of risk management. The Chairman of 
the Committee has been in regular contact with the Head of Internal 
Audit throughout the year. At its meeting in June 2017 , the 
Committee received and approved the annual reports on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
process and risk team, the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment and the effectiveness of compliance.

Annual General Meeting 
At the AGM on 11 October 2017 , the following five items of special 
business will be tabled:
1. Authority to purchase own shares: The Company was granted 
authority at the AGM in 2016 to purchase its own shares up to an 
aggregate value of 10% of the issued nominal capital. This authority 
expires at this year’s AGM and a special resolution will be proposed 
for its renewal.
This resolution gives the Directors authority to make market 
purchases of up to 47 ,431,862 ordinary shares, representing 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital at 14 August 2017 . The Directors do not have any present 
intention to exercise such authority and the authority will expire 
at the conclusion of the next AGM after the passing of the 
proposed resolution.
2. and 3. Directors’ authority to allot shares and waiver of pre-
emption rights: Resolutions are to be proposed as special business 
at the AGM on 11 October 2017 to enable the Directors to allot 
unissued shares and, subject to the limits therein contained, to allot 
shares for cash other than to existing shareholders in proportion to 
their shareholdings.
Allotment of shares – This resolution renews the Directors’ 
authority to allot shares. The maximum nominal value of relevant 
securities that may be allotted pursuant to the authority is 
£632,424.80, representing 158,106,200 ordinary shares. This 
amount represents approximately 33.3% of the Company’s total 
share capital in issue as at 14 August 2017 .
 Waiver of pre-emption rights – This resolution renews the 
Directors’ authority to issue new shares for cash, without following 
the statutory pre-emption procedures, so long as: (i) the issue is a 
rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer, or pursuant to a 
scrip dividend alternative; or (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of 
such issue does not exceed £94,863.72 (which represents 5% of the 
issued share capital as at 14 August 2017). 
The Directors do not have any present intention of exercising either 
of the authorities and the authorities will expire at the conclusion of 
the next AGM.
These resolutions seek authorities which are in accordance with the 
current guidelines issued by the Investment Committees of the 
Association of British Insurers and the National Association of 
Pension Funds. 
4. Approval of short notice for general meetings. The Company was 
granted authority at the AGM in 2017 to call a general meeting on 
no less than 14 clear days’ notice. This authority expires at this 
year’s AGM and a special resolution will be proposed for its renewal.
5. Adoption of a new executive share option scheme: A resolution is 
being proposed as special business at the AGM to enable the 
Directors to adopt a new executive share option scheme. 
Further details of the proposals are included within the Directors’ 
remuneration report, and full details will be provided in the 
shareholders’ Notice of AGM.
PwC have expressed their willingness to accept appointment as 
auditor and a resolution to appoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a 
longer period than the 12 months required by the Going Concern 
provision. Details of the assessment can be found in the operating 
and financial review section of the strategic report.
Going concern
In conjunction with its assessment of longer-term viability above, 
the Board concluded that it remained appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements as it believes the Group will continue to be in 
business, with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, 
ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to 
laws or regulations for a period of at least 12 months from the date 
of approval of the Group financial statements.

Report and Financial Statements confirms that:
• So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• The Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken

The Directors are responsible for  
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance  
with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company and of the profit or loss of the Group and parent 
company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• State whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for 
the Company financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and parent 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and parent company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the parent company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and 
parent company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Hargreaves Lansdown plc’s group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the group’s profit and 
the group’s and the parent company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Report and Financial Statements 2017 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position as at 30 June 2017 , the consolidated income statement 
and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and parent company statements of cash flows and the 
consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to 
the group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 1.4 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the group or the parent 
company in the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017 .

Our audit approach
Context
Hargreaves Lansdown plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and its principal activity is the provision of regulated investor investment 
services to UK retail clients. As a result, key focus areas for Hargreaves Lansdown plc are on growing assets under administration and 
operating within a highly regulated market. These activities provide the context for our audit.
In the year there have been no significant transactions or business reorganisations outside the normal course of business and no 
significant changes in regulation that impact Hargreaves Lansdown plc.

Key audit
matters
Materiality 
Audit scope
• We performed a full scope audit of the complete financial information of two individually 
financially significant reporting units, which together represent 99.5% of the group’s profit 
before tax.
• Specific audit procedures were also performed over consolidation adjustments, balances that 
could be tested at a group level which included intangible assets, staff costs, cash and cash 
equivalents, term deposits and material movements through the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity.
• Revenue recognition (group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  92 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Hargreaves Lansdown plc continued
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (refer to the audit committee report and 
note 1.1 to the financial statements)
Revenue recognition is a key audit matter as revenue is significantly 
material to the group and is an important determinant of the group’s 
profitability.
Further, there are incentive schemes in place for Directors and staff 
which are in part based on the group’s revenue performance. Where 
there are incentives based on performance, there is an inherent risk 
of fraud in revenue recognition as there is an incentive to overstate 
revenue. Revenue may also be misstated due to errors in system 
calculations or manual processes, for example, arising from 
incorrect securities prices or levels of assets held used in these 
calculations and processes.
We assessed each revenue stream for the two in-scope reporting 
units and determined that there is a significant risk based on the 
opportunity for errors to occur in each of these revenue streams. 
Our assessment of the risks for each revenue type which we needed 
to obtain evidence over is as follows:
Type of revenue Description, including fraud risk factors
Asset and 
transaction based 
revenue streams 
calculated by the 
underlying 
administration 
system
Management fees on 
SIPPs and ISAs
Platform fees
Stockbroking 
commission
Other income
These revenue streams are either calculated 
based on the value of assets held or based 
on activities undertaken by the client of the 
group, such as stockbroking.
The value of securities and all client 
activities is held in the underlying 
administration system which supports the 
Vantage and PMS platforms. The rates are 
derived from standard rate tables. 
Unauthorised changes to, or errors in these 
inputs could lead to a misstatement of 
revenue.
Asset and transaction based revenue streams
To address the risk identified in the asset and transaction based 
revenue streams calculated by the underlying administration 
system, we independently re-calculated the revenue recognised. 
This covered management fees, platform fees and an element of 
stockbroking commission. Our calculations were based on data 
extracted from the administration system.
In order to rely on the data extracted, we:
• Reconciled transactional data provided from opening positions 
through to closing positions of individual securities held; and
• Tested a sample of transactions to supporting documentation 
such as client instructions and a sample of security positions to 
stock reconciliations and external sources (such as fund manager 
statements).
This testing provided sufficient evidence for us to determine the 
data extracted was reliable for the purposes of performing the 
recalculations.
We tested the inputs of our recalculations by agreeing standing 
data, such as fee structures, commission rates and security prices 
to supporting evidence on a sample basis. No exceptions were 
noted from testing the standing data.
On the basis of this testing, we determined it was appropriate for us 
to use the standing data to perform our independent recalculation 
of each of the revenue streams.
We compared our independent recalculations to the amount 
reported and noted differences that, in our view, were trivial and 
required no further investigation.
We tested the remaining asset and transaction based revenue 
within the two in-scope reporting units which included other income 
and an element of stockbroking commission on a sample basis, 
agreeing each revenue item sampled back to supporting 
documentation. No significant exceptions were noted. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

The above key audit matter applies only to

Revenue streams calculated by management or a third party
Annual management charges (‘AMCs’) relating to the Hargreaves 
Lansdown Multi-Manager funds and Select funds
We agreed revenue samples through to cash received evidenced by 
bank statements, recalculated the management fees, and tested a 
control operating at the firm which independently verifies the fund’s 
net asset values provided by the independent third party. We noted 
differences that, in our view, were trivial and required no further 
investigation.
Interest income on client money
On a sample basis, we manually recalculated the gross interest 
earned on client money based on records maintained by 
management and tested these records by agreeing a sample of 
deposits and interest rates to documentation received from the 
relevant bank. No exceptions were noted as part of our testing.
Renewal commission
On a sample basis, we agreed renewal commission to third party 
statements and bank statements. No exceptions were noted as part 
of testing.
All revenue streams
As part of our testing described above, we performed procedures to 
determine that revenue was recognised in the correct period. In 
addition, we tested a sample of journals posted to the general 
ledger based on our assessment of fraud risk. We understood the 
nature of these journals and agreed the appropriateness of the 
journal to supporting documentation. No exceptions were noted 
that were indicative of fraud or error.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the parent company to communicate in our report. 94 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which they operate.
The group is structured as one segment, comprising 20 separate reporting units. There were 7 trading subsidiaries during the year, two of 
which we considered to be financially significant reporting units and on which we performed an audit of their complete financial 
information. Together these two financially significant reporting units represent 99.5% of the group’s profit before tax. An entity was 
considered to be financially significant if it contributed more than 5% of consolidated profit before tax. Specific audit procedures were also 
performed over consolidation adjustments, balances that could be tested at a group level which included intangible assets, staff costs, 
cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and material movements through the consolidated statement of changes in equity. All of the 
audit work was performed by the group engagement team in the UK as all books and records were available at one location.
The parent company is a holding company with investments in subsidiaries in the Hargreaves Lansdown plc group. It does not trade 
outside of the group. The only material income it received during the year was dividend income received from subsidiaries.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £13.2 million (2016: £10.9 million). £9.3 million (2016: £9.5 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
As the group is profit orientated, we have 
calculated materiality with reference to profit 
before tax.
As the parent company is profit orientated, we 
have calculated materiality with reference to profit 
before tax
For each reporting unit in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that was less than our overall group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across reporting units was between £5.1 million and £11.9 million. Certain reporting units were audited to a 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £660,000 (group audit) 
(2016: £540,000) and £465,000 (parent company audit) (2016: £475,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome 
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in respect of the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether 
the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification 
of any material uncertainties to the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date 
of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s 
and parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to going concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.

Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form 
of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform 
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006,(CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described 
below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 24 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 84 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their 
environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules) 96 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:
• The statement given by the directors, on page 35, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and parent company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and parent company obtained 
in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 48 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 86, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the members on 25 October 2013 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 30 June 2014 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 4 years, 
covering the years ended 30 June 2014 to 30 June 2017 .

1.1 Net revenue
Revenue represents fees receivable from financial services provided to clients, net interest income on client money and management fees 
charged to clients. It relates to services provided in the UK and is stated net of value added tax. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Revenue is recognised as follows: 
Management and platform fees are recognised on an accruals basis as they fall due. 
The Group earns fees on transactions entered into on behalf of clients. The fee earned is recorded in the accounts on the date of the 
transaction, being the date on which services are provided to clients and the Group becomes entitled to the income.
Adviser charges are made to clients for providing full portfolio management services and ad-hoc advice to clients on specific financial 
matters. Revenue is recognised at the point at which an agreement is made to provide advice.
Renewal commission is earned on third-party agreements entered into on the advice of the Group's advisory services and is recognised 
on an accruals basis as it becomes due and payable to the Group. 
Renewal commission was also previously earned from fund managers based on the value of assets under the administration of the 
Group held within their funds. From 1 April 2016, as a result of the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), any renewal income was passed 
entirely to clients with neither income nor associated costs being recognised, hence the decrease in the amount in the current period.
Interest income received on client money balances is the net interest margin earned by the Group and is accrued on a time basis, based 
on the client money balances under administration and by reference to the effective interest rate applicable.

1.2 Segmental reporting
Under IFRS 8, operating segments are required to be determined based upon the Group’s internal organisation and management structure 
and the primary way in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is provided with financial information. In the case of the Group, 
the CODM is considered to be the Executive Committee.
In the current period, consideration has been given to the nature of the operating segments previously disclosed and it is the view of the 
Board and of the Executive Committee that there is in fact only one segment, being the Group – a direct-to-investor investment service 
administering investments in ISA, SIPP and Fund & Share accounts, providing services for individuals and corporates. It was considered 
that segmental reporting, as previously presented, did not provide a clearer or more accurate view of the reporting within the Group. 
Given that only one segment exists, no additional information is presented in relation to it, as it is disclosed throughout these 
financial statements.
The Group does not operate in more than one location and, as a result, no geographical segments are reported. 
The Group does not rely on any individual customer and so no additional customer information is reported. 100 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

1.5 Staff costs
Staff costs represent amounts paid to employees in respect of services provided in the year including wages and salaries, share-based 
payment expenses, bonuses, payments to a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme and related social security costs. Amounts 
are recognised on an accruals basis as the services are provided.
Share-based payments are accounted for in line with the policy as outlined in note 1.10.
The Group aims to attract, motivate and retain high calibre employees by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages, 
which may be linked to the creation of long-term shareholder value. Salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the 
employment market generally for employees of comparable status, responsibility and skills. All employees are eligible to be considered 
for an annual discretionary bonus. In addition to cash bonuses, the Group operates various share-based remuneration schemes as 
described in note 1.10. Other pension costs relate wholly to defined contribution schemes.

In addition, the Group has disposed of a number of items of office equipment in the period, leading to a loss – see note 2.3 for further details.
1.8 Tax
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for 
the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable 
right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Factors affecting tax charge for the year
It is expected that the ongoing effective tax rate will remain at a rate approximating to the standard UK corporation tax rate in the medium 
term, except for the impact of deferred tax arising from the timing of exercising of share options which is not under our control. The 
standard UK corporation tax rate was reduced to 19% (from 20%) on 1 April 2017 , and accordingly, the Group’s profits for this accounting 
year are taxed at an effective rate of 19.75%. Deferred tax has been recognised at 19% or 17%, being the rates expected to be in force at the 
time of the reversal of the temporary difference. A deferred tax asset in respect of future share option deductions has been recognised 
based on the Company’s share price as at 30 June 2017 . 
Factors affecting future tax charge
Any increase or decrease to the Company's share price will impact the amount of tax deduction available in future years on the value of 
shares acquired by staff under share incentive schemes. The Finance Act 2015 was enacted on 18 November 2015 and has reduced the 
standard rate of UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020. The Finance Bill 2016 was substantively 
enacted on 6 September 2016 reducing the rate further to 17% from 1 April 2020.

1.9 Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in free issue during the year, including ordinary shares held in the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
reserve which have vested unconditionally with employees. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 
1,213,461 at 30 June 2017 (2016: 1,285,073).

1.10 Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. Share options are expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on management’s best estimate of awards vesting and adjusted for the impact of non-market-
based vesting conditions. Annual revisions are made to the estimate of awards vesting, based on non-market-based vesting conditions. 
The impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to reserves. 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
Any gains or losses on sale of the Company’s own shares held by the EBT are credited or debited directly to the EBT reserve and are 
treated as non-distributable profits.
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Group seeks to facilitate equity ownership by employees, principally through schemes that encourage and assist the purchase of the 
Company’s shares.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
105 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
The Group operates three share option and share award plans: the Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (SAYE), the Hargreaves 
Lansdown plc Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Hargreaves Lansdown Company Share Option Scheme (the Executive Option Scheme).
Awards granted under the SAYE scheme vest over three or five years. Awards granted under the Employee Share Incentive Plan vest over a 
three-year period. Awards granted under the Executive Option Scheme range between vesting at grant date and a maximum of ten years. 
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the market value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. There are currently no 
performance conditions attached to any options granted under any of the schemes, with the exception of the Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) – an executive option scheme, although options are forfeited (in most circumstances) if the employee leaves the Group before the 
options vest.

The expected volatility
The expected Hargreaves Lansdown plc share price volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share 
price since flotation in May 2007 .
Prior to 15 May 2007 , the Company’s shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore, no readily available market price existed for 
the shares. Since 15 May 2007 , a quoted market price has been available for the Company’s shares. 
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions as shown in note 1.5. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

2.1 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is 
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a 
business combination is allocated to the cash-generating unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are reviewed for impairment at least annually as a matter of course, and 
whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs which indicates potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared 
to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

The net carrying value of goodwill relates entirely to the acquisition of Hargreaves Lansdown Pensions Direct Limited (HLPD) now named 
Hargreaves Lansdown Advisory Services Limited (HLAS).
The Group has prepared financial forecasts for the business for the period to June 2020 that show the Group as a whole and HLAS, will 
remain profitable and cash generative. HLAS is profit-making and has a net asset position as at 30 June 2017 , as a result there are no 
factors indicating goodwill is impaired. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
109 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
2.2 Other intangible assets
Intangible assets excluding goodwill
Other intangible assets comprise customer lists, computer software and the Group’s key operating system, which are stated at cost less 
amortisation and any recognised impairment loss. Amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible assets excluding goodwill 
at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over 
its estimated useful life as follows:
Customer list – eight years
The customer list relates to an acquired book of business and does not include internally generated client lists. The carrying value of the 
asset is reviewed for impairment at least every 12 months, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. 
Computer software – over three to eight years
Computer software relates to purchases of licences and software, as well as internally generated systems improvements. The carrying 
values of computer software are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Included in computer software are IT development costs that are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an 
enduring asset, which delivers benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised and in accordance with the recognition criteria of IAS 
38 Intangible assets. Development work has been undertaken in-house by IT staff and management to enhance the key operating 
systems. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 38 the costs are capitalised as an intangible asset and subsequently amortised over 
the estimated useful life of the system of eight years. This key operating system is fundamental to the operation of the platform, which 
holds client assets, enabling revenue to be earned. Where such costs relate to an asset that is not yet fully available for use by the 
business, they have been separately classified as assets under construction, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Assets under construction
Hargreaves Lansdown Savings Limited
In-house development work has also been undertaken in Hargreaves Lansdown Savings Limited to develop a digital cash savings 
product. Demand, and the feasibility for these services, was established in the year to 30 June 2015, and subsequently, a business plan 
was constructed that formed part of the strategic initiatives approved by the Board. Development commenced in the year to 30 June 
2016 and the Group is committed to the completion and launch of the services in the next financial year and is committed to providing 
the financial resources required to see it through to expected profitability. In accordance with IAS 38 the development costs are being 
capitalised and are recognised initially at cost. 
Impairment of intangible assets excluding goodwill
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows, independent from other assets, 
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher 
of fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 110 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

The amortisation charge above is included in other operating costs in the income statement. 
The customer list is a separately acquired intangible asset and does not include any internally generated element. The remaining 
amortisation period for this asset is seven years. 
Computer software includes externally acquired licences and internally generated system improvements.
During the year the Group has impaired the Peer to Peer lending platform that was previously being developed by Hargreaves Lansdown 
Savings Limited. The impairment impacted both “assets under construction” and “computer software”, leading to a loss of £1.2 million. 
The gross value of costs capitalised was £1.3 million. Other impairments have been made in the period to computer software with 
a carrying value of £0.1m. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
111 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
2.3 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is charged based on the estimates of useful economic lives and expected residual values, which are reviewed annually, for 
all plant and equipment. Management determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on 
experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors, such as any expected changes in technology. The charge 
is calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its 
estimated useful life as follows:
• computer hardware – over three to ten years
• office equipment (which includes fixtures and leasehold improvements) – over three to ten years.
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.

Section 2: Assets and liabilities
2.4 Investments
Investments are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position, on trade date, when the Group becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of an instrument and are initially measured at cost. 
Investments that are designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, being the quoted market price 
of the listed investment, with any gain or loss reported within the income statement. An investment is classified in this category if it is 
held principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term.
Available-for-sale assets are included at cost upon initial recognition and have been subsequently remeasured at fair value. Where it is 
not possible to determine a fair value through the use of a quoted market price or other valuation technique, available-for-sale 
investments are carried at cost. 
The Group derecognises financial assets only when the contractual rights to the cash flows, or substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of ownership from the asset are transferred or expire. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable, as well as the cumulative gain or loss that had been 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, is recognised in profit or loss.

investments and holdings in the HL multi-manager funds as a result of the daily box position – see note 5.8 for more details. 
At the year ended 30 June 2017 , £nil (2016: £0.3 million) are classified as available-for-sale. During the year, the investment previously held 
as available-for-sale, was sold for £4.0 million. This led to a gain of £3.7 million, with the investment previously having been held at cost, 
which has been recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year (see note 1.7).
 2.5 Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into short-term derivative financial instruments as a result of the currency service and overseas trading services 
offered to its clients. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into, and are 
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period, if applicable. The resulting gain or loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.

Derivative contracts are short-term counterparty positions between the Group, its clients and third parties in the market. As a result there 
are derivative liabilities and derivative assets presented in the statement of financial position in respect of open positions at year end. 
All derivative positions are recognised as current assets or liabilities. 
At the end of the prior period, the Group did not hold material open positions and as such did not present a derivative balance.
£2.2 million (2016: £nil) of gains have been made, on a net basis, as a result of the fair value movements on derivatives in the period. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

2.6 Trade and other receivables
Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and classified as loans and receivables in line 
with IAS 39. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are made and recognised in the income statement when there 
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Term deposits
Term deposits comprise cash deposits held by UK licensed banks for a period of greater than three months, over which there is no recall 
during the term of the deposit. The amounts are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and classified as loans 
and receivables in line with IAS 39.
Accrued income
Accrued income relates to balances for which the Group has provided services, but balances are billed in arrears and as such are not yet 
due. The amount relates to fund management fees, interest on deposits and services direct to clients. The revenue is recognised evenly 
over the period during which services are provided, with initial recognition occurring at commencement of the agreement or period.

offset and the ability and intention to settle net. The gross amount of trade receivables is £483.4 million (2016: £718.0 million) and the 
gross amount offset in the statement of financial position with trade payables is £104.8 million (2016: £157 .2 million). Other than 
counterparty balances, trade receivables primarily consist of fees and amounts owed by clients and renewal commission owed by fund 
management groups. There are no balances where there is a legal right of offset but not a right of offset in accordance with accounting 
standards, and no collateral has been posted for the balances that have been offset.  114 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

2.7 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, 
considered to be holdings of less than three months or those over which the Group has an immediate right of recall. They are initially 
classified as loans and receivables, which means they are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of these assets is approximately equal to their fair value. 
Where the Group holds deposits on unbreakable terms greater than three months, these are classified as receivables. In the current 
year, the balance of these deposits was £180.0 million, compared to £nil in the prior year.

on behalf of clients not governed by the client money rules of £13.4 million (2016: £18.0 million). The client retains the beneficial interest in 
both these deposits and cash accounts, and accordingly, they are not included in the statement of financial position of the Group. 
2.8 Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets arise because of temporary timing differences only. The following are the major deferred tax assets recognised and 
movements thereon during the current and prior reporting years. Deferred tax has been recognised at 19% or 17%, being the rate expected

above, where we have a legal right of offset and the ability and intention to settle net, trade payable balances have been presented net. 
Other payables principally comprise amounts owed to staff as a bonus and rebates due to the regulated funds operated by the Group. 
Accruals and deferred income principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and revenue received but not yet earned on 
corporate pension schemes, where an ongoing service is still being provided.  116 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

2.10 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the end of the reporting period, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 
Provisions are recognised for:
• future committed property lease payments when the Group receives no benefit from the property through continuing usage and 
future receipts from any sub-letting arrangements are not in excess of the Group’s future committed payments.

 Notes to the Group financial statements – other
Section 5: Other notes
5.1 General information
Hargreaves Lansdown plc (the “Company”) and ultimate parent of the Group is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered 
office is One College Square South, Anchor Road, Bristol BS1 5HL, United Kingdom. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal 
activities are set out in the Operating and Financial Review. 
These financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling (£m) which is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Hargreaves Lansdown plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union (EU), and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis as discussed on page 84.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 5.2.
In the current period, the Group has adopted a new format for the financial statements. This has been done to allow users to better 
understand the primary statements and the related balances that make them up. We have also simplified our reporting of revenue and 
operating costs to ensure that the information provided is pertinent and indicates the balances of most importance, whilst ensuring 
conformity with IFRSs. In order to do this, we have aligned the notes to the financial statements with the relevant primary statements; 
where there is an associated accounting policy, it is clearly denoted by a box presented at the beginning of the note.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and subsidiary undertakings controlled by 
the Group made up to 30 June 2017 . The Group controls a subsidiary when it has power over an investee, is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
The Group reassesses whether it controls a subsidiary when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
elements of control.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquired entity. The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the 
conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the 
recognised amounts of acquired entity’s identifiable net assets. 122 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

5.1 General information (continued)
Application of new standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted and have not affected the amounts 
reported or the accounting policies in these financial statements:
• Annual improvements to IFRS 2012-2014 cycle:
 – Amendments to IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which clarifies that the reclassification of an 
asset from held for sale to held for distribution to owners is a continuation of the original plan of disposal.
 – Amendments to IFRS 7 , ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, which provides additional guidance on whether a service contract 
constitutes continuing involvement in a transferred asset.
 – Amendments to IAS 19, ‘Defined Benefit Plans’, which clarifies that the rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations 
should be determined by reference to market yields. 
• Amendment to IAS 27 , ‘Separate Financial Statements’;
• Amendments to IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
• Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Disclosure Initiative’
• Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ & IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’
• Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ & IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’
• Amendments to IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not yet been applied in 
these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
 – IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’
 – IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ – Amendments to IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
 – IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Cash-flow Statements’
 – Amendments to IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’  – Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’
 – Amendment to IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ – Amendments to IAS 28 ‘Equity Method’
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, however; it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
No early adoption of accounting standards has occurred for the years ended 30 June 2017 or 30 June 2016.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in the 
relevant notes to the financial statements.
Accounting policies as shown in the notes have been consistently applied throughout the current and prior financial year.
5.2 Key sources of judgements and estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount 
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, 
which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from actual 
circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. 
There are no assumptions made about the future, or any other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting 
period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

5.6 Related party transactions
The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, and with its Directors and members of the Executive Committee (the 
“key management personnel”). Transactions between the Company and its key management personnel are disclosed below. Details of 
transactions between the Company and other related parties are also disclosed below. 
Trading transactions
The Company entered into the following transactions with Directors within the Hargreaves Lansdown Group and related parties who are not 
members of the Group:
During the years ended 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016, the Company has been party to a lease with Peter Hargreaves, a Director until 
14 April 2015, for rental of the old head office premises at Kendal House. A ten-year lease was signed on 6 April 2011 for a rental of part of 
the building, to be used for disaster recovery purposes at a market rate rent of £0.1 million per annum. No amount was outstanding at 
either year end. 
On 12 October 2016, the Company sold 7 .5% of the ordinary share capital it held in its subsidiary undertaking Hargreaves Lansdown 
Savings Limited (HLS). The shares were sold to Stuart Louden, the Group Savings Director and currently the only other shareholder, who is 
an employee of Hargreaves Lansdown Asset Management Limited. The price paid per share was £1,000. As there is no readily available 
market for these shares the Directors had to assess a valuation based on the risks and rewards of the parties involved, given the 
uncertainty of establishing a new start up entity and its future potential. As a result HLS was valued at £1 million and the Directors of the 
Company therefore, deemed £1,000 per share to be a fair price in the circumstances. The total amount paid was £75,000 and this was 
settled immediately in cash. Following the share sale the Company now holds 92.5% of the ordinary share capital in HLS and Stuart Louden 
holds 7 .5%. The transaction was completed in order to provide incentive to Stuart Louden to successfully develop the business of HLS into 
a profitable company. In addition, the Company has granted Stuart Louden an option to purchase a further 2.5% of the ordinary share 
capital at a price of £500,000. This purchase option may be exercised at any time prior to 31 August 2021 provided that at the time of 
exercise Stuart Louden is an employee of a Hargreaves Lansdown Group company and he has not at any time given notice to terminate 
such employment. The options have no value at current beyond what was paid and as such do not appear in the Share Based Payments 
note in note 1.10.
During the years ended 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016, the Group has provided a range of investment services in the normal course 
of business to shareholders on normal third-party business terms. Directors and staff are eligible for a slight discount on some of the 
services provided.

a Group company or a member of the Executive Committee during the relevant year shown below, is set out below in aggregate for each of

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during the year (2016: £nil); there has been a reduction in Level 3 assets, of 
£0.3 million, owing to the sale of an equity investment in the period – see note 2.4 for further details.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. 
Instruments included in Level 1 comprise primarily equity investments and fund units entered into on a counter-party basis. As such there is no 
recurring valuation of financial instruments between reporting periods. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using 
valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible 
on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
127 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
The valuation techniques employed in the valuation of over-the-counter derivatives rely on market forward rates as quoted at the end of the 
period used as inputs into an appropriate pricing model.
Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments
Financial risk management
The main risks arising from financial instruments are market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk), liquidity 
risk and credit risk. Each of these risks is discussed in detail below. 
The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis. Hargreaves Lansdown’s financial risk management is based upon sound 
economic objectives and good corporate practice. No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented. The Group has 
designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management practices 
appropriate to a listed company. The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board. 
Market risk
• Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in rates associated with interest-bearing assets. 
There is an exposure to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business. At 30 June 2017 , the value of financial 
instruments on the Group Statement of Financial Position exposed to interest rate risk was £261.4 million (2016: £211.4 million) comprising 
cash, cash equivalents and term deposits. 
Impact of change in interest rates on finance income in the Consolidated Income Statement.
2017
£m
2016
£m
+50bps (0.5%) 1.0 0.5
-50bps (-0.5%) (1.0) (0.5)
This assumes the interest income has been earned evenly over the period and that rates have remained constant over the period.
This exposure is continually monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity and credit 
constraints. The Group has no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest rate or refinancing risk on borrowings. Cash at bank 
earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Term deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and 13 
months, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective fixed-term deposit rates.
Given that a source of revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate 
risk on cash balances held for clients, the balance of which was £8,243 million at 30 June 2017 (2016: £6,953 million). These amounts are not 
included in the Group statement of financial position.
• Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates. With 
substantially all of the Group’s businesses currently operating within the UK, and therefore with minimal net assets and transactions of the 
Group denominated in foreign currencies, the Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and as 
such does not hedge any foreign current assets or liabilities. The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, 
limiting foreign exchange exposure. 
• Price risk
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group as a result of an asset not 
meeting its expected value. The Group is exposed to price risk on corporate investments held on the Group statement of financial position. 
At 30 June 2017 , the fair value of investments recognised on the Group statement of financial position was £4.1 million (2016: £1.0 million). 
A 20% move in equity prices, in isolation, would have an impact of £0.8 million (2016: £0.2 million). 
As a main source of revenue is based on the value of client assets under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to price risk on 
investments held on behalf of clients. These assets are not on the Group statement of financial position. The risk of lower revenues is 
partially mitigated by asset class diversification. The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets 
arising from these risks, and so the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients.
In addition, the Group acts as a private client investment manager, unit trust manager and agency stockbroker on a matched basis so its 
exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty 
fails to fulfil its obligations. The impact of these risks is minimised by limits and monitoring controls. 128 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017

Liquidity risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due. The Group is 
highly cash generative and holds significant liquid assets. The Group actively maintains a proportion of cash balances on short-term 
deposit to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. 
The table below analyses the maturities of the undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities of the Group based on the remaining 
period to the contractual maturity date at the end of the reporting period.

Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
The Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to securities transactions during the period between the trade date and the 
ultimate settlement date if the counterparty fails either to deliver securities or to make payment. Settlement risk is substantially mitigated 
as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism whereby if a counterparty fails to make payment the securities would not be 
delivered to the counterparty. Therefore the risk exposure is to an adverse movement in market prices between the time of trade and 
settlement. Conversely, if a counterparty fails to deliver securities, no payment would be made.
The trade receivables presented in the statement of financial position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for 
impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the 
recoverability of the cash flows.
Also included within trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position are term deposits, these are deposits with UK 
licenced banks for a period of three months or greater, where the Group does not have immediate recall on the cash. The maximum amount 
of time that these deposits are outstanding at year end is 13 months.
Cash is held with UK licensed banks. The credit risk on liquid funds is minimised by only depositing with UK-regulated banks and the Group 
takes a conservative approach to treasury management, carrying out regular reviews of all its banks’ and custodians’ credit ratings. 
As at the end of the reporting period, no financial assets were individually determined to be impaired.

The following table shows the credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired using the following 
counterparty grading:
• Financial institutions
In respect of trade receivables, £96.6 million (2016: £159.3 million) is due from financial institutions regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) in the course of settlement as a result of daily trading and £2.4 million (2016: £0.4 million) relates to revenue items due from 
financial institutions regulated by the FCA. 
• Individuals

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are i) to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; ii) to maintain a strong capital base and utilise it efficiently to 
support the development of its business; and iii) to comply with the regulatory capital requirements set by the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA). Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Group’s management and Board. 
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive IV prescribed in the UK by the 
FCA. The Directive requires continual assessment of the Group’s risks in order to ensure that the higher of Pillar 1 (Minimum Capital 
Requirements) and Pillar 2 (Supervisory Review) requirements is met. 
Pillar 1 imposes a minimum capital requirement on investment firms which is calculated as the higher of the sum of the credit and market 
risk capital requirements and the fixed overheads requirement (FOR). The FOR equates to 25% of the fixed overheads reported in the most 
recent audited financial statements.
Pillar 2 requires investment firms to assess firm-specific risks not covered by the formulaic requirements of Pillar 1; the objective of this 
being to ensure that investment firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks. The Group completes its assessment of 
regulatory capital requirements using its ICAAP under Pillar 2, which is a forward looking exercise that includes stress testing on major 
risks, such as a significant market downturn, and identifying mitigating action. 
As required by the FCA, Hargreaves Lansdown holds capital based on a multiple of Pillar 1 and maintains a significant surplus over this 
requirement at all times.
The Group manages its retained earnings, share capital and share premium which total £306.0 million as at 30 June 2017 (2016: £256.5 million). 
Surplus regulatory capital was maintained throughout the year at both a consolidated Group level, as well as at an individual regulated entity 
level. Under the requirements of Pillar 3 (Disclosure), the Group is required to disclose regulatory capital information, and has done so by 
making the disclosures available in the Group’s website at www.hl.co.uk/investor-relations/pillar-3-disclosures Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
131 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
5.8 Interest in unconsolidated structured entities
The Group has determined that the investment funds it manages are structured entities. Structured entities include entities that are 
designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the relevant activities 
are directed by means of a contractual relationship. As the Group directs the investing activities of the ten Hargreaves Lansdown Multi-
Manager funds and the two Hargreaves Lansdown Select funds, through its investment management agreements with them, it considers 
them to be structured entities. The Group holds interests in these funds through the receipt of management fees, together with direct 
investments in the entities. Investments in the funds have been designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). 
The entities are entirely funded by the capital contributions associated with the purchase of units in the funds by unitholders and through 
return on investments; none of the entities have issued debt or has borrowings and none are reliant on the Group for any funding.
The Group does not sponsor any of the structured entities and there are no guarantees or commitments.
Where the Group has an equity holding in the funds, the maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees should the market 
value of the funds decrease, plus the fair value of the Group’s investment in that fund.
Structured entities with direct holdings
Direct investments in structured entities relate to box positions held by Hargreaves Lansdown Fund Managers Limited and through 
portfolios held in Hargreaves Lansdown Asset Management Limited that mimic holdings in the Portfolio Management Service and 
HL Portfolio+.
The table below shows the details of unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group has direct holdings as at 30 June 2017 and

Section 6: Company financial statements
6.11 Events after the reporting period
Events after the reporting period are shown in note 5.5 of the consolidated financial statements on page 123.
6.12 Financial risk management 
Note 5.7 to the consolidated financial statements includes the Group’s policy on capital management, its exposure to financial risks and its 
policies and processes to manage those risks. There are financial instruments in the Company made up of amounts receivable from 
subsidiaries and the Employee Benefit Trust and amounts payable to subsidiaries. The nature and extent of risks arising from these 
financial instruments are as follows:
(a) Liquidity risk
The Company is exposed to liquidity risk, namely the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due. The 
payment obligations primarily relate to amounts payable to subsidiaries which are more than offset by the amounts owed from 
subsidiaries. In addition, the Company holds significant cash balances on short-term deposit to ensure that it has sufficient available funds 
to meet its obligations and fund its operations.
At the end of the reporting period, none of the liabilities of the Company are past due or represent a significant long-term liability.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to perform its financial obligations, resulting in financial loss; however, the amounts owed to 
the Company are primarily from its own subsidiaries. Given the profitability and net assets of the majority of subsidiaries, credit risk is felt 
to be minimal.
As per the wider Group, cash is held with UK licensed banks. The credit risk on liquid funds is minimised because the counterparties are 
banks with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The Group takes a conservative approach to treasury 
management and selection of banking counterparties, and carries out regular reviews of all its banks’ and custodians’ credit ratings.
As at the end of the reporting period, no financial assets were individually determined to be impaired. The balance of assets past due 
is immaterial.
The following table discloses the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets.

1 Following the implementation of the Retail Distribution Review in March 2014, the gross reported revenue was boosted by a new revenue stream and at the same time loyalty 
bonuses paid to Vantage clients were significantly increased. In order to better compare revenue performance across the five years above, net revenue which is total revenue 
less the commission payable and loyalty bonus has been shown. 
Five year summary 144 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
Within the report and financial statements various alternative financial performance measures are referred to, which are non-GAAP 
(Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) measures. They are used in order to provide a better understanding of the performance of the 
Group and the table below states those which have been used, how they have been calculated and why they have been used.
Measure Calculation Why we use this measure
Dividend pay-out ratio (%) The total dividend per share divided by the basic 
earnings per share (EPS) for a financial year.
Provides a measure of the level of profits paid out to 
shareholders and the level retained in the business.
Dividend per share  
(pence per share)
Total dividend payable relating to a financial year 
divided by the total number of shares eligible to 
receive a dividend. Note ordinary shares held in the 
Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust have 
agreed to waive all dividends.
Dividend per share is pertinent information to 
shareholders and investors and provides them with 
the ability to assess the dividend yield of the 
Hargreaves Lansdown plc shares.
Operating costs The costs as per the income statement excluding 
commission payable (i.e. the aggregate of staff 
costs, other operating costs and FSCS costs).
In light of the transitional period relating to the Retail 
Distribution Review (see net revenue below) and the 
impact this had on commission payable in the form of 
loyalty bonuses, this measure of operating costs 
provides a more useful comparative measure over 
time.
Operating profit margin Profits after deducting operating costs but before 
the impact of finance income and other gains or 
losses divided by revenue.
Provides a measure of profitability of the core 
operating activities and excludes non-core items.
Net revenue (£)
(See consolidated income 
Statement on page 98 for the 
reconciliation of net revenue)
Total revenue less commission payments which are 
primarily loyalty bonuses paid to Vantage clients.
Because of the changes brought about to the client 
charging structure by the Retail Distribution Review 
(“RDR”) there was a transitional period (from 1 March 
2014 to 1 April 2016). From 1 March 2014, revenue 
was increased as Hargreaves Lansdown earned both 
a new platform fee from clients and the existing 
renewal commission from the fund management 
groups based on the value of funds held by clients. 
At the same time the loyalty bonus paid to clients 
was significantly increased on the pre-RDR funds to 
largely mitigate the impact of the new platform fee. 
In order to aid comparability during the period of 
transition to 1 April 2016 the net revenue measure 
became the most useful comparative measure of 
revenue as it better reflected the underlying income 
relating to funds held by clients.
Net recurring revenue The total value of renewal commission (after 
deducting loyalty bonuses), platform fees, 
management fees and interest earned on 
client money.
Provides a measure of the quality of our earnings. 
We believe recurring revenue provides greater profit 
resilience and hence is of higher quality than 
non-recurring revenue.
Percentage of recurring net 
revenue (%)
The total value of renewal commission (after 
deducting loyalty bonuses), platform fees, 
management fees and interest earned on client 
money divided by the total net revenue.
Provides a measure of the quality of our earnings. 
We believe recurring revenue provides greater profit 
resilience and hence is of higher quality than 
non-recurring revenue.

Measure Calculation Why we use this measure
Net revenue margin (bps) Total net revenue divided by the average value of 
assets under administration which includes the 
Portfolio Management Services assets under 
management held in funds on which a platform fee 
is charged.
Provides the most comparable means of tracking, 
over time, the margin earned on the assets under 
administration and is used by management to assess 
business performance.
Net revenue margin from cash 
(bps)
Net revenue from cash (net interest earned on the 
value of client money held on the platform divided 
by the average value of assets under 
administration held as client money).
Provides a means of tracking, over time, the margin 
earned on cash held by our clients.
Net revenue margin from 
funds (bps)
Net revenue derived from funds held by clients 
(platform fees, initial commission less loyalty 
bonus) divided by the average value of assets 
under administration held as funds, which includes 
the Portfolio Management Services assets under 
management held in funds on which a platform fee 
is charged.
Provides the most comparable means of tracking, 
over time, the margin earned on funds held by 
our clients.
Net revenue margin from HL 
Funds
Management fees derived from HL Funds (but 
excluding the platform fee) divided by the average 
value of assets held in the HL Funds.
Provides a means of tracking, over time, the margin 
earned on HL Funds.
Net revenue margin from 
shares (bps)
Net revenue from shares (stockbroking 
commissions, management fees where shares are 
held in a SIPP or ISA, less the cost of dealing errors) 
divided by the average value of assets under 
administration held as shares.
Provides a means of tracking, over time, the margin 
earned on shares held by our clients.
Recurring revenue Revenue  that is received every month depending 
on the value of assets held on the platform, 
including platform fee, management fees and 
interest earned on client money.
We believe recurring revenue provides greater profit 
resilience and hence is of higher quality than 
non-recurring revenue.
Transactional revenue Revenue that is non-recurring in nature and 
dependent on a client instruction such as a deal to 
buy or sell shares or take advice.
Such revenue is not as high quality as recurring 
revenue but helps to show the diversification of our 
revenue streams. 146 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017
