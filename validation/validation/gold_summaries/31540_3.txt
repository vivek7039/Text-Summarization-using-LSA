Chairman’s statement
Overview
Last year saw the 30th anniversary of the start-up of Synectics. 
This landmark provided the occasion not only to celebrate the 
achievements of all those who have helped to build Synectics 
into a successful technology business, from the founders to our 
current apprentices, but also to reflect on what has changed 
and what endures.
I am pleased to say that during my engagement across the 
various parts of the business in 2017 I found a high degree of 
alignment around the enduring purpose and values of Synectics; 
I won’t repeat these, since they are set out in detail elsewhere, 
suffice it to say here that the core elements are, and have been 
for 30 years, value to customers and innovation. I believe these 
will remain the foundation for a sustainable and prosperous 
future for the Company.
During the 2016/17 financial year the Group’s results continued to 
reflect the impact of the 2015 collapse in global oil & gas prices on 
one of our largest customer sectors. Management has taken action 
to maintain profitability in that area by reducing costs, and delivered a 
very creditable increase in operating margin in our oil & gas activities 
last year. The Board remains convinced that the right course is to 
preserve the critical capability that underlies our leading market 
position in the sector, and indeed to focus on positioning the business 
to gain market share once the recovery is underway. We believe the 
right balance has been struck in the interests of long-term value.
Other underlying factors that influenced our results include a 
global gaming market that remained buoyant, increased demand 
from infrastructure customers, such as utilities, data centres and 
transport hubs, and a sharp decline in new bus deliveries in the UK.
Against that background, the Board is pleased with the performance 
of the Company for 2016/17, which was in line with our expectations.
We expect the trend of growing profitability of our business 
operations to continue in the current financial year. In addition, 
opportunities have been identified for innovative development 
of our core product set, using emerging technology applications 
being introduced in other fields to expand Synectics’ offerings 
to its current markets. Consistent with our growth strategy, 
the Board has authorised a significant increase in research 
& development expense to capitalise on those opportunities. 
The increased expense for this investment means that the 
Board’s current expectations are for reported profits in 2017/18 
to be broadly flat compared to last year. Further detail is set 
out in the Outlook section below.
Results
For the year to 30 November 2017, Synectics’ consolidated 
revenue was £70.1 million (2016: £70.9 million). This reflected 
a reduction in gaming sector revenue following the exceptionally 
high level achieved in 2016, lower than expected revenues in 
UK transport, offset with progress in infrastructure projects 
and integrated systems.
An improvement in operating margins across both of the Group’s 
divisions led to a 15% increase in underlying profit before tax
1
 to 
£3.0 million (2016: £2.6 million). There were no material non-underlying 
costs in the year, so statutory profit before tax was also £3.0 million 
(2016: £2.0 million). Underlying diluted earnings per share were 15.2p 
(2016: 12.4p) and diluted earnings per share were 15.1p (2016: 8.8p). 
On a constant currency basis
2
, these results benefited directly by 
around £0.2 million from the impact of the depreciation of sterling 
across the year on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. However, 
this translation benefit was partially offset by corresponding increases 
in the sterling costs of US dollar-denominated components used 
in our systems sold in the UK.
The Group’s balance sheet continued to strengthen, with net 
cash at 30 November 2017 of £3.8 million (2016: £2.2 million). 
The consolidated firm order book at year end was £24.4 million 
(2016: £26.2 million).
Dividend
The Board is recommending payment of an increased final 
dividend of 3.0p per share (2016: 2.0p), payable on 4 May 2018 
to shareholders registered on 3 April 2018, for approval by 
shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 26 April 2018.
For 30 years, the core elements of Synectics’ 
purpose and values have been value to customers 
and innovation. I believe these will remain the 
foundation for a sustainable and prosperous 
future for the Company.”

Introduction
People
I would like once again to pass on the Board’s sincere thanks to 
Synectics’ employees at all levels. This is an organisation with a culture 
of high expectations for commitment and performance, especially in 
delivering on our promises to customers. As such, the pressures on 
employees are often considerable and are consistently borne with 
fortitude and good humour. We recognise and are deeply grateful 
for their continuing contributions to the business.
Our annual employee opinion survey last summer demonstrated 
high and upward-trending results across most areas of the business. 
This reflected substantial efforts by management to increase 
communication and engagement throughout the Group. This 
effort, which is strongly supported by the Board, will continue. 
Strategy
Synectics’ strategy remains to create leadership positions within 
specialised sectors of the electronic security and surveillance industry, 
through the combination of expert, sector-specific market knowledge 
and, where appropriate, our own proprietary technologies. These 
proprietary technologies are based on open systems and built around 
Synectics’ core command and control integration software; they 
are developed specifically for our chosen specialist market sectors 
and provide fundamental differentiation from the offerings of 
mainstream suppliers in the wider electronic security market.
As the volume of digital data generated by high-end, video-centric 
security systems continues to grow exponentially, the complexity 
of extracting meaningful and actionable intelligence from that data is 
opening up many opportunities for innovation. Throughout its 30-year 
history, Synectics has consistently demonstrated the combination 
of deep technical capability and practical, expertise-based sales 
approach needed to benefit from such opportunities. This is 
essentially an entrepreneurial skill.
A core element of our strategy is to ensure that the business 
keeps building the culture and processes necessary to maintain 
that entrepreneurial essence at larger scale as we continue to grow.
Outlook
The 2018 financial year has begun in line with the Board’s expectations. 
The year will be marked by a number of positive and short-term 
negative countercurrents in our largest market sectors, and also 
by clear opportunities to invest organically in solidifying Synectics’ 
position as a market leader in specialist high-end surveillance. 
The Integration & Managed Services division continues to perform 
well, and we expect further growth in profits this year.
Within the larger Systems division, Synectics’ revenue and profit 
trends over the remainder of this year are likely to be different in 
our three major end-user segments:
• The gaming sector, which has performed exceptionally well in the 
last two years and where Synectics continues to gain market share, 
will see a respite in major new resort developments coming on 
stream in the Far East and a likely slowdown in surveillance upgrade 
programmes in the United States. Despite entering the current 
financial year with an order book and qualified pipeline of new 
business 50% higher than at the same time last year, we anticipate 
at this stage that the profit contribution from the sector in 2017/18, 
although still strong, is likely to be lower than last year’s.
• The global oil & gas surveillance sector should continue to 
generate a stable positive contribution to profits in the current 
year. There is evidence of a recent pick-up in market activity, 
and Synectics is well placed to benefit as soon as new projects 
come on line. However, the normal gestation period of upstream 
oil & gas projects means that the upturn in our revenues in that 
sector should not be expected before 2019.
• Following further investment in sales resources, revenues from 
the transport & infrastructure sector, outside the UK bus market, 
are expected to grow at an increased rate in 2017/18. 
Finally, after close evaluation the Board has authorised an increase 
of approximately £500,000 in this year’s research & development 
expense to accelerate Synectics’ development of our core software 
product base. We see an opportunity to provide sophisticated 
end users with real improvements in the capability, breadth and 
cost-effectiveness of their security systems. With its established 
customer base and trusted reputation for successful technical 
innovation, Synectics is ideally positioned to benefit from the 
increasing pace of developments in the wider information technology 
sphere, which we believe can now be profitably applied to our markets. 
Although this increased research & development is in one sense 
discretionary expenditure, the Board’s judgement is that the long-term 
interests of the Company will best be served by ensuring that we 
invest sufficient resources now to capitalise fully on the capabilities 
and market positions that Synectics has successfully established 
and built over recent years. 
Taken together, the above factors lead the Board to conclude that 
the Group’s consolidated underlying profit before tax in our 2018 
financial year is most likely to be broadly flat compared to last year, 
as the impact of growth in underlying current business is offset by 
increased investment in strengthening our position for the future.
We believe that Synectics continues to make good progress 
towards its objectives. The improvements made to management 
and operational structures over the past couple of years are working 
well, the Group is starting to behave much more like a single focussed 
business, and there is an apparent growing sense of confidence in 
most parts of our operations. The Board has recently reviewed the 
Group’s latest medium-term plans. It remains our belief that, given 
normal economic conditions, Synectics is capable within its current 
business base of achieving its targets of significant revenue growth 
from current levels, and an operating profit margin of 8–10%.
