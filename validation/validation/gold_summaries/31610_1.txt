 Delivering against clear strategic priorities
CEO Review
Overview
In spite of challenging market conditions 
DMGT has delivered a resilient 
performance in a year of transformation 
at the Company. 
During the reporting period, we strengthened 
our balance sheet by reducing our holding 
in Euromoney; we agreed to divest assets; 
and we delivered cost savings through 
operational efficiency.
At the operating level, dmg media 
outperformed in its markets and many 
of our B2B companies delivered a robust 
performance, with the exception of Genscape 
and Xceligent. As a long-term investor, 
we continued to invest through the cycle, 
particularly at RMS, which successfully 
launched Risk Modeler on RMS(one), and 
dmg information. The Consumer Media 
business delivered good underlying profit 
growth, reflecting the progress made at 
MailOnline, which moved into operating 
profit during the final quarter. Adjusted 
operating and pre-tax profits declined 
year-on-year, mainly due to the reduced 
stake in Euromoney. 
The challenging conditions in many of our 
markets served as a further reminder of the 
need to transform our business. This work 
has begun as part of our Company-wide 
Performance Improvement Programme, 
which we are rolling out to better position 
us for consistent long-term growth.
Already, we have made good progress on 
the strategic priorities laid out at the start 
of the year: improving operational execution, 
increasing portfolio focus and enhancing 
financial flexibility. 
We have delayered management, reduced 
overheads, enhanced our talent and 
refocused each business’s priorities. We have 
sharpened our focus on our strongest brands 
and our financial flexibility has improved 
with net debt to EBITDA now at 1.4 times, 
the lowest level in over 20 years. 
I am confident that our programme of action 
will deliver long-term sustainable growth 
and shareholder returns.
We are building on strong foundations, as 
shown by aspects of our performance in the 
past financial year. For the year covered by 
this report, operational highlights include 
the sustained strong revenue growth and 
transition to profitability of MailOnline 
following a multi-year investment strategy; 
the successful delivery of RMS(one) in the 
Insurance Risk sector; and the restructuring 
and refocusing of our EdTech business, 
Hobsons, into a more growth oriented 
model focused on student success. 
Another focus area has been to strengthen 
our management team, both at the centre 
and throughout the businesses, ensuring we 
have the right talent to improve performance 
and position DMGT for the future. 
We managed our portfolio more actively, 
initially with the reduction in our stake in 
Euromoney and subsequently with the sale 
of Elite Daily in Consumer Media and the 
Admissions business within the EdTech 
sector. This, coupled with a renewed focus 
on cash generation, has lowered our debt, 
strengthened our leverage ratios, and 
ultimately given us the financial flexibility 
to take advantage of opportunities as 
they arise. 
The carrying values of Genscape, the Energy 
Information business, and two early-stage 
US Property Information businesses, 
Xceligent and SiteCompli, were impaired. 
This decision reflected a more cautious 
outlook for each of these businesses.
At Genscape, which faced challenging market 
conditions during the year with low levels of 
price volatility, a sustained low oil price and 
changes to solar energy distribution channels 
in the US, the carrying value of the business 
has been reduced to £141 million, resulting 
in an impairment charge of £140 million.
Expansion into the national market has been 
slower than previously expected at Xceligent 
and SiteCompli, notably Xceligent’s revenue 
growth in New York, which it launched into 
during the year. Given the further investment 
required in Xceligent and the long path to 
cash generation, the prudent decision has 
been taken to incur a full impairment charge 
of £65 million in respect of both businesses. 
I am confident, however, that DMGT is on 
track to becoming a higher performance 
business with a strong balance sheet to 
deliver on our long-term potential. We are 
laying the groundwork to position the 
Group for further success. Above all, 
our commitment remains to deliver 
on DMGT’s full potential.
Financial Performance 
Group revenues grew by 1% on an underlying 
basis, reflecting good growth from our digital 
consumer business, MailOnline, and modest 
progress elsewhere in the Group. Operating 
profit declined by an underlying 2%, 
primarily due to our investments in the 
B2B businesses and amortisation costs at 
RMS. There was encouraging underlying 
profit growth at dmg media, driven by 
good cost control and increasing MailOnline 
profitability. This was offset by profit 
declines at dmg information and RMS. 
The performance of dmg information 
was adversely affected by the challenges 
at Genscape and Xceligent.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Paul Zwillenberg
CEO
In FY 2017 , we started to deliver on the clear 
strategic priorities laid out at the start of the 
year; improving operational execution, 
increasing portfolio focus and enhancing 
financial flexibility .
Statutory operating profit and profit 
before tax were adversely affected by the 
impairments at dmg information but statutory 
earnings per share increased 69% due to 
the gain on the Euromoney transaction. 
Year end net debt of £464 million was 
£214 million lower than in FY 2016, reflecting 
the net operating cash inflow and disposal 
proceeds. The net debt to EBITDA ratio 
of 1.4 times was comfortably below the 
Group’s preferred upper limit of 2.0 times.
The strengthening of the balance sheet was 
an important achievement during the year. 
In the Financial Review (pages 25 to 31), 
Tim Collier, Group Chief Financial Officer, 
describes our financial performance in 
further detail. Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) are used to measure DMGT’s 
performance at a Group level and there is 
an update on how these have progressed 
during the reporting period on pages 14 
and 15 of the Strategic Report.
2017 Strategic Priorities
In December 2016, I outlined three strategic 
priorities that will help position DMGT for 
the future. While there is much more to do, 
we have made good, clear progress 
with the launch of our Performance 
Improvement Programme.
Improving operational execution
The first priority of improving operational 
execution included enhancing our 
performance management system and 
eliminating red tape to ensure that we are 
faster, fitter and more agile. These areas 
will help us deliver on our investments, 
ultimately driving value creation across 
the Group.
As a part of this, we remodelled and 
strengthened our central management team, 
drawing heavily on existing DMGT talent.
Key internal promotions included a 
Group Head of Strategy & Performance 
Management, Group HR Director, Group 
Chief Information Officer, and Group Head of 
M&A, alongside the external appointment of 
a new Group CFO. Among our businesses, we 
also made a number of senior appointments 
including new Presidents, CEOs and Chief 
Operating Officers, supplementing internal 
talent with external hires to broaden the 
industry expertise within the Group.
We have reduced the complexity of the 
management structure in the B2B portfolio, 
bringing the individual operating companies 
closer to the central management team. 
Above all, our aim has been to give each 
company the resources they require to fulfil 
their strategic ambitions, whilst supporting 
the extraordinary entrepreneurial spirit and 
talent that drives our success. In addition, 
we have increased our focus on nurturing 
and developing rising talent as well as 
bolstering skills critical for our future such 
as technology, customer solutions and 
data science capabilities.
From a business perspective, the operational 
improvements have driven significant 
progress in three particular areas. 
Firstly, RMS executed the successful launch 
and rollout of the Risk Modeler application 
on RMS(one), the new platform for digitising 
risk for the insurance industry. RMS also 
delivered RiskLink17 and an unprecedented 
array of modelling solutions, with major 
updates to its core models and the release 
of several entirely new models. With the 
gradual client migration to RMS(one) and 
continued strong model development, RMS 
is poised to deliver good long-term growth 
and returns in support of the Insurance Risk 
sector’s digital transformation.
FY 2017 saw  
a major focus on 
strengthening our 
management teams, 
enhancing our 
performance 
management system 
and eliminating red 
tape to ensure that 
we are faster and 
more agile.”
Reported results were impacted by the 
reduction in our stake of Euromoney to 
c.49% in December 2016, whereupon 
it became an associate for the final nine 
months of the financial year. Pro forma 
reported revenue, adjusting for the 
Euromoney transaction, increased by 3%, 
reflecting the benefit of the stronger US 
dollar versus the British pound. The Group’s 
pro forma operating profit was up 2%, 
with an operating profit margin of 12%.
Group adjusted profit before tax and 
earnings per share were down 13% and 1% 
respectively, although up by 4% and 7% on 
a pro forma basis, and the recommended 
dividend per share was up 3%.
The Board remains committed to delivering 
dividend growth in excess of inflation, 
consistent with our dividend policy.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Secondly, we have been encouraged by 
continued strong growth from MailOnline, 
where revenues reached £119 million, 
up an underlying 20%. The performance 
was driven by its growing global audience, 
content and distribution partnerships with 
global platforms Google, Facebook and 
Snapchat, and strong performance in 
programmatic advertising in the US and 
UK. The increased scale of the business, 
combined with a deep focus on operational 
efficiencies, resulted in MailOnline moving 
into operating profit during the final quarter 
of the financial year.
Finally, in the EdTech sector, Hobsons 
made good progress on strengthening 
its high growth Student Success solutions 
for US High School and College students 
following a refocusing and restructuring 
of the business. In particular, the 
modernisation of the Naviance platform to 
improve customer experience is progressing 
well and will continue to be a core focus of 
Hobsons’ activity this coming year. Looking 
forward, we are optimistic about the future 
growth prospects for its Naviance, Intersect 
and Starfish products.
Increasing portfolio focus
By increasing our portfolio focus, DMGT is 
seeing the benefits of a more streamlined 
structure. In FY 2017 we began a major 
strategic review, working through every 
business in the portfolio to understand 
its potential growth and returns and the 
resources required to achieve this.
The first significant step in delivering 
increased portfolio focus was the reduction 
in our stake in Euromoney in December 2016 
to c.49%. This was followed by the disposal 
of Elite Daily and closure of 7 Days in the 
Consumer Media sector. Within EdTech, 
we split the Hobsons business into the faster 
growing Student Success and the more 
mature Admissions and Solutions businesses 
to enable a distinct approach to managing 
the two parts. Both the Admissions and 
Solutions businesses were disposed of, in 
September and October 2017 respectively. 
The disposal of EDR, the US Property 
Information business, is currently underway 
and will further sharpen DMGT’s focus.
Delivering against clear strategic priorities
CEO Review
A clear strategy and bold vision for the future
We have defined a new strategic vision for DMGT entitled 
‘Intelligent Insights. Consumer Connections’. Due to the Group’s 
strengths and capabilities across B2B and Consumer Media, 
DMGT has a competitive advantage from two important 
converging trends across these sectors. Firstly, in B2B sectors, 
customers increasingly expect to have the same quality of user 
interface as they do with consumer products. Secondly, the 
most successful consumer products are built on robust use of 
data and analytics to gain insight. The agility, speed to market, 
user engagement and audience understanding demonstrated 
by MailOnline can be applied within our B2B businesses. The 
advanced analytics and resilient and secure technology required 
in our B2B sectors can be applied to Consumer Media digital 
businesses. DMGT’s strategy will be focused on seeking 
opportunities, either through organic initiatives or acquisition, 
which can exploit the converging trends across the B2B and 
Consumer Media sectors.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Enhancing financial flexibility
Through our improved operational execution 
and increased portfolio focus, we have 
achieved a stronger balance sheet. At the 
year end, net debt was £464 million with 
a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times, the 
lowest it has been in over 20 years, as a 
result of disposal proceeds and continuing 
healthy cash generation. We now have more 
flexibility to invest behind our businesses, 
both organically and via acquisition, to 
support long-term growth and value creation.
In pursuing a balanced capital allocation 
approach, we remain committed to 
increasing shareholder returns through 
sustainable real dividend growth.
Strategy update
A new strategic vision has been defined 
based on the convergence of trends within 
B2B and Consumer Media and the strong 
position that DMGT is in given the breadth 
of expertise across the Group.
We have begun to execute on the 
Performance Improvement Programme, 
which will deliver results against our three 
key strategic priorities. Building on the solid 
foundations established through recent 
operational initiatives, DMGT’s performance 
and execution will be improved through 
upgrading businesses’ technology, sales 
force effectiveness and pricing capabilities. 
The increasing focus of the portfolio will 
be driven by the Group’s strengths, 
notably where the convergence of B2B and 
Consumer Media gives DMGT a competitive 
advantage. DMGT will also ensure it has the 
financial flexibility to pursue opportunities 
as they arise, notably to build scale in those 
sectors that can deliver focused growth.
Outlook
We have started the new financial year 
with our businesses performing in line 
with our expectations. FY 2018 will be an 
important year of transition for DMGT as we 
continue to lay the necessary groundwork 
for the future. 
The markets in which we operate continue 
to be disrupted by new technologies, volatile 
demand and changing consumption habits 
among the audiences we serve.
In B2B, the financial performance will 
be adversely affected by disposals. 
Despite challenging market conditions, we 
nevertheless expect B2B to deliver modest 
underlying revenue growth, reflecting 
the benefits of increased focus. On the 
Consumer Media side, digital revenues are 
expected to grow further, helping to offset 
anticipated circulation volume and print 
advertising declines, with advertising  
market conditions likely to remain volatile. 
The Consumer Media operating profit is 
expected to reflect lower overall revenues, 
continued cost efficiencies within the 
newspapers and MailOnline being profitable.
The Board remains confident that DMGT 
has good long-term prospects, supported 
by a more flexible balance sheet and by the 
entrepreneurialism, purpose and passion 
that are so distinctive in the Group. 
I am confident that the Performance 
Improvement Programme will generate 
long-term sustainable growth. And it will 
help us to navigate near term challenging 
trading conditions. This will, in turn, enable 
us to maintain our progressive dividend 
policy, with a commitment to growing 
shareholder returns.
We look forward to delivering on  
DMGT’s potential.
