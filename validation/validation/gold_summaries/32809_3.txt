TRANSFORMING 
OUR BUSINESS
Chairman’s Report
I am delighted to present the Annual Financial 
Statements of Bushveld Minerals for the year ended 
28 February 2017 . I am particularly pleased to be 
doing this at a transformational point in the 
Company’s development, as we transition from  
a junior exploration company to a producing 
company. Though commodity markets have 
markedly recovered since the lows of 2015/16, 
capital markets remain challenging particularly for 
junior miners for whom access to capital continues 
to be largely constrained. 
We articulated a commodity-focused platform 
strategy in 2014 based on which we would develop 
each of the Company’s three platforms, comprising 
Bushveld Vanadium, Greenhills Resources and 
Lemur Resources, with a view to building each on  
a path to independent existence with dedicated 
resources. At the same time we outlined our 
intention to prioritise vanadium as the flagship of 
the Company. Finally, we outlined four key pillars 
guiding the development of our projects, being (a) 
choosing commodities with a positive market 
outlook; (b) developing assets with a low cost curve 
positioning; (c) executing a clear realisable path to 
production and, thus, cash flows and finally (d) 
ensuring scalability. 
I am pleased to report that the Company has been 
disciplined and consistent in delivering on this 
strategy. Each of the three platforms has made 
strides in realising its objectives. At Lemur 
Resources, the efforts to secure an Independent 
Power Producer licence for the project continue 
apace and we hope that the licence will be agreed 
shortly. I am encouraged to see the prominence  
and attention given to the Lemur Power Project  
by the government, including the Presidency of 
Madagascar at the recent Madagascar Investment 
Conference hosted by the South African Government 
in Pretoria during mid-June 2017 . The power project 
will provide a captive market for the Imaloto Coal 
Project and see the planned project capital 
investment grow from an initial estimate of  
US$16m to over US$200m. 
Meanwhile, the acquisition of a 49.5% interest in the 
Uis Tin Project provides Greenhills with the critical 
mass necessary for a stand-alone tin platform. The 
“ We articulated a commodity-focussed platform

fact that the Uis Tin Project comes with a mining 
licence and a pilot plant that can be refurbished is  
an additional benefit that allows the project path  
to production to be accelerated. Efforts to list the 
Greenhills Resources platform separately are now 
well underway and expected to be completed during 
the next financial year.
It is in the flagship vanadium platform, however,  
that the most progress has been made. Most 
notable is the completion of the acquisition on 
6 April 2017, by Bushveld Vametco Limited (BVL), 
co-owned 45:55 with Yellow Dragon Holdings 
Limited, of the primary vanadium mining and 
processing company, Vametco Alloys (Proprietary) 
Limited. The Company also completed the 
acquisition of the Brits Vanadium Project, the 
development project which potentially hosts a 
significant strike extension of the current Vametco 
mine ore body. The acquisition of Vametco could  
not have been completed at a better time, with 
vanadium prices on a solid upward trajectory. 
Vametco is a quality low-cost producer with a  
sound financial position that has allowed us to use  
a significant amount of debt funding for the 
acquisition. That BVL has been able to pay back all 
the external debt and facilitate a BEE transaction for 
Vametco within three months of the completion of 
the transaction is testament to the strong balance 
sheet and cash-generation capacity of this important 
asset. In acquiring Vametco, BVL has not only 
acquired a quality operating mine and processing 
facility, but a management team with extensive 
experience in the vanadium industry combining 
more than 100 years of industry experience. In 
addition, the management team has worked on 
every one of the primary vanadium-processing 
plants in South Africa.
This intellectual capital will be important as we look 
to grow the combined Bushveld vanadium platform 
from its current 3.5% market share of the global 
vanadium supply to a share projected at more than 
10% in the next three to five years. 
I am also pleased to note the significant progress 
made by Bushveld Energy in establishing the market 
opportunity for vanadium redox flow batteries in 
Africa. Bushveld Energy has established an 
invaluable working relationship with its local partner, 
the Industrial Development Corporation of South 
Africa. Through delivery on our agreed objectives, 
we are on plan to vindicate the IDC’s choice of 
large-scale energy storage as one of the significant 
new industries to support in South Africa. I look 
forward to seeing continued progress on what has 
been achieved to date over the course of the 
coming year.
All this progress is praiseworthy. It happens, 
however, amidst a time of significant uncertainty  
in the global political and economic sphere. The UK 
Brexit vote, US elections and elections in France 
where there was much at stake in terms of the 
future direction of these important economies, all 
contributed to an environment of general political 
and economic uncertainty. In South Africa, 2017 is 
an important year for the African National Congress 
(the country’s ruling political party), which holds its 
congress to elect a new national leader at the end  
of the year. The significance of this lies in the nature 
of South Africa’s constitutional democracy, with the 
party that wins the elections effectively appointing  
the president of the country. We watch this election 
process, one of the most contested in recent years, 
with much interest.
The South African government recently attempted 
to gazette a new Mining Charter, placing greater 
obligations on mining companies. It proposes 
greater representation of historically disadvantaged 
persons in procurement opportunities, shareholding, 
management and the board composition of mining 
companies. The Mining Charter has, however, since 
been suspended pending an outcome of legal 
challenges brought by the South African Chamber  
of Mines. 
An important antidote to this uncertainty, however, 
has to be a sound and functional democratic system 
within which the politics play out. This presents a 
source of confidence in the long-term investment 
case of South African based projects. South Africa 
enjoys a constitutional democratic order that is 
sound and effective and is underpinned by an 
effective independent judiciary and chapter  
9 institutions such as the Public Protector. 
Geology plays a significant part in primary vanadium 
producers’ resource bases. South Africa has the 
largest and best quality primary vanadium resource 
base of any nation. As a consequence Bushveld 
Minerals is well positioned as it develops its 
integrated vanadium platform. Moreover, with over 
90% of its costs being Rand denominated and more 
than 95% of its forecast revenues being foreign-
currency denominated, Bushveld has a natural 
hedge against any potential deterioration of local 
economic conditions, in addition to its already low 
cost curve positioning. 
As the Company continues in its quest to become  
a significant vanadium producer and undertakes the 
listing of Greenhills Resources, it will see the already 
lean management team stretched across the two 
distinct platforms, imposing the need for more 
human capital. Accordingly in the coming year we 
will bolster the management team and the Board to 
ensure that the Company has the requisite capacity 
for the journey ahead, a journey I am delighted to be 
a part of.
I would like to thank our management team for their 
considerable efforts in what has been a challenging 
but exciting time for our Company. The business is 
dependent upon the hard work, dedication and skills 
of all our team. I would in particular like to thank our 
CEO Fortune Mojapelo, who has led the team in an 
exemplary way. Also, to my colleagues on the board, 
I extend my appreciation for their wise council and 
advice that I have received this year.
