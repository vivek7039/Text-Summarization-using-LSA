 Chairman’s introduction
Dear shareholders
I am pleased to present our corporate 
governance report for 2017.
Following the down-cycle challenges 
of 2015–16, the past year has been 
one of consolidation and renewal.
Our wide-ranging portfolio of assets 
together with our leading marketing 
business are unique in the industry. 
Even at the low point in the most 
recent downturn, the Group’s 
annualised Adjusted EBITDA  
was circa $8 billion (H2 2015 and  
H1 2016), supported by the generally 
more stable Marketing earnings. 
Shareholders will of course note the 
comparative figure of $14.8 billion for 
2017, reflecting both stronger pricing 
across the industrial portfolio and  
our strongest performance from 
Marketing since 2008. 
During the last year we have grown 
the business through delivery of 
major brownfield capital projects and 
corporate transactions on both the 
buy-side and sell-side, including:
• considerable progress in the 
Katanga (copper/cobalt),  
Mopani (copper) and Koniambo 
(nickel) projects
• BaseCore Metals streams and 
royalties joint venture with  
Ontario Teachers 
• agreed the formation of a joint 
venture with Yancoal for the  
Hunter Valley Coal Operations 
• acquisition of the majority  
of voting shares in Peruvian zinc 
miner Volcan 
• contribution of a portfolio of 
petroleum storage and logistics 
assets to an arrangement  
with HNA
Safety remains a top priority for  
the Board. We are committed to 
achieving our goal of zero fatalities. 
We offer our condolences to the 
families of the nine people who  
lost their lives while working at our 
operations last year. The HSEC 
Committee has met with the 
management of all the operations 
where the fatalities occurred to 
review the incidents and ensure  
that appropriate actions are taken  
to prevent recurrence.
Our numerous and wide-ranging 
asset base provides unique 
challenges. However, during every 
year in which I have served on your 
Board, I have seen considerable 
efforts to tackle legacy issues from 
some previous underinvestment and 
a continuous and significant record 
of improvement.
We continue to invest in our 
considerable and committed 
workforce and will seek over  
time to widen our reporting on 
people matters.
While the business has performed well, we are  
constantly reminded of the importance of governance, 
compliance and sustainability issues. We have refreshed 
and strengthened the Board with the appointments  
of Martin Gilbert and Gill Marcus

Glencore Annual Report 2017 While the business has performed 
well, we are constantly reminded  
of the importance of governance, 
compliance and sustainability issues, 
not least by some adverse media  
and NGO reports.
The Board has overseen the 
Company’s response to Katanga’s 
accounting restatement. This has 
been an important area of focus for 
us in the past few months, as detailed 
further on pages 92 and 97.
We continue to refresh the Board. 
Over the past twelve months we have 
been pleased to welcome two new 
Directors. Gill Marcus has led an 
exemplary career of public service  
to South Africa, which culminated in 
her five year tenure as head of the 
Reserve Bank of South Africa. Martin 
Gilbert is one of Europe’s leading 
asset management entrepreneurs 
and is now co-CEO of Standard Life 
Aberdeen plc. Further details of their 
experience is on page 82.
Also during the year, Bill Macaulay 
stepped down from the Board. 
He had been a Director since the 
Company’s IPO in May 201 1 and  
has been a strong and consistent 
contributor to board debate and  
I would like to thank him again for  
his valuable contribution to Glencore.
In tax, we have seen, previously 
through the EITI standards and 
latterly through the EU Directive  
on mandatory reporting for listed 
companies on payments to 
governments, a welcome move to 
transparency with regard to the tax 
position of corporates in the resources 
sector. Our relevant disclosures are 
referred to on page 106. As the 
OECD’s base erosion and profit 
shifting project moves into the 
implementation stage, we are now 
complying with the reporting 
requests of member countries.
Following the endorsement of the 
“Aiming for A” shareholder resolution 
at our 2016 AGM, last year we 
welcomed the launch of the 
recommendations of the Taskforce 
on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD). We have stated 
publicly our support for the TCFD,  
and details of our progress in 
identifying and addressing the risks 
and opportunities resulting from 
climate change for our business  
are included in this report and the 
upcoming 2017 Sustainability Report.
We face many challenging situations 
at our operations, as we work to 
extract resources safely, profitably  
and responsibly, to mitigate our 
environmental impact and support 
our host communities. We recognise 
the value of multi-stakeholder 
dialogue in addressing these complex 
situations through shared learnings 
and expertise. 
This year we have participated in a 
number of such initiatives, including 
those focused on management of 
security, development of guidance on 
human rights for the commodities 
trading sector, and addressing the 
challenges associated with the cobalt 
value chain. Looking ahead, we seek 
to continue to strengthen our 
engagement in these platforms,  
and to identify opportunities for 
partnerships that can help us solve 
the complex challenges we 
encounter at and around 
our operations.
We remain committed to 
transparency, and in 2017 on a 
voluntary basis we published our first 
report on the steps we are taking to 
review modern slavery in our supply 
chain, and will be providing a further 
update this year.
There are many opportunities and 
challenges ahead for resource 
businesses. I believe that Glencore 
will continue to play a leading role  
in sustainable value creation for all 
our stakeholders.
