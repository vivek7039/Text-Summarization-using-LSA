Chief Executive’s Business Review 
 
Investing through the cycle 
for the long-term 
“With the investments 
made, this is now a 
business poised for 
growth” 
 
 
“With the benefit of another year’s worth of investment in Peter Brotherhood, the 
completion of our Centre of Excellence and the early signs of improvements in our end 
markets the Group is well positioned to capitalise on potential growth opportunities” 
 
Setting HTG’s priorities 
Our FY2017 focus 
 Continue to focus on implementing our strategy for growth through product and 
market development; 
 Continue to increase order intake through improvements to the ‘win-order’ process 
across all markets; 
 Re-establish Peter Brotherhood and embed the business in the Group; and 
 Continue to look for wider opportunities to develop and grow the Group. 
Achievements 
 Ended the year with a record order book and a clear strategy of how to drive 
further growth in order intake going into the new fiscal year;  
 Continued to rebuild accreditations and customer relationships at Peter 
Brotherhood with our first major order won and first significant order 
shipped; 
 Created a new Group Commercial role, recruited a new person to the role 
and put in place a new structure to support the ‘win-order’ process; 
 Completed the major investment in our world-class Centre of Excellence for 
specialist motor manufacture; and 
 Welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to open our new facility and 
present us with the Queen’s Award for Export (International Trade). 
Priorities for FY2018 
 Secure a suitable funding structure to support the long-term future of the Group to 
take advantage of the opportunities for both Peter Brotherhood and Hayward Tyler; 
 Drive further growth in order intake reflecting the improving market conditions and 
the Group’s competitiveness; 
 Cut the Group’s cost base to support a more flexible and profitable business; and 
 Continue to deliver the operational improvements supported by the increased order 
book.  
 
Introduction 
When I wrote in last year’s review that “provided recent economic and political uncertainty 
does not affect general industrial activity, the outlook for HTG is positive” I perhaps did not 
appreciate how prescient that comment might be.    
 
From a financial perspective the year can be characterised using the sporting analogy, “a 
game of two halves”. The first half was disappointing but our second half was much more in  Hayward Tyler Group PLC

line with previous periods and more representative of the underlying Group and its future 
prospects. We increased the run rate on an annualised basis to over £80.0 million of 
revenues and over £8.0 million of EBITDA and achieved a record order book entering the 
current fiscal year. However, the loss in the first half combined with the order intake not 
happening quick enough to be fully reflected in second half revenue and profit meant that for 
the first time as Hayward Tyler Group PLC we were not able to either meet or beat market 
expectations.  
  
Win-Order Process – Ready to Deliver 
Looking beyond the numbers the Group continued to make significant progress in positioning 
itself for the anticipated improvement in its end markets. A huge amount of time, effort and 
investment has gone into the ‘front-end’ of the business focused on marketing, sales and the 
‘win-order’ process. Key to this action was the appointment of Dr Colin Elcoate to the newly 
created position of Chief Commercial Officer with responsibility for global commercial activity 
across the Group. Colin joined from Clyde Union Pumps and has previously held senior 
positions at Babcock and Rolls Royce. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers 
and a nuclear expert with over 25 years’ experience, so it is great to have him on board at 
such an important time. Already positive changes have been made to the organisational and 
commercial structure to support our growth plans including: 
 
 Specific roles for sales, business development, product management and marketing 
communications; 
 Tightened bid/no-bid and contract review processes; and 
 Salesforce.com roll-out and linking to our ERP systems. 
 
The resurrection of the Peter Brotherhood name and brand has continued apace during the 
year with the re-engagement of past customers and the identification of our installed base 
being key. There is no doubt that the removal of the Peter Brotherhood name from the market 
and associated approved vendor lists by the previous owner of the business has made the 
challenge of resurrection more difficult but it is a gradual process and one to which the 
employees and wider stakeholders are responding well. In the past 12 months over forty 
customer approvals have been achieved, the first major order won and first significant order 
shipped so there is no doubt that the former pedigree of Peter Brotherhood is being brought 
back to life. Peter Brotherhood still has an enviable reputation in specific market niches and 
the challenge is to strengthen and broaden it. As an example, in the floating vessels market 
Peter Brotherhood has more steam turbine gensets on FPSOs than all of its competition 
combined. This clearly stands Peter Brotherhood in good stead when the anticipated pick-up 
in the floating vessels new build/retrofit market recovers. Peter Brotherhood also remains a 
key strategic supplier to Rolls Royce and ultimately the Royal Navy in the UK having provided 
all of the steam turbine gensets to the Astute boats. One of Peter Brotherhood’s advantages 
is that it remains an ‘independent’ supplier and as such can be more flexible in terms of 
product offering and response times than its larger, global rivals. 
 
The Group has continued to invest in numerous exhibitions globally to broaden the reach, 
particularly of Peter Brotherhood, to try to expand the brand to a wider global population.   
Over the past twelve months this has resulted in exhibitions and conferences in South Africa, 
the USA, China, India and the UK.  
 
Order Intake and Order Book 
Order intake increased by 11% to £68.3 million, helped by a full year’s contribution from Peter 
Brotherhood, which contributed £16.2 million thus meaning that overall our order intake KPI 
target of 1.1x (ratio of order intake to historical revenue) was achieved. Hayward Tyler’s order 
intake actually declined slightly by 4% to £52.1 million reflecting a slowdown in its end 
markets both in terms of new units but also, in particular, a slowdown in the shop-service 
activities of our US business as outages were postponed. 
 
The strong second half order intake contributed to a record order book as at 31 March 2017 
which stood at £49.8 million, an increase of 38% over the prior year. This represented an 
increase in both Hayward Tyler of 36% (from £26.7 million to £36.2 million) and Peter 
Brotherhood of 45% (from £9.4 million to £13.6 million). So despite the downturn in the  Hayward Tyler Group PLC

Group’s end markets there was still a healthy split between both geography and sector. Key 
order wins for the period included KHNP in South Korea for nuclear replacement units, 
Eureka for submersible motors for offshore topside deployment, numerous power contract 
wins with key customers in China and India, and strategically important contracts with new 
customers in Peter Brotherhood. 
 
Pipeline 
Whilst the Group achieved its KPI target for order intake during the year the key challenge 
looking forward is how to maintain, develop and grow a greater level of order intake to ‘feed’ 
the newly invested and improved facilities.   
 
Part of the investment made in the ‘win-order’ process highlighted above has been to pull 
together a universal and consistent approach to the pipeline of opportunities across the Group 
(both in terms of customer, market segment and geography). This has highlighted a pipeline 
of over £500 million worth of opportunities which has been ranked according to whether it is at 
the research, pre-bid, bid or negotiation stage. To support this constantly evolving pipeline 
specific opportunities are then highlighted and an active account-based marketing approach 
applied aimed at increasing the chances of conversion from pipeline to order intake. 
 
Development and Future Growth 
We continued to invest in research and development (“R&D”) during the year spending £0.6 
million of which £0.3 million was capitalised. Our focus has been on the development of the 
next generation of products and services in order to expand the potential addressable 
markets into which both Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood can sell. Numerous projects 
are therefore on-going across both businesses but simplistically they can be split into the 
following growth categories: 
 
 Product development – looking at opportunities to provide a ‘motor above pump’ 
package to increase our scope of supply to the offshore oil industry; 
 Market development – developing and extending our range of compressors for the 
downstream refining market; and 
 Diversification – developing our wet-wound motors to provide a generator for tidal 
applications. 
 
Analysis of the expansion into new markets, new products and a combination of both opens 
up further opportunities for the Group’s niche offerings by a significant factor representing 
billions of pounds worth of opportunity, addressable over the medium to long-term. Specific 
examples include: 
 
 Partnership with the University of Edinburgh 
Hayward Tyler has been working with the University of Edinburgh, to develop a 
generator to harness wave energy and convert it to power. The C-Gen Neptune 
generator has been developed to a working prototype and Hayward Tyler has now 
secured over £0.7 million of funding to support the manufacture and development of 
this technology at the recently completed Centre of Excellence. 
 
 Development of alliance agreement with FSubsea 
Hayward Tyler’s motor and qualified penetrator technology has been selected for 
adoption to support the subsea deployment of the FSubsea Omnirise system. The 
prototype won this year's OTC Spotlight on New Technology Award and is due to be 
tested as a full-scale prototype of the world's most autonomous boosting system. This 
system has the potential to unlock single and multi-phase boosting solutions for a far 
wider number of subsea wells than can currently be economically accessed using 
existing technologies thus creating significant opportunities for Hayward Tyler. 
 
The Smart Factory 
Operationally we continued to drive improvements through all our facilities focused on the key 
headline metrics of right first time (“RFT”) and on time in full (“OTIF”). Our Peter Brotherhood 
facility in Peterborough is world-class and primed ready to support the anticipated uptick in 
the FPSO and steam turbine mechanical drive market. Our facility in Hayward Tyler,  Hayward Tyler Group PLC

Colchester, has made significant strides along its lean journey over the past five years driving 
down lead times in its service value stream from over 25 weeks to less than 7 weeks whilst 
doubling on-time delivery to over 90%. In our Luton-based Centre of Excellence we were 
particularly proud to have recently won the UK prestigious “Smart Factory” of the year award 
(having already been shortlisted for World-Class Manufacturing) ahead of the likes of Ricardo 
UK Ltd and Siemens plc. This is testament to the significant investment made in our ability to 
ship OTIF and RFT once we have won the orders. The Smart Factory represents the twenty-
first century approach to linking seamlessly marketing and sales and operational planning. 
The linking of the process from customer order through design, manufacture, engineering, 
assembly, test, despatch and back through support, monitoring and full lifecycle maintenance 
and management, will continue to provide a real differentiator for the Group going forward. 
 
Working Together, Succeeding Together 
In addition to the focus on win-order and operational improvements the Group has also had a 
busy year in terms of gaining recognition amongst its peer group for its long-term 
development plans. At the recent Manufacturer MX Awards (supported by the UK’s Institution 
of Mechanical Engineers), Hayward Tyler was shortlisted for the Apprentice of the Year, for 
People and Skills and for World-Class Manufacturing and was successful in winning both the 
Smart Factory Award as mentioned above and also the Leadership & Strategy Award.   
 
We were also delighted to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in August 2016 to 
open the Centre of Excellence and formally present the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 
(International Trade). Over 350 employees, family members, customers and local dignitaries 
joined us for this very prestigious and historic occasion and it marked another milestone in 
Hayward Tyler’s long and rich history. 
 
Against some challenging market conditions these successes underpin the strength of the 
Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood businesses, both of whom compete against some 
much larger corporations on a global scale. Their respective abilities to ‘punch above their 
weight’ is testament to the employees we have and our shared set of values which are; Pride, 
Innovation, Pace and Excellence (see Corporate Social Responsibility). These shared values 
go to the heart of what unites us as an ever expanding Group. For this and for our employees’ 
continued fortitude, good humour and patience I thank-you with all sincerity for being part of 
two great engineering brands. 
 
Outlook 
I’ve written previously about the long-term nature of our growth plans and the market 
conditions which we’ve witnessed over the past year highlight how important it is to be able to 
invest through the cycle. Over the past five years we’ve seen the Group grow (both 
organically and through the acquisition of the Peter Brotherhood operations) from a revenue 
run rate of £32 million to over £80 million and increase in size to over 500 highly skilled, 
educated and motivated employees. We’ve seen the transformation of the main Luton facility 
into a world-class Centre of Excellence, the resurrection of the Peter Brotherhood name into a 
business that is getting back its ‘mojo’ and is hungry for growth and increased investment in 
our apprentice, graduate and employee training schemes. 
 
This is why it is great to be able to confirm the recommended acquisition of the Group by 
Avingtrans plc, another UK AIM-listed engineering group that has the balance sheet strength 
and supportive shareholder base to be able to continue to invest in both Hayward Tyler and 
Peter Brotherhood and support the Group’s longer term growth plans.

The last few years have been incredibly exciting and I’m delighted to now pass on the baton 
to a group that is looking to significantly increase shareholder value over the medium to long-
term using Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood as its springboard. 
 
Thank you
