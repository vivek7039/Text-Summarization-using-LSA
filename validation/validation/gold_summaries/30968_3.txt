trials, 4D is well placed to deliver 
meaningful clinical data to support

increasing intellectual property estate helps 
secure our leading position in the field.
As we move forward, our key goal is to 
deliver meaningful clinical data to support 
the use of Live Biotherapeutics across 
multiple indications. I believe that through 
our upcoming programme of clinical trials, 
we are well positioned to achieve this.

Our people
We could not have achieved what we have 
without the continued support of our staff 
throughout our sites in Europe, and also 
those involved in our wider collaborations.

made in 2017.

Strategic objectives
Since the Group’ s initial public offering, 4D 
has grown rapidly to become a world leader 
in the development of Live Biotherapeutics, 
an “end-to-end” microbiome company, from 
research to development and manufacture.
Our research teams continue to further the 
understanding, both of our programmes and 
their mechanisms, and of the microbiome 
generally. The past twelve months have seen 
the validation of MicroDx, our diagnostic 
platform enabling the stratification of IBS 
patients. Our GMP-certified facility in León, 
Spain, has enabled the development scale-up 
for our candidate strains and has increased 
clinical/production capacity to up to 100 
million capsules per annum. Meanwhile our
