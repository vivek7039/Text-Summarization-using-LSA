GMS AT A GLANCE
A WORLD LEADER  
IN SESVs
Gulf Marine Services is the operator of the world’s largest fleet of 
advanced self-propelled self-elevating support vessels (SESVs).
About us
GMS assets provide a stable platform for  
the delivery of a wide range of services 
performed by the Group’s national and 
international oil company clients and 
engineering, procurement and construction 
contractors throughout the life cycle of 
offshore oil and gas projects and operators 
in the renewable energy (wind farm-related) 
industry. Our vessels are capable of 
operations in water depths of up to 80m  
that are typically found in the Middle East, 
South East Asia, West Africa and Europe. 
We pride ourselves on being at the forefront 
of technological innovation and construct 
and maintain our own vessels at our 
quayside yard in Abu Dhabi. Our extensive 
new build programme in recent years has 
made the GMS fleet one of the most 
sophisticated in the industry. 
A modern fleet fit for the future 
The Group’s core fleet of 13 SESVs is amongst 
the youngest in the industry, with an average 
age of just seven years, and this makes it 
highly attractive to clients seeking to charter 
the most advanced and cost-efficient vessels 
for their current and longer-term operations. 
Our SESVs are four-legged vessels that  
move independently, with no requirement  
for anchor handling or tug support. They  
have a large deck space, crane capacity and 
accommodation facilities that can be adapted 
to the requirements of our clients. These 
vessels support our clients in a broad range  
of offshore oil and gas platform refurbishment 
and maintenance activities, well intervention 
work and offshore wind turbine maintenance 
work (which are opex-led activities), as well  
as offshore oil and gas platform installation and 
decommissioning and offshore wind turbine 
installation (which are capex-led activities).

GMS supports:
• Well intervention services and 
enhanced oil recovery
• Drilling support, completions  
and testing
• Platform construction, hookup  
and commissioning
• Platform restoration and maintenance
• Coil tubing, wireline and snubbing
• Well abandonment and 
decommissioning

commissioning and maintenance
What differentiates GMS from other operators? 
• Pioneering development of Large Class and Mid-Size Class SESVs.
• All our SESVs have four legs; this, combined with our dynamic positioning system 
on our Large Class and Mid-Size Class vessels, helps us to position our vessels 
very close to our clients’ installations and provides a significantly more stable and 
reliable platform than three-legged jackup vessels. 
• All our SESVs are self-propelled; they do not need costly support vessels for travel 
and manoeuvres, saving our clients both time and money.
• We design, build and operate our own SESVs. 
• We are at the forefront of technological innovation; we use our in-house expertise  
to enhance the design of our vessels and expand our services so that we can provide 
flexible, cost-effective, offshore support solutions to our clients.

GMS at the forefront of 
technological innovation  
for 40 years – expanding  
markets and services 
GMS was established in Abu Dhabi, UAE  
in 1977 and in 1982 pioneered the design, 
build and operation of the first purpose built 
four-legged self-propelled SESV in the Gulf. 
This Small Class vessel design provided 
clients in the Gulf with a low cost alternative 
‘workhorse’ for multi-move well servicing 
activities, with greater stability and quicker 
jacking speeds than the customary 
three-legged vessels. GMS successfully 
expanded its fleet and geographical 
coverage, from a local operation in Abu 
Dhabi to become one of the largest 
operators of self-propelled SESVs in the 
world. The Group listed on the London  
Stock Exchange in March 2014.
In 2010 the Group designed and delivered 
the first Large Class SESV. This Class 
includes dynamic positioning systems and  
is capable of working in harsh weather and 
deeper water environments. GMS was now 
able to expand its operations into Europe 
and deployed two Large Class vessels to the 
region to support clients in the oil and gas 
sector and, for the first time, in the offshore 
wind power installation market. 
From 2014 to early 2017 GMS embarked on 
a new build programme to expand the fleet 
by a further six SESVs as part of our strategy 
to widen our market opportunities. This 
included the introduction of our Mid-Size 
Class vessels, which also have dynamic 
positioning and can work in harsh weather 
environments, and these have successfully 
bridged the gap between our Large and 
Small Class vessels. In 2016, the Group 
developed the world’s first cantilever system 
for an SESV. This system, complete with  
a well workover unit, allows GMS to deliver  
a greater range of services from its  
SESVs and to carry out work that would 
otherwise be performed by more expensive  
non-propelled drilling rigs. The last of the  
six new vessels to be delivered was our 
Large Class vessel GMS Evolution, which 
was commissioned in Q2 2017.
The ongoing expansion of our services  
is part of our strategic plan to apply our 
ability to innovate technologically to diversify  
into new markets and to increase our 
geographical spread. 
Examples of industry-first projects delivered 
in 2017 can be found in the Operational 
Review on page 21. Information on some  
of the specific benefits our SESVs provide  
to clients can be found in Our Strategy in 
Action on page 13.
