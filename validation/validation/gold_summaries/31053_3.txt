SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 05
EARLIER OPTIMISM JUSTIFIED 
In my report for 2016, I advised that, given the 
strength of our then current order book and 
short-term pipeline, we anticipated that the 
growth we were seeing would continue into 
at least the first half of 2017. We also noted 
that, in keeping with the pattern over previous 
years, we anticipated that our second half-
year financial performance in 2017 would be 
substantially stronger than the first half.
This was, indeed, the case and I am pleased 
to report that our optimism and guidance was 
well placed. The Group delivered a strong 
overall performance in 2017, with results for 
full-year revenues and adjusted profits being 
comfortably in line with guidance. It is also 
pleasing to report a positive advance on net 
margins, which is in line with our strategic 
objectives.
Going into 2018 the outlook continues to be 
very encouraging.
The positive news flow across the year on 
new business wins was crowned by the 
announcement in late October of the award 
of a €18m contract with OHB System AG 
to deliver the ground station control and 
communications infrastructure for Heinrich 
Hertz, the German national satellite-
communications mission. Further contract 
wins across the Group in the last quarter of 
2017 also meant that we entered 2018 with a 
record order book of £91.3m.
Operational cash flows were very healthy 
across the year, resulting in further reductions 
in net debt and underpinning a healthy 10% 
uplift in the recommended final dividend 
payment. With the acquisition of the ANNOVA 
Systems GmbH (“Annova”) business our 
income streams (which are predominantly in 
£ sterling and €) are well balanced, providing 
an internal hedge against exchange-rate 
movements. We do not anticipate any major 
impact on profitability in 2018 from currency 
fluctuations or hedging adjustments.
Further detail on the performance of each 
division is given below. However, it is worth 
noting the overall healthy organic growth and 
impressive contract wins that contributed to 
our strong operating cash flows. Our Space 
division in particular deserves a specific 
mention for its extraordinary achievement, 
with 18% year-on-year growth in revenues 
and a 17% growth in contribution.
Of strategic note is the performance of our 
Annova division. A primary focus going into 
2017 was the integration of Annova into the 
Group. We have started a programme to align 
Annova’s internal processes with SCISYS’ 
high standards. Solid, on-going progress can 
be reported here. Its performance is closely 
aligned with the Group’s expectations at the 
time of acquisition. Delivery of a key milestone 
on Annova’s BBC newsroom contract was 
achieved in late summer, with the system now 
on air in the West Midlands and in Salford. 
Significant contract wins with MDR, ARD’s 
national news programme in Germany and 
Corus in Canada have strengthened its 
geographic footprint. Synergies with our Media 
& Broadcast (M&B) division resulted in a major 
new win for M&B with RTL in France, where 
our dira! system is already on air. 
In addition to winning the Heinrich Hertz 
project, our Space division has extended 
its footprint in the Galileo project while our 
Enterprise Solutions and Defence (ESD) 
division has seen key wins late in the year 
with Public Health England, and the Forestry 
Commission, as well as new work with a 
major defence prime contractor.
The strength of the order book within both 
our Space and ESD divisions is resulting in a 
significant expansion of their teams – with an 
associated recruitment drive. Similar growth 
has resulted in the Group opening a new 
office in Dortmund to house our M&B division. 
Strategically we are well positioned and 
confident in our ability to deliver further 
progress in 2018. 
Contingency planning is in hand to protect 
the Group from any potential adverse 
operational consequences resulting from the 
negotiations between the UK and the EU, in 
respect of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 06
We believe that SCISYS is well positioned in 
the short to medium term and that our ESD 
division might even gain from the situation. 
Any impact is likely to be felt by our Space 
division, albeit that the division has continued 
to win contracts in this current period of pre-
Brexit uncertainty which extend beyond the 
proposed Brexit date, which is encouraging. 
The Board continues to explore a wide 
range of Brexit options. While we very much 
welcome the UK government’s strong support 
for the UK’s continued participation in EU-
funded space programmes (EGNOS, Galileo 
& Copernicus) and hope to see further clarity 
on this position during the negotiations for 
the transition-stage arrangements, we are 
nevertheless preparing a range of tactical 
options (including the option of re-domiciling, 
while retaining our AIM listing and associated 
UK tax benefits) to mitigate the possible 
effects of Brexit on our Space business post-
March 2019 should negotiations not prove 
favourable.
Key financials reflect the success
In the year ended 31 December 2017, 
SCISYS posted overall revenues of £57.2m, 
which were up 25% on last year (2016: 
£45.7m). Within this figure, professional fees 
were 28% higher at £48.0m (2016: £37.6m). 
The Group delivered an adjusted operating 
profit of £4.6m (2016: £3.2m), a 44% uplift on 
2016. The operating profit was £4.7m (2016: 
£2.8m). A reconciliation between the adjusted 
and statutory operating profit measures 
appears in the Finance Director’s Report. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 10.0p 
(2016: 9.2p); basic earnings per share were 
11.5p (2016: 7.6p). Cash generation remained 
healthy and this resulted in a net inflow of 
£4.5m (2016: £2.1m). The Group’s net-debt 
position was £5.9m at year‘s end (2016: 
£10.2m). At 8% (2016: 7%), our adjusted 
operating margin has improved. The year-end 
order book was at a record level at £91.3m 
(2016: £64.6m).
Our people are the key to our success
As always, our thanks rightly go to all of 
our staff within the divisions, who actively 
implement our corporate core values of 
trust, respect and openness, combined 
with prudence and balanced growth. Their 
hard work and ability to deliver the business 
solutions that our customers need, within 
tight budgets and timescales, is the key factor 
to the on-going relationships that SCISYS 
enjoys with its many and varied long-standing 
customers. Our thanks also go to all of our 
staff within the Group’s central functions, 
who provide essential services and valued 
support to the Group and who have made an 
important contribution to these results.
Dividend
An interim dividend of 0.59p per share was 
paid on 9 November 2017. The Directors are 
now proposing a final dividend of 1.57p per 
share, subject to approval by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting on 28 June 2018. 
The proposed final dividend will be paid on 27 
July 2018 to shareholders on the register at 6 
July 2018. The shares will go ex-dividend on 
5 July 2018. This would make the dividend for 
the full year to 31 December 2017 2.16p per 
share (2016: 1.96p) and maintains our stated 
strategy of progressive dividend growth.
Governance matching our needs
We are committed to high standards of 
corporate governance. We have strong 
governance frameworks in place throughout 
the Group in balance with our risks. 
SCISYS is currently compliant to the extent 
appropriate for a company of its size with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, and 
is looking to adopt the QCA Corporate 
Governance Code during the course of 2018. 
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
The key elements of the Group’s strategy 
remain unchanged. We continue to focus 
on balanced revenue growth and margin 
improvement, as well as management/control 
of risk and succession planning. 
Outlook
We are pleased with the healthy organic 
growth in revenues achieved in 2017. Our 
strong second-half trading performance, 
combined with steadily reducing levels of 
net debt and a record year-end order book 
provides a solid platform to deliver further 
progress in 2018 and beyond.
Based on current performance on projects 
and our order pipeline across the entire 
Group, the Directors remain fully confident in 
the prospects of the Group’s future organic 
growth. We will also continue to look for 
opportunity, where there is a good market, 
product and cultural fit, to grow through 
acquisition. 
