CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Consort has delivered another

DR PETER FELLNER
Consort Medical has delivered another 
year of underlying growth and further 
enhanced its margins. It has made great 
progress in developing future growth 
prospects with a strong development 
portfolio and innovation pipeline.
TRADING
The Group’s revenue increased by 
6.2% to £294.0m (FY2016: £276.9m) with 
underlying sales growth delivered in 
both divisions. Group EBIT before special 
items increased by 8.3% to £40.0m 
(FY2016: £37.0m) demonstrating good 
operating leverage. Adjusted basic EPS 
increased by 13.1% to 65.1p per share 
(FY2016: 57.6p).
EBITDA before special items grew by 
9.1% to £52.7m (FY2016: £48.3m) and we 
made further investment in the business 
including £18.1m in capital expenditure 
(FY2016: £21.5m). 
We have continued to reduce gearing 
in line with our expectations with a 
year-end net debt of £92.6m (FY2016: 
£97.0m), representing Net debt:EBITDA 
of 1.7x.
INNOVATION AND 
DEVELOPMENT
We were very pleased to see two 
significant projects in our development 
pipeline progress through to product 
launches: the UCB Cimzia
®
 AutoClicks
®
 
pre-filled pen in the UK will be Bespak’s 
second injectable device to be 
launched. We have also been awarded 
a significant new multi-year agreement 
for the scale-up and supply of our 
proprietary pMDI valves and actuators 
for the launch of AstraZeneca’s Bevespi 
Aerosphere

 in the United States.
We continue to develop innovative 
new platforms, including a further £3.1m 
funding of Atlas Genetics point of care

combined capabilities across the Group 
to identify and deliver new and ground-
breaking solutions for our customers.

BOARD CHANGES
The Board appointed Paul Hayes as 
the Group’s Chief Financial Officer 
with effect from 1 May 2017. Paul is an 
experienced CFO in multi-national high 
technology manufacturing, consumer 
goods and retail businesses. Paul was 
previously the Group Finance Director 
of Vitec Group plc for the last six years. 
Paul is a Chartered Accountant and 
has a first class Master’s degree in 
Mechanical Engineering, Manufacture 
and Management. 
Paul replaced Richard Cotton who left 
the Board on 13 December 2016. The 
Board would like to thank Richard for his 
contribution to the Group and wish him 
well as he embarks on the next stage of 
his career. The Board would also like to 
thank David Tilston for acting as interim 
CFO to ensure a smooth transition prior 
to Paul’s arrival.
PEOPLE
I wish to thank our employees for their 
contributions and commitment over the 
last year, which has been important in 
delivering the Company’s continued 
growth. I also thank our shareholders for 
their ongoing support of the Company.
OUTLOOK
Consort has again delivered further 
growth in revenue and profit ahead 
of its expectations with both divisions 
performing well. Bespak has continued 
to grow and develop its diverse pipeline 
of product opportunities in this high 
margin business. Aesica continues to 
improve its operating performance and 
its margins in line with our expectations 
and assisted by recent contract wins. 
Group performance is expected to 
be broadly in line with our near-term 
expectations for the current financial 
year, despite some headwinds from 
contract phasing. The Board remains 
confident about the prospects for  
the Group.
DIVIDEND
The Board has reviewed the dividend 
and is proposing an increased final 
dividend of 13.21p (FY2016: 12.56p) 
making a total dividend for the year of 
20.30p (FY2016: 19.31p). The dividend 
will be paid on 27 October 2017 to 
shareholders on the register at  
22 September 2017, following our AGM 
on 6 September 2017.
