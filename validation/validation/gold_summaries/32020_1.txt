 STRATEGIC REPORT
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 12 –
It has been a year of tremendous progress for the Group. Our 
teams have worked extremely hard to maintain the positive 
momentum in our manufacturing business and to successfully 
integrate and accelerate the growth of the acquired The Brand 
Architekts business. Within The Brand Architekts’ portfolio it is 
pleasing to report that all major brands and major customers 
are showing year on year growth and that the pace and quality 
of new product launches have continued seamlessly. This is 
a great credit to the team at Teddington who have proved 
themselves to be as talented, professional and committed as 
we had hoped at the time of acquisition.
In the manufacturing business, our ability to support our 
customer base with the innovation, quality and service 
they require has enabled us to continue to grow sales and 
contribution margins against strong prior year comparators 
and the headwinds of significant raw material and packaging 
inflation. Our reputation and relationship has been enhanced 
across several key customers, both longstanding and new,  
as we have successfully supported a number of critical 
product launches for them which contributes to current 
business performance and augurs well for future projects.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REPORT
OUR BUSINESS AND STRATEGY
WHAT WE DO
MANUFACTURING
Swallowfield plc is a market leader in the development, 
formulation, and supply of personal care and beauty products, 
including its own portfolio of brands.  
Our business strategy is to leverage our Group expertise, 
resources and assets across two complimentary and 
connected value streams, owned brands and manufacturing.  
Within each value stream we have three strategic pillars which 
we believe are the critical focus areas to ensure we continue  
to grow these businesses in the medium and long term. 
Our manufacturing business focusses on the development, 
formulation, and supply of personal care and beauty products 
for customers which include many of the world’s leading 
brands. Through continued investment and execution of our 
Drive Category Focus, our offering to those customers 
has become increasingly differentiated, which has the dual 
benefit of a positive impact on margin contribution and also 
improving our competitive advantage, thereby making the 
Group more resilient.

STRATEGIC REPORT
– 15 –
Over the last three years we have developed, both organically 
and through acquisition, a growing portfolio of brands that are 
owned and managed by the Group and which we control from 
formulation through to distribution. The acquisition of The 
Brand Architekts in June 2016 has significantly accelerated this 
owned brand pillar and brought critical mass to our portfolio, 
now representing 24% of Group revenues in the period. 
The convergence of a number of macro trends has created 
a significant and demonstrable opportunity for smaller more 
agile companies to create and profitably grow well-crafted 
and well positioned brands in the Personal Care and Beauty 
sector. National retailers are keen to support brands that can 
differentiate their offering and thereby drive shopper loyalty. 
Digital channels and social media allow brands to deliver 
well targeted, fast and flexible consumer communication 
campaigns at a fraction of the cost of traditional media. 
Smaller companies are able to identify trends and develop  
new products without the time consuming and complex 
decision-making processes that can often be a feature of 
larger global companies.
Bringing together the product development, production 
and supply chain expertise of Swallowfield with the proven, 
creative and dynamic brand management team of The Brand 
Architekts creates a strong and broad capability within the 
group to profitably realise market opportunities through 
development of our owned brand portfolio.

“Fast paced new product development that quickly identifies and responds to market 
trends is a core element of our success”
JANE FLETCHER, GROUP SALES AND MARKETING DIRECTOR STRATEGIC REPORT
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 20 –
Our business strategy is developed on two complimentary 
platforms:
• the first ‘Creating for Tomorrow’ identifies within each of 
the manufacturing and owned brands value streams the 
three strategic pillars which we believe are the critical focus 
areas to ensure we continue to grow these businesses in the 
medium and long term.  
• the second ‘Delivering for Today’ identifies some key 
operational focus areas that we need to drive in order to 
deliver our more immediate (i.e. current fiscal) performance.
EXECUTING OUR
STRATEGY
The three strategic pillars that we are focussing on within our 
owned brands value stream are:
NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (NPD)
Fast paced NPD that quickly identifies and responds to  
market trends is a core element of The Brand Architekts 
business model. We are pleased that this responsiveness 
continues as part of the Swallowfield Group and that retailer 
appetite remains high. 78 new lines were launched in the 
course of the financial year across 11 different brands. Of 
particular note are a range of new beauty accessories 
launched under a new brand ‘Beautopia’, a new line of Epsom 
Salts under the Dr.Salts brand, and a new Retinol Serum in our 
SuperFacialist range. We are busy on further new ranges to be 
launched in Autumn 2017.
Progress has also continued on our original Swallowfield 
brands. The Real Shaving Company has grown strongly in the 
year thanks in part to the good performance of a new gift 
range but also the effect of digital marketing activity linked to 
the sponsorship of Somerset T20 cricket. The Bagsy Savannah 
Miller collection was launched in the year and has helped us 
to find new distribution opportunities for the brand. MR, our 
premium male hair loss brand has seen rate of sale increase 
even further with the introduction of new packaging for the 
shampoo, conditioner and styling paste lines and continued 
innovative and impactful digital marketing activity.
We have also seen very good growth in our range of value 
brands, such as Tru Shave, aimed at the growing UK value 
retail sector. We have successfully added new products to  
our offering and in doing so have extended the number of 
retail customers to virtually all the major national UK chains  
in this channel.
On 4 September 2017, we concluded a transaction to acquire a 
70% shareholding in Sterling Shave Club Ltd. Over the last two 
years Sterling has established a presence in the fast-growing 
on-line subscription shave club sector. 
The business is currently at a relatively small scale and 
our investment is appropriately modest. The entire 
consideration is to be invested into the business to support  
a significantly enhanced marketing plan directed at 
accelerating membership recruitment and expanding the 
range of products available beyond the current range of 
blades and shaving products, which currently include our  
own The Real Shaving Company range.
It offers us the opportunity to further develop our knowledge 
and capabilities in e-commerce which we believe will be 
critical to the further development of our owned brands 
business in the years ahead. 
As the business will very much be in an ‘invest to grow’ phase, 
we expect a broadly neutral impact on group profitability in 
the current financial year moving to a positive contribution in 
subsequent years.

LEVERAGE SWALLOWFIELD RESOURCES
At the time of acquisition of The Brand Architekts,  
we identified a number of opportunities to either drive 
revenue growth or create savings by leveraging the existing 
resources and capabilities of the parent business. We are 
pleased to have made excellent progress in this regard 
through the course of the year.
Several Swallowfield developed and produced products 
are now on shelf including Dirty Works Body Sprays and 
Happy Naturals footcare products. Many more projects are in 
progress covering not only new products but also the transfer 
of some existing products from other suppliers.
Swallowfield had, prior to the acquisition, developed a  
very competent digital marketing and e-commerce capability 
and we have been able to utilise these resources to launch 
digital marketing programmes and e-commerce functionality 
across Dirty Works, SuperFacialist, Quick Fix Facials,  
and Kind Natured.
PR and Marketing agencies were consolidated across the 
portfolio in the course of the year which has led to better 
quality output at lower cost.
On the Supply side, we are leveraging our materials and 
packaging sourcing network (including our China purchasing 
office), our knowledge of best practice production processes, 
and our expertise in product design and formulation to drive 
cost improvements across the inherited The Brand Architekts 
supply base. As part of this programme we have secured 
significant savings in freight and duty on shipments of gifts 
and accessories from China by combining our expertise and 
our buying power.
INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Growth in international revenues has been strong, led in 
particular by export sales to North America. Across the full 
portfolio of our brands, international sales now account for 
24% of segment sales and we are investing to grow this further 
still. We have put in place dedicated resource to grow this area 
and are pleased in the course of the year to have opened new 
distribution channels for a number of our brands in France, 
Netherlands, Austria and Chile. Additionally, we are extending 
the international reach of our Christmas gifting ranges with 
orders already having been received for USA, Turkey, Ireland 
and South Africa. STRATEGIC REPORT
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 22 –
We have continued to make measurable progress across our 
three strategic pillars in this segment of our business.
INNOVATION
Our manufacturing business relies on our ability to bring 
innovative new products to our customer base which consists 
of some of the leading global brand owners and retailers in 
the Personal Care and Beauty sector. In the financial year, we 
introduced over 200 Swallowfield developed new products, 
a level of innovation activity that compares favourably to 
prior year. We were particularly active in haircare and colour 
cosmetic products with a number of our innovations being 
taken to market by leading brands. Volumes on our innovative 
plastic aerosol products continued to grow in the period 
and during the year we have progressed projects which we 
expect will lead to the technology being introduced by other 
customers in the new financial year.
DRIVE CATEGORY FOCUS
In the reporting period, we have seen particularly strong 
growth in Personal Care Aerosols, Cosmetic Pencils, and 
Premium Liquids. In each case, recently won contracts to 
support new product launches have been a major contributor, 
underlining our position as a reliable partner for major global 
brand owners. The success of our partnership with a major 
European cosmetics company has supported a project to 
increase wood pencil capacity and improve cost efficiency 
at our Bideford site to meet growing demand. Further 
improvements in capacity and capability have been completed 
at our Wellington site with particular focus on Personal Care 
aerosols and Hot Pour products which enabled us to both 
extend existing contracts and win new ones.
COST BASE OPTIMISATION
Energy saving improvements continue at the Wellington site 
and line efficiency programmes continue to contribute to 
margin improvement across all sites. The investment in pencil 
automation in Bideford decreases cost per unit and increases 
capacity. The flexibility of our site footprint has enabled us to 
accommodate the needs of a major customer who needed to 
transfer sourcing from a dollar denominated supply chain out 
of China to a euro-denominated supply chain. 
The first wave of products were produced for The Brand 
Architekts brands in this financial year. This will now be 
accelerated with significant volumes brought in-house over 
the next 18 months.
