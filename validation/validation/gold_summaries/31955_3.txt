 Chairman’s statement
Ashmore has delivered strong operating 
and financial performance over the 
past 12 months, in particular producing 
outperformance for clients, generating net 
inflows in the second half of the financial 
year, and growing profit before tax by 24%. 
As described in the Market review, we 
feel the long-term prospects for Emerging 
Markets are extremely good, and the cyclical 
improvement in asset prices over the past 
year is translating into AuM and profit growth 
for Ashmore after a protracted period of 
weaker market conditions.
The characteristics that define Ashmore and 
provide significant competitive advantages 
have been much in evidence over the past 
year. The Group’s investment processes 
are producing excellent performance 
against both benchmarks and peer groups; 
the inherent attractions of the Emerging 
Markets asset classes are increasingly 
being recognised by investors and addressed 
by our global distribution team; the local 
platforms are growing rapidly and repaying 
investments made by the Group; the 
operating model has delivered an increase 
in profit margin through ongoing disciplined 
control of costs; and the Group continues to 
maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet 
to provide reassurance through the market 
cycle and to enable investment in growth 
initiatives such as seed capital.
The Board’s regular meetings have benefited 
from varied and detailed presentations by 
colleagues from both the global business 
units and the local asset management 
platforms. This enhances the Board’s 
understanding of the Group’s operations 
as well as providing an opportunity to 
focus on areas of topical interest, such 
as cyber security.
One of the most important features of the 
Ashmore operating model is the distinctive 
and highly effective remuneration model, 
which attracts and retains high-quality 
employees and aligns interests with 
clients and shareholders. As Simon Fraser 
describes in the Remuneration report on 
page 55, the Remuneration Committee has 
conducted a thorough review of the Group’s 
remuneration policy ahead of the triennial 
vote at the forthcoming AGM. Central to this 
review was a comprehensive programme 
of meetings with Ashmore’s largest 
institutional shareholders, to discuss and 
explain Ashmore’s remuneration philosophy 
and to understand shareholders’ views on 
the principal features of the policy. I believe 
strongly in the Group’s remuneration policy 
and participated in the majority of these 
meetings to ensure that the Board’s support 
was recognised and to address any other 
governance topics that were raised.
The Board has recommended an unchanged 
final dividend of 12.10 pence for the year 
ending 30 June 2017 to give total dividends 
per share for the year of 16.65 pence. 
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the AGM 
in October, the final dividend will be paid on 
1 December 2017 to those shareholders on 
the register on 3 November 2017.
Through its regular formal meetings with 
employees, the Board is deeply aware of the 
strong culture and work ethic at Ashmore, 
and I would like to take this opportunity, on 
behalf of all Board members, to thank our 
colleagues for their ongoing efforts to deliver 
value to clients and shareholders.
