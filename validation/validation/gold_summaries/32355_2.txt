Deliver	a	safe,	efficient	and	reliable	
service every day
 > The	volume	of	flights	we	handled	increased	by	7.6%	to	2.45	million 	
(2016: 2.28 million). We maintained our safety record, with no risk-
bearing Airprox
3
 attributable to NATS (2016: nil). 
 > Average	en	route	delay	per	flight	increased	to	10.9	seconds	(2016:	4.3 	
seconds),	reflecting	in	part	higher	than	expected	traffic.	We	enabled	
additional annual savings for airline customers of 55,900 tonnes of 
CO 2 emissions.
Deliver SESAR and transform the 
business for the future
 > We consulted customers on our revised investment plan for RP2, 
which accelerates the deployment of SESAR technology.
 > Important	milestones	included:	implementation	of	our	new	flight	data	
processor (iTEC
4
) into Prestwick upper airspace, and live trials of 
electronic	flights	strips	by	the	Terminal	Control	(TC)	operation.
Win and retain commercial business
 > We were awarded ATC and engineering contracts by George  
Best Belfast City Airport and an airspace design contract for  
Thailand. FerroNATS secured ATC contracts at three additional 
Spanish airports.
 > We renewed ATC contracts with Aberdeen, Glasgow and 
Southampton and extended our ATC contract with Luton for one 
year. We also renewed the engineering service with Highlands 
and Islands Airports. 
 > Edinburgh Airport’s ATC service will transfer to a competitor in 
March	2018.
Other priorities for 2016/17
 > We invested in April 2017 in Searidge Technologies, a provider of 
technology for remote tower services and continue to develop a 
remotely-operated airport control tower capability at Swanwick.
 > We	are	supporting	Aquila	with	the	MOD’s	Project	Marshall	and	we	
have formed a task force with our partner, Thales, to re-plan the 
delivery of the asset provision milestones.
