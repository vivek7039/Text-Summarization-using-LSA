elements of our STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan, invest in our future 
and produce encouraging results in 
volatile market conditions. ”

Overview
Renold has performed robustly this year 
against a backdrop of challenging markets. 
A first half decline in revenues was followed 
by a return to underlying growth in the 
second half. Further self-help measures 
have been delivered this year which reflect 
our ongoing commitment to the core 
objectives of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
These include the completion of two 
consolidation projects, the sale of two major 
properties in France and Australia and the 
successful integration of the Tooth Chain 
acquisition, which continues to trade ahead 
of expectations. We believe this sets a 
template for further successful acquisitions 
in the remaining years of the plan.
Our Markets
Renold’s global presence and extensive 
product offering result in a broad spread 
of end-customer industries. Customers 
are served either directly, or through 
distribution partners, and our products 
are used to satisfy maintenance and repair 
requirements in addition to supporting 
the manufacture of new equipment. 
Our end-customers generally operate in 
industrial markets which have continued 
to be impacted by broader macroeconomic 
factors and geopolitical uncertainty. 
During the year, market conditions proved 
particularly challenging in North America, 
impacting upon both Chain and Torque 
Transmission operations in the region 
and resulting in a combined 8% decline 
in regional revenue. Europe and China 
experienced growth, and in flat markets, 
we believe this is a result of improving 
market share arising from the various 
actions implemented in our STEP 2020  
Strategic Plan.
Conditions in certain sectors demonstrated 
early signs of improvement towards the 
end of the financial year. It is too early 
to determine whether this is a sustained 
improvement in market conditions, or 
whether this is another phase of volatility 
in the cycle. Whatever the case, our focus 
on delivering the underlying improvements 
required to deliver sustainable progress in 
operating margins continues.
Trading Performance
Revenue grew by 11.0% in the year, 
benefiting from foreign exchange tailwinds 
and continued strong performance of the 
Tooth Chain business acquired in January 
2016. On an underlying basis, and excluding 
the impact of acquisitions, revenue declined 
by 3.6% in the year. This decline reflects 
the continuation into the current year of 
the challenging market conditions which 
impacted performance in the second half of 
the prior year. 
This underlying reduction in revenue 
resulted in a decline in our adjusted 
underlying operating margin in the  
year which fell to 7.9% from 8.6% in the 
prior year.
Whilst this is disappointing, it is reflective of 
external market factors and our decision to 
make revenue investments to increase our 
sales and marketing activities. We continue 
to focus attention on delivering actions that 
will provide sustainable improvements in 
operating margins and have made good 
progress in these areas during the year.
The year to March 2017 is the fourth year 
of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. The Group 
has come a long way and delivered a great 
deal over these four years. The full benefit 
of the actions delivered to date have been 
diluted by challenging conditions in our 
end-user markets over the last two years. 
In spite of this, we remain confident that 
we can deliver sustainable mid-teens 
margins, the exact timing of which will be 
determined by a recovery in volumes.
STEP 2020 Strategic Plan
Further key projects have been 
successfully delivered as part of our STEP 
2020 Strategic Plan. These include the 
consolidation of the European Distribution 
Centre with the sister facility in Germany 
and the successful transfer of all UK 
Couplings manufacturing and associated 
processing into our existing Cardiff site. 
Furthermore, we have commenced a 
programme to relocate our Chain China 
manufacturing facilities from Hangzhou to 
a purpose built facility near Changzhou in 
Jiangsu province. This is a multi-year project 
which will see the construction of the new 
facility commence during the year ending 
March 2018, with the factory relocation 
expected to occur in the following year.
We have continued to invest in the 
commercial and marketing activities which 
we believe will drive organic growth. We are 
starting to see the benefit of these actions 
with underlying revenue growth in Chain 
Europe (excluding acquisitions) of 5.9%.

A number of important health and safety 
initiatives have continued through the year 
and I am very pleased that we have again 
seen further improvements in our health 
and safety culture and performance. Health 
and safety rightly remains the number 
one priority for the Board and the Group. 
Ongoing and new initiatives in this area will 
continue to drive further improvements. 
Board and People
This year saw the appointment of Ian 
Scapens as Group Finance Director after 
Brian Tenner left in order to pursue other 
opportunities.  
Ian Scapens brings extensive experience 
in all aspects of financial leadership in 
large complex organisations. He joined 
Renold from Keepmoat Group, the UK's 
leading national provider of social housing 
refurbishment and regeneration services 
and a developer of low-cost, affordable 
housing, where he was Deputy Chief 
Financial Officer.
Also during the year we welcomed David 
Landless as Non-Executive Director. He has 
significant experience at senior levels of 
international manufacturing businesses. 
Most recently, he was Group Finance 
Director of Bodycote plc from 1999 until 
his retirement earlier this year. David 
will take over the Chairmanship of the 
Audit Committee from John Allkins at the 
completion of the 2017 AGM. John will 
continue as a Non-Executive Director until 
his retirement from the Board after the 
2018 AGM.
I am delighted that both Ian and David 
have joined the Board. They bring a wealth 
of relevant experience which will stand 
the Board in good stead as we continue to 
implement our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
I would also like to take the opportunity 
to thank Brian Tenner for his substantial 
contribution to Renold over the years.
The Board continues to support the 
Executive team in reviewing and monitoring 
all activities under STEP 2020. The Board 
remains closely involved in the oversight 
of the major project deliverables. All Board 
members have continued to give additional 
time and support on a wide range of issues 
during the year.
On behalf of the whole Board, I would like to 
express my gratitude and thanks to all our 
employees for their continued hard work 
during the year. The contribution of each 
employee is valued and appreciated.

Pensions
The Group's gross retirement benefit 
obligations increased to £102.0m (2016: 
£82.9m), with the largest element of 
the increase relating to changes in the 
discount rates and inflation rates applied as 
assumptions to assess future liabilities of 
the UK scheme. This is a reduction  
of £10.4m from the position at  
30 September 2016.
The Group remains committed to 
progressively de-risking this position over 
time through a combination of agreed 
contributions to the schemes and specific 
de-risking projects as they become viable.
Dividend
The Board has decided not to recommend 
the payment of a dividend. Whilst the 
Board fully recognises the importance of 
dividends to shareholders, it believes that 
the investment opportunities available to 
the Group continue to provide the optimal 
route to increasing shareholder value. This 
approach will remain under active review 
for future periods.
Summary
Market conditions remained volatile in 
the year. Trading conditions, particularly 
in North America and South-East Asia 
remained challenging. Early signs of 
recovery are evident and are supporting 
growth in order intake, but it is too soon 
for these to be considered sustainable or 
market wide.
We have not allowed a challenging market 
to stand in the way of delivery of the STEP 
2020 Strategic Plan and have delivered 
significant business change in the year. We 
are making good progress and continue to 
believe that mid-teens operating margins 
can be delivered, supported by volume 
increases.
