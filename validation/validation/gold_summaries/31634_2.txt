FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Throughout the Strategic Report, and consistent with prior years, underlying and other alternative performance measures are used to describe the Group’s performance. 
These are not recognised under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Executive Board of the Group manages and assesses the performance 
of the business on these measures and believes they are more representative of ongoing trading, facilitate meaningful year on year comparisons and hence provide more 
useful information to shareholders. 
All underlying measures are defined in the glossary of terms on page 196. A summary of the adjustments from statutory to underlying results is shown on page 161 and 
further detailed in the consolidated income statement (page 107), reconciliation of free cash flow (page 112), note 1, segmental reporting (pages 120 to 123) and note 5,  
tax (pages 127 and 128).

STRATEGIC REPORT Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 4 The global leader
We estimate that the addressable global food 
services market is currently worth around 
£200 billion. We have around a 10% share  
of that market by sales which makes us 
the leading global provider. Given that 
approximately 75% of the market is serviced 
by regional players or in-house providers, 
we believe that there is a significant structural 
growth opportunity for us.
