Where we operate
The operational and geological 
experience we have developed

03 Inmaculada – 
expansion potential  
at our flagship mine
We believe that there is strong 
upside resource potential at the 
Inmaculada deposit with drilling 
results from our first campaign in 
six years confirming the geological 
hypothesis. We intend to continue 
to explore the area, add further 
resources and then we will be in 
position to make a decision on 
whether to expand our modular 
processing plant or to add to 
Inmaculada’s life-of-mine.
Pallancata –  
realising significant 
potential
Since its discovery in 2015, the 
Pablo area including the main 
Pablo vein and ancillary veins has 
hugely expanded its contained 
tonnage and grade. In 2017 , the 
Company received the Peruvian 
government approval to begin 
mining the Pablo vein, increasing 
the throughput up to 2,800 tonnes 
per day during 2018 and delivering 
competitive costs. 
2,800 
tonnes per day target

gold equivalent ounce target 
in 2018 at Inmaculada 
53,000 
metres of drilling

in 2018
A world-class  
asset portfolio
In 2017 , we once again delivered record 
production figures with 19 . 1 million 
attributable ounces of silver and just over 
254,000 ounces of gold. This marked the 
fifth consecutive year of output increases.

Debt reduction 
programme on track
Since the completion of the 
construction of the Inmaculada 
mine in 2015, we have been aiming 
to reduce the Company’s debt 
position. In 2017, we made further 
encouraging progress with net debt 
almost halved versus the end of 
2016 and a refinancing programme 
towards the end of the year that is 
expected to result in significant 
reductions in the Company’s 
ongoing interest payments. 
Consistently meeting 
annual production 
targets
We have built up an enviable track 
record of meeting and often 
exceeding our annual production 
targets, demonstrating the 
Company’s sensible approach to 
guidance but also the expertise we 
have built in managing our portfolio 
of complex underground narrow 
vein mines. This has been 
particularly evident in periods of 
significant price volatility over the 
last five years.
Social licence  
to operate
The Company has maintained a 
number of long-term policies which 
demonstrate our commitment to a 
safe and healthy workplace, manage 
and minimise the environmental 
impact of our operations and 
encourage sustainability by 
respecting the communities of the 
localities in which we operate. Our 
relations with local communities are 
of the utmost importance and we 
dedicate significant resources in 
recognition of the social licence 
granted to us.

economic and social environments.

Exciting  
discovery  
opportunities
Increasing our 
reserves and resources
Hochschild aims to invest in 
mineralised districts with the 
possibility to grow over time and  
we are excited by the potential to 
grow our reserves and resources. 
The discovery and subsequent 
resource growth of our Pablo vein 
district at Pallancata and the  
recent discoveries at Inmaculada 
demonstrate the efficacy of our  
low cost brownfield programme. 
We believe that there are significant 
further opportunities to extend  
the lives of our mines and expand 
their capacity.
Building a  
greenfield portfolio
Our greenfield exploration 
programme incorporates 
exploration campaigns at various 
types of project. We continue to 
develop early-stage projects that 
have the potential to move through 
the project pipeline from prospects, 
to drill targets, to Advanced Projects 
and finally, to production. In this 
regard we now have six projects in 
three different countries, all in 
jurisdictions with geological 
potential and political and 
regulatory stability.

Hochschild Mining plc 08 Earn-in and joint 
venture agreements
Hochschild is also targeting earn-in 
and joint venture type 
arrangements with junior mining 
companies who have assets in 
known jurisdictions. These 
prospects must satisfy our long 
held acquisition criteria of assets 
that are early-stage with significant 
geological upside potential and 
where we can acquire a clear path 
to control.
