CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
DURING A CHALLENGING YEAR, 
WHAT HAVE BEEN THE KEY 
HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU?
Having been with the Group for some 30 years, it is 
fair to say that this past year was one of the most 
challenging. Despite the diffi  cult trading environment, 
a key highlight was the Swiss, Southern African and 
Dubai businesses all performing relatively well. We 
continue to see growing demand for quality healthcare 
services, which is why we place such an emphasis on 
our Patients First strategy and continue to invest in our 
facilities and people. This will assist us to maintain our 
leading position in all our international markets. The 
key challenge globally is to keep healthcare aff ordable 
and to demonstrate cost-effi  cient service delivery. 
Whilst the Middle East platform performed below 
expectations during the year, largely resulting from 
issues with the Al Noor business in Abu Dhabi, 
there were several highlights in the region. In 
September 2016, we opened the new comprehensive 
cancer unit, based in the North Wing of the Mediclinic 
City Hospital, which has performed very well. When 
I look at the new services not previously off ered by 
Mediclinic Middle East, the number of lives we are 
changing through our new radiotherapy and PET scan 
services each month is encouraging. In April 2017 , the unit 
treated the fi rst cancer patient with a revolutionary form 
of radiotherapy called stereotactic body radiotherapy. 
This was delivered using Mediclinic’s True Beam Varian 
linear accelerator, the only one of its kind in the UAE. 
In Al Ain, the Mediclinic Al Jowhara Hospital had its 
fi rst full month of trading in January 2017 and is 
ramping up. It is well positioned to serve the higher 
end of the market in the region. I believe the rebranding 
of the Al Noor business to Mediclinic is an important 
milestone and underlines our commitment to deliver 
exceptional levels of private healthcare service in the 
region. Rebranding and marketing work commenced 
and will continue through the year ahead. I am pleased 
that the co-payment that was introduced in Abu Dhabi 
in July 2016 was waived with immediate eff ect on 
26 April 2017 following our ongoing dialogue with the 
relevant stakeholders in the region.

“We are determined to meet  
and exceed the expectations  
of our patients in every market  
we operate.”
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE 
REGULATORY MATTERS  
PLAYED SUCH A PROMINENT 
ROLE THIS YEAR?
Access to healthcare is a basic human right.  
It is therefore understandable that governments 
will have an interest in their particular healthcare 
system to ensure that it is efficient, accessible and 
fair to its citizens. Healthcare delivery models vary 
widely between countries with different degrees 
of participation by the private healthcare sector.  
However, the cost of delivering healthcare around the 
world is increasing. The reality is that this is largely 
driven by increased consumption from an ageing 
and growing disease-burdened population, and  
new technology.
We have a joint responsibility, working with 
governments, funders and patients, to offer affordable 
and cost-efficient services to ensure the long-term 
sustainability of healthcare provision in the countries 
in which we operate. The private sector can make 
a meaningful, cost-efficient contribution towards 
healthcare delivery. We believe that governments and 
the private healthcare sector should constructively co-
operate to find a dual system of care delivery which is 
in the best interest of the broader community.
In Switzerland, as the Federal Government and 
cantons reviewed their budgets and expenditure on 
healthcare, we saw several regulatory announcements 
during the year. Firstly, the Canton of Zurich in mid-
2016 proposed a levy based on the proportion of 
privately insured patients treated in listed hospitals. 
The Hirslanden management team committed 
significant time and resources to engaging with the 
relevant public authorities to raise concerns regarding 
the process, fairness and the impact of the proposed 
levy specifically on Klinik Hirslanden. I am pleased to 
report that in March 2017 the Cantonal Parliament 
voted not to approve the proposed levy. Secondly, 
there have been ongoing national outpatient tariff 
(TARMED) negotiations between healthcare providers 
and funders. The Swiss Federal Government released 
proposed adjustments to TARMED, as a transitional 
solution while negotiations continue to find agreement 
on a revised tariff structure. And finally, the Zurich 
Cantonal Parliament approved an amendment to the 
cantonal hospital law, providing a legal basis to create 
a list of interventions that in future should generally 
be treated as outpatient rather than inpatient services. 
Continued dialogue and engagement with the relevant 
public authorities remains key to ensuring that private 
healthcare plays a meaningful role in the broader 
healthcare delivery system. 
In South Africa, the cost of private healthcare is being 
examined by the Competition Commission through the 
Health Market Inquiry (“HMI”). T owards the end of 2016, 
the HMI published a timetable reflecting the proposed 
events for 2017. We will continue to engage with the 
HMI as we progress towards the publication of the final 
reports which they have indicated will be by the end 
of 2017. 
As I mentioned previously, from 1 July 2016, the Abu 
Dhabi authorities introduced a 20% co-payment for 
Emiratis who are members of the Thiqa insurance 
option, when they make use of private healthcare 
providers. This had a material impact on our Abu Dhabi 
business, affecting the volume of Thiqa patients visiting 
our facilities. We are focused on growing our patient 
numbers from the Thiqa and enhanced insurance 
market. This strategy is supported by the new business 
and operational practices, the ongoing upgrade and 
investment programmes across our facilities, and the 
rebranding of the business to Mediclinic. The waiving of 
the co-payment in Abu Dhabi from late April 2017 will 
help to support our anticipated gradual improvement 
in Middle East performance as we move through the 
coming financial year.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF 
MEDICLINIC BEING A GLOBAL 
HEALTHCARE PROVIDER?
We have built a diversified portfolio of operating 
platforms in Switzerland, Southern Africa, and the 
Middle East and in the UK we have our 29.9% investment 
in Spire Healthcare. Combined with our strong 
market position in our operating regions, Mediclinic  
benefits from a pool of skilled, knowledgeable and 
experienced employees.
Group initiatives to simplify, standardise and centralise 
key business support processes are ongoing. Using 
our international scale, we are beginning to deliver 
meaningful synergies and cost savings. During the year, 
our central procurement function and ICT department 
made excellent progress in some key contract 
negotiations that will benefit the future profitability of 
the Group.
Although clinical models differ from country to 
country, the basic principles are similar, and it is 
useful to compare and share clinical experience 
and learnings among our operating platforms. The 
breadth of intellectual property across the Group is 
vast. We strive to nurture the combined knowledge, 
skills and experience from our diverse group of 
people to improve the Group’s clinical performance 
and growth opportunities.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 13 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
It is vital that we share best practice at an international 
level, as this will ensure we continue to deliver  
high-quality, cost-efficient services to our patients. The 
comprehensive cancer centre in Dubai is an example 
of how we tapped into the clinical experience and 
knowledge of the Hirslanden team in Switzerland to 
assist with the design, building and opening of our 
first comprehensive cancer centre in the Middle East. 
Having access to such valuable sources of knowledge 
and skills lowers the risk of venturing into new complex 
clinical service lines. 
WHAT ARE YOUR PRIORITIES 
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE 
YEAR AHEAD AND BEYOND?
Our Group focus on Patients First will continue to 
be our top priority. We are determined to meet 
and exceed the expectations of our patients in 
every market in which we operate. To assist us  
in identifying areas for improvement, we implemented 
a standardised international Patient Experience Index 
(“PEI”) measurement system, provided by Press Ganey. 
The PEI system is well embedded in our Southern 
Africa and Dubai businesses, and is being rolled out 
in the Hirslanden and Abu Dhabi businesses, the 
results of which are referenced to in the Sustainable 
Development Highlights on page 57. We continue 
to focus on providing superior clinical performance 
in a safe clinical environment while moving towards  
a better integrated healthcare delivery model.
As I have mentioned, the acquisition of the Al Noor 
business in Abu Dhabi has proved to be challenging. 
While significant progress has been made, we continue 
to focus on resolving these matters and stabilising 
performance; this will remain a priority. Our confidence 
in the long-term growth opportunities of the Middle 
East region remains strong, and we expect performance 
AR
to improve gradually as we progress through the year 
ahead. A key focus is to establish the Mediclinic brand 
as a trusted and preferred provider of clinical services 
to the Abu Dhabi community.
Another priority is the continued improvement 
in operational efficiencies, using our combined 
international intellectual property. We will continue 
to focus on finding ways to simplify our business and 
to standardise processes and structures. This will 
allow us to use our scale to unlock further synergies 
in areas such as procurement, information and 
communications technology, clinical services, human 
resources and marketing.
Finally, we will look to grow the Group at existing 
platform levels by attracting more patients, adding 
further capacity to existing facilities, adding new 
service lines, and identifying bolt-on acquisition 
opportunities. In addition, we will evaluate potential 
new opportunities for further valued added growth. 
In the Middle East, the building of the Mediclinic 
Parkview Hospital in Dubai with some 170 beds has 
commenced. We approved the development of a 
comprehensive cancer unit at the Mediclinic Airport 
Road Hospital in Abu Dhabi, where work is expected 
to start soon. 
I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses, support 
staff and management for their dedication and 
commitment to the Group and what we stand for.  
I am confident that the year ahead will be successful.
