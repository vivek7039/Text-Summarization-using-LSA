STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Looking at Genel from an external 
perspective it was clear that the Company 
operated in a challenging environment, but 
it had demonstrated resilience while retaining 
real growth potential. In 2017 Genel delivered 
on that potential.
I am now more confident than ever that, 
while challenges remain, there is material 
upside in the Genel portfolio and significant 
opportunities ahead. As we enter 2018, 
I believe that we have both the right strategy 
to take advantage of these and the right 
management team to deliver on that strategy.
The macroeconomic climate altered again in 
2017. On the positive side, the increase in the 
oil price helped to boost cash flows from our 
producing assets, and also provided a more 
solid basis for the economy of the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq (‘KRI’). The unfortunate events 
in the KRI in the last quarter of the year and 
the subsequent material reduction in KRG 
exports caused by these events significantly 
disrupted the status quo. However, despite the 
decrease in oil exports, the KRG continued to 
demonstrate its ability and willingness to make 
payments, and Genel has received payments 
for sales on a monthly basis since September 
2015. This has enabled investment by the 
Company to continue.
Financial strength 
underpinning opportunity
Genel is currently on a sound financial 
footing, and continues to generate significant 
free cash flow, something boosted by 
the signing of the Receivable Settlement 
Agreement (‘RSA’) in August 2017. The 
successful refinancing in December then 
provided a bedrock from which we can move 
forward with a proactive growth strategy.
There are exciting opportunities available 
for cash-generative, proactive companies, 
and the Board and management carried out 
a comprehensive review of Genel strategy in 
order to define a clear and focused roadmap 
to creating significant shareholder value. The 
refreshed strategy focuses on the creation 
of shareholder value, providing growth 
opportunities while retaining a firm focus 
on prudent financial planning. 
Our strategy builds on our core strengths – 
a robust and cash-generative asset portfolio, 
technical and commercial expertise, and our 
ability to leverage regional relationships and 
manage risk in complex areas. These were 
key drivers behind our excellent performance 
in 2017.
We have significant organic development 
options within Genel’s KRI portfolio, 
the financial ability to add assets to the 
portfolio, and management with the skills 
and experience to maximise the value of 
these opportunities. 
Focus on cost and capability
Genel will continue to ensure that its cost 
base reflects the external economic situation. 
Total general and administrative cash costs 
were more than halved from 2014 to 2016, 
and the Company continues to ensure the 
most appropriate structure and cost base 
from which to grow and deliver maximum 
value to stakeholders. In 2017 reductions 
were made to remuneration at all levels, 
and executive remuneration brought into 
line with comparable listed E&P companies.
Side by side with this focus on cost, is a 
focus on operational capability. There has 
been significant change at both Board and 
management levels over the last twelve 
months or so, and we have a high-quality 
team working well together. As we go 
forward, the Board will work to ensure 
continuity at management level and provide 
leadership on management succession.
In 2017 we welcomed Tim Bushell and Martin 
Gudgeon to the Board, adding relevant skills 
and experience. Both have made a significant 
contribution to the healthy dynamics and 
strong processes confirmed by an external 
board evaluation review carried out at the 
end of 2017. 
Despite changes to personnel, one thing 
that has not changed has been the Company-
wide focus on health, safety, and responsible 
operations. Genel takes pride in its operations 
and strives for positive community impact, 
and it was pleasing to see a repeat of 2016’s 
performance in achieving no lost-time 
incidents, while reducing incidents of primary 
containment loss to a single minor event. 
I would like to thank all employees across 
our operations for their ongoing vigilance 
and hard work.
Focus in 2018
We have a robust balance sheet, a clear 
strategy, and the correct team to implement 
it. Going through 2018 we look forward to 
clearly setting out the growth potential that 
this provides, and as such plan for active 
capital market engagement.
We appreciate the patience and confidence 
that our shareholders have shown in Genel 
over the last few turbulent years, and hope 
that the successes seen in the second half 
of 2017, and our strong financial position, 
provide renewed confidence that we 
can deliver on our plans to add material 
shareholder value in the years to come.
We have a robust financial 
position, a clear strategy, 
and the correct team 
to implement it.
