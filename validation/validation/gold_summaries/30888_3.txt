 ENHANCING 
our business
Results overview
In my first year as Chairman of Spectris, it is pleasing to see  
the Group deliver a 6% increase in constant currency, organic  
(like-for-like, ‘LFL’
1
) sales, driving an 8% LFL increase in adjusted 
operating profit. Reported sales increased 13% in 2017 to  
£1,525.6 million and reported operating profit increased to  
£182.4 million resulting in operating margins of 12.0%  
on a reported basis and 14.7% on an adjusted basis. Cash 
conversion
2
 was 75% of our adjusted operating profit following  
a material step-up in growth capex in our Test and Measurement 
division. Adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) increased by 14% to 
145.1p with reported basic EPS at 197.0p. 
The Group continues to make good progress on the delivery of its 
strategy and during the year, we made a number of changes to our 
portfolio, including bolt-on acquisitions and a divestment. Following 
these transactions, the Group’s financial position is robust, with net 
debt at £50.5 million at the year end.
The Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 37.5 pence per 
share which, combined with the interim dividend of 19.0 pence, 
gives a total of 56.5 pence per share for the year, an increase of 
9%. This is consistent with our policy of making progressive 
dividend payments based upon affordability and sustainability.  
The dividend will be paid on 29 June 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 25 May 2018. The ex-dividend 
date is 24 May 2018.
Following the sale of Microscan in October 2017, post-tax cash 
proceeds of approximately £91.9 million have been received.  
The Board has, therefore, approved a share buy-back programme 
of £100 million to take place during 2018 and into 2019. The 
Group has considerable financial flexibility and will continue to 
target acquisitions in support of its strategy. 
Clear strategic direction
As a leading supplier of productivity-enhancing instrumentation  
and controls, we provide a combination of highly-specialised 
measuring instruments, software and services for some of the most  
technically-demanding industrial applications. We aim to enhance 
our profitable growth by providing our customers with key insights 
alongside our instruments and, to this end, we are progressively 
adding further software and analytical capabilities and test services 
to our product offerings. This will be focused on key industries and 
will provide customers with insights and solutions focused on their 
specific business needs. These competencies will be added to our 
operating companies by organic investment, software and services 
acquisitions and the deployment of data capture and connectivity 
technology as part of our digital strategy. We will be well placed to 
offer the information and insights to enhance the productivity and 
regulatory compliance of our customers.
 
Our Group has historically focused on the benefits gained from a 
decentralised operating model, but to better serve our customers, 
we have started to evolve our operating model to increase the 
co-ordination between companies across key business functions 
and to leverage our scale. In support of this transformation, our 
Project Uplift programme is now in progress to optimise efficiency 
and effectiveness both within and also across our operating 
companies. In turn, by increasing efficiency and reducing 
complexity, we will free up the resources that will accelerate 
the implementation of our strategic ambition.
Our people 
Integral to the success of Spectris are the skills, experience and 
technical know-how of our employees. As we move forward with 
the delivery of our strategy, it is inevitable that the way in which 
we work together will evolve. I thank all our employees for both the 
contribution during the year and also for their support in driving the 
business forward. 
To ensure the delivery of our strategic objectives, we have 
made a number of key appointments to lead the more significant  
Group-wide initiatives. In particular, appointments have been 
made to deliver a new digital platform, key account management, 
lean initiatives, human resources management and improved supply 
chain management. These will all help to develop best practice  
and, in combination with a talent management programme,  
will ensure we have both the right skills and capabilities in 
place across the Group. 
In remembrance
Dr John Hughes CBE 
In June 2017, Dr John 
Hughes, the former Group 
Chairman, sadly passed 
away. John joined the Board 
as a Non-executive Director 
in June 2007 and became 
Non-executive Chairman of Spectris in May 2008. During  
his tenure, John played a pivotal role in the Company’s 
development. He made a significant contribution to the 
Group’s strategic progress, offering great insight, intellect 
and robust challenge. The Board is deeply grateful for his 
commitment to the role and to the legacy that his leadership 
has left in terms of the Company’s clear strategic direction.
Chairman’s Statement
2 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Alongside this, our ethics and values are central to Spectris, guiding 
our decision-making and ensuring that we always comply with the 
highest standards. Our Code of Business Ethics is fundamental to 
the effective and responsible management of the business and 
for the delivery of shareholder value over the long term and I am 
pleased to see such a strong commitment to this across the Group.
Board update
I am delighted to have joined your Board as Non-executive 
Chairman in May 2017. Since joining the Board, I have visited the 
majority of our operating companies and have seen an open and 
transparent culture with a strong set of values that are in evidence 
across the Group. There is a clear sense of ‘doing the right thing’ 
and the discussion and debate at all levels of the Group is 
engaging, constructive and appropriately challenging.
During the year, we made two appointments to the Board.  
In January 2017, Kjersti Wiklund joined as a Non-executive 
Director and has brought significant knowledge of the international 
telecommunications sector to the Board’s deliberations. In July, 
Karim Bitar was appointed as a Non-executive Director. Karim 
is chief executive of Genus plc, an agricultural biotechnology  
pioneer, and has extensive experience of leading international, 
technology-focused organisations, in particular in the 
pharmaceutical sector. I also express my thanks to Russell King, 
Senior Independent Director, for assuming the Chair earlier in 
the year following the illness of my predecessor, Dr John Hughes.
2017 has been a positive year, 
both in terms of operational 
performance and strategic 
delivery. We will continue our 
strategic evolution to offer 
customers increasing insights  
and solutions alongside our  
world-class instruments.

Chairman
Summary 
2017 has been a positive year, both in terms of operational 
performance and strategic delivery. It was particularly pleasing 
to record strong organic growth this year. Our aim is to continue 
to deliver organic growth and further improve the Group’s 
profitability, while maintaining a robust financial position. We 
will continue our strategic evolution to offer customers increasing 
insights and solutions alongside our world-class instruments. The 
strategic initiatives that we have launched have positioned us for 
delivering value both to our customers and to our shareholders, 
and this provides the Board with confidence that the Company is 
well placed for the future.
