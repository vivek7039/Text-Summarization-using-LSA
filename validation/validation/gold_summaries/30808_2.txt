FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The effectiveness of our strategy is reflected in the record 2017 financial results highlighted below.
* Profit from continuing operations — GEL 403.5 million (+9.0% y-o-y); Profit from discontinued operations — GEL 59.9 million (+2.8% y-o-y).
** Tier 1 Capital Ratio (NBG Basel III) at 31 December 2017 – 12.4%.
*** Including discontinued operations.
**** In 2017, we changed the Group’s accounting policy in relation to subsequent measurement of office buildings and service centres from revaluation model to cost model.  
We have accordingly restated the balance sheet accounts for affected periods, while the change did not have any material impact on the income statement. In addition,  
we started presenting Aldagi as part of the Investment Business since 2Q17. Therefore, Banking Business balance sheet and income statement accounts, and the ratios  
have been updated accordingly for prior periods presented to reflect these changes.
