 As we move into the third year of our 
transformation of Carpetright, we are 
maintaining the consistency of our 
strategic direction which has been to 
focus exclusively on:
 – Who we are – our stores, the brand 
and our people
 – What we sell – an unrivalled choice 
of floorcoverings
 – How we sell – making the process 
easy with unbeatable value
 – Where we sell – multi-channel 
convenience and improving the quality 
of the store portfolio
This proven strategy is supported by 
clear, uncomplicated principles that 
are applied consistently throughout the 
business, specifically:
 – We are honest and straightforward
 – We care about customers and 
colleagues
 – We make it easy
We review the progress made across the 
year in each area of strategic focus in the 
following sections:
Who we are
Our principles are the essence of 
our Group-wide ‘We are Carpetright’ 
initiative, which is driving cultural change 
throughout the business with the aim 
of updating customers’ perceptions of 
the brand. This work is central to our 
success, as we modernise the store estate 
and the way we do things around here.
Refurbishment of the store estate and 
introduction of our new branding and 
store-fit was a major focus during the year.  
By the end of April 2017, we had 199 
stores in the UK trading under the new 
brand identity, some 47% of the estate, 
completing 160 refurbishments during 
the year, more than our original target 
having accelerated the programme twice 
in the course of the period. This work 
ranged from introducing new signage 
and a sample area for carpet in stores 
that make a smaller profit, through 
to full refurbishment of larger, highly 
profitable stores, or stores where we 
are tackling new competition. In these

sure we are the first choice for  
the floorcoverings consumer, 
every time.”
latter two cases, the introduction of 
our new ‘Graphite’ store-fit is proving 
highly successful in regenerating sales 
growth. As a group, refurbished stores 
delivered like-for-like sales growth of 
6.8% in the final quarter of the year, 
markedly higher than the un-invested 
estate (Including stores refurbished 
expressly to meet new competition this 
figure would be 5.0% growth). This gives 
us confidence to press ahead with the 
investment programme. We are aiming 
to have completed the remainder of the 
UK estate with some form of additional 
investment (at a minimum, re-branding 
with the new identity) by December 2018.
We have a similar programme underway 
to address the un-invested estate in the 
Netherlands and Belgium. As at the 
end of April 2017, we had refurbished 
an initial nine stores and they have 
achieved excellent sales growth post-
refurbishment. We see this as a 
significant opportunity to increase share 
and profitability and are in the process 
of refurbishing a further twelve stores by 
the end of July 2017. If we can achieve 
similar levels of sales growth, we will look 
to accelerate the programme across the 
remaining stores in the Netherlands and 
Belgium during the coming months.
Further improving our reputation and 
being readily identified as a brand that 
customers can trust is vital to Carpetright’s 
future success. Our recruitment of 
Lucy Alexander, previously a presenter 
on BBC TV’s cult home improvement 
programme ‘Homes under the Hammer’, 
as Carpetright Brand Ambassador in the 
summer of 2016 has been a key initiative 
in this area. We have supported this 
move with extensive brand sponsorship 
on UKTV featuring Lucy, who is a credible 
home improvement personality. Customer 
research shows this activity is yielding 
positive results on brand metrics such 
as awareness, trust and consideration.
Equally, Carpetright achieving 
‘Which? Trusted Trader’ status for our 
recommended fitting service is another 
important element to improving brand 
perception and ‘Making it Easy’. This 
standard gives potential customers the 
comfort that the final and most important 
Strategic report continued
10 | Annual report and accounts 2017 part of the customer journey, the fitting, 
and that “ta da” moment, is going to 
be carried out by carefully selected and 
properly assessed trades people. ‘Who we 
are’ also incorporates our new colleague 
uniform which was successfully rolled out 
last year to give teams a comfortable, 
contemporary identity.
It also covers our culture and the way 
we train and talk with our colleagues.  
To this end we have introduced ‘Fuse’, 
which is a brand new internal training and 
communications tool, built around a single 
platform for mobile, social and programme 
learning and development as well as 
internal communications. The training 
element covers everything from “the 
basics”, through product knowledge, 
as well as customer service and selling 
skills. It is also a tool to encourage 
ongoing management development and 
Fuse will be at the heart of our launch of a 
Carpetright Managers’ Academy in 2017.
Video based communication offers a 
much more dynamic live update for store 
colleagues.  The ‘Staff Room’ element on 
Fuse allows for open feedback from staff 
that will help us improve, by being honest 
and straightforward with each other and 
accepting of constructive criticism.
What we sell
The floorcoverings market does not stand 
still. Through market research we know 
consumer tastes are changing and they 
tell us what they want to buy for their 
home. The UK market is currently split 
60/40 on carpets versus hard flooring, 
while Carpetright, because of its heritage, 
has a split of 90/10 in favour of carpet.
Our move over recent years to increase 
our share of the hard flooring market 
is already well documented. We have 
enjoyed particularly good growth in hard 
flooring as we have introduced ranges 
into all of our stores, with a clear product 
and price architecture, for customers from 
budget spend right through to £100 per 
square metre and over, with sufficient 
cross-over between categories to allow 
customers to trade up if they choose:
 – Vinyl – from roll stock, for the take 
away and DIY market, to premium 
quality sample vinyl which is specifically 
ordered for professional fitting;
 – Laminate – again in the budget, DIY 
take away form or in a new range of 
sampled product for third party fitting;
 – Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT) has now been 
introduced across the estate, becoming 
our fastest growing category (albeit 
from a low base), offering customers 
the natural look of wood or stone but 
with the features and benefits of easy 
to maintain vinyl; and
 – Engineered Wood – a superior and 
more stable product than traditional 
solid wood, supplied to us by Kahrs, 
the leading Swedish supplier of 
environmentally friendly and sustainable 
flooring products.
In carpet, we continue to strengthen our 
range authority as market leader, with 
a focus on all budgets, from £2.99 per 
square metre roll stock in our ‘Essentials’ 
range through to outstanding quality wool 
carpets from British manufacturers such 
as Westex, Brintons and Ulster.
We have identified an opportunity to create 
exclusives that allow for differentiation 
of Carpetright versus the independent 
sector and our national competitors. In 
this space the ‘House Beautiful Collection’ 
has been an outstanding success with 
the recent addition of a new velvet-
style polyamide twist. Exclusive ranges 
accounted for 3.2% of sales in the final 
quarter of the year, up from 1.9% in the 
comparable prior year period.

Chief Executive’s review continued
We will be launching a new collection 
of products under the popular and well 
recognised ‘Country Living’ brand before 
the end of 2017 in collaboration with this 
leading lifestyle magazine.
Our buying team has also begun to take 
a more creative and proactive approach 
to anticipating interiors fashion trends, 
with the introduction of more design-
led products that customers currently 
favour, including more bright colour 
options alongside blue, blush tones 
and dusty pastels.
In the UK, we began selling beds in 2009 
and the business has grown to represent 
9.2% of total sales, with beds being 
merchandised in 253 of our stores. Whilst 
we have delivered sales growth in the year, 
we believe a significant opportunity exists 
to grow this category faster. Through a 
programme of significant re-ranging and 
merchandising, supported by additional 
training, we are confident of delivering a 
step change in the sales contribution from 
the bed category, starting in the current 
financial year.
In the Netherlands and Belgium, we have 
re-introduced a range of curtains and 
blinds. This range is now available in 88 
stores and represented 4.7% of the total 
sales mix by the end of the financial year.
How we sell
As part of our plan to keep it simple, 
the performance of our store colleagues 
is measured on a small number of 
straightforward KPIs designed to increase 
the quality of the sale, both in terms of 
customer service and value. The success 
of this programme is demonstrated by our 
average transaction values, which grew by 
11% in the year. 
As a simple guide, where a store team 
delivers 15% or more interest free 
credit participation, 50% plus underlay 
penetration and 75% or more “highly 
satisfied” responses under ‘Do We 
Measure Up?’ surveys, they can, on 
average, expect to deliver like-for-like sales 
growth 3% ahead of the total UK estate.
As always, our biggest challenge is 
achieving consistency and narrowing 
variance between the very best 
performing stores and under-performing 
units. Customer service is central to this 
effort, to ensure we deliver an enviable 
reputation for service in what is, potentially, 
a lengthy customer journey with lots of 
moving parts. Our Net Promoter Score 
has improved significantly to 75% from 
71% across the year. As it stands, 96% 
of our customers are at least “satisfied”, 
as are 91% who experience our Home 
Flooring Surveyors and 85% of those who 
deal with recommended fitters. We remain 
focused on driving these metrics higher, 
particularly those in the latter area where 
we should be getting higher scores.
In simple terms, “highly satisfied” 
customers spend 3.4 times more on 
average and are significantly more likely 
to recommend Carpetright.
Across the Group, customer needs and 
technology changes are continuing to 
drive the need to deliver a fully integrated 
omnichannel shopping experience.  
We plan to invest in technology that 
enables our customers to interact with 
us throughout their buying journey on 
any device or physical outlet; uses 
information to make decisions easy 
for the customer; delivers a simple 
environment for our colleagues with 
the right tools; and establishes robust 
data security and controls.  In 2016, we 
invested in upgrading our store hardware 
and networks in the UK and are now 
extending this to the Netherlands and 
Belgium. We will also be implementing 
an integrated customer relationship 
management system in the UK within 
the next twelve months.
Where we sell
In Carpetright we have too many stores 
on too many unsustainable long leases 
that severely impact our overall profitability.  
We continue to address this challenge 
with vigour.
In the UK, the last twelve months was 
another year of progress as we opened 
eight stores, closed 17, including three 
relocations, to leave a total of 426 stores 
(2016: 435 stores). The new stores, 
opened in areas where we have long been 
under-represented, including Bath, Leeds 
and Liverpool, and have all delivered 
encouraging initial performances. As a 
result, we now trade from 3,691,000 sq ft 
of retail space in the UK (2016: 3,763,000 
sq ft), a 1.9% reduction year-on-year.
Our progress in the last five years on 
improving the quality of our UK store 
estate and reducing overall store numbers 
has been significant and we aim to have 
reduced the total to below 400 stores by 
this time next year. Where we close or 
downsize stores, we are almost always 
able to redeploy existing staff locally.
We continue to take a robust view at lease 
renewal, which provides the opportunity 
to secure lower rents for future years.  
Within the next five years 48% of the UK 
estate has a lease renewal scheduled, 
providing further opportunity to reduce 
the fixed store operating costs or to exit 
underperforming stores. As at April 2017, 
the average length of lease had fallen to 
5.5 years (2016: 6.3 years).
In the Rest of Europe, we opened 
six stores and closed five, including 
four relocations during the year, to 
leave a total of 138 stores (2016: 137 
stores). Consequently, we now trade 
from 1,360,000 sq ft of retail space 
(2016: 1,387,000 sq ft), a 2.0% 
reduction year-on-year. In line with 
the UK activity, discussions are being 
held with landlords in respect of lease 
renewals and this process is delivering 
rental reductions. The potential to 
secure reductions is generally dictated 
by the average length of lease remaining; 
with this being 2.8 years (2016: 2.6 
years) in the Netherlands and 1.8 years 
(2016: 2.3 years) in Belgium. In the 
Republic of Ireland this period is 8.1 years 
(2016: 9.1 years), reflecting the agreement 
of long-term deals during the expansion 
into this market in the period from 2001 
to 2008.
Our progress in this area is delivering 
an improvement in profitability. Whilst 
this activity can incur a cash cost to exit 
leases, either by assigning to new tenants 
or returning the property to landlords, 
by taking this robust approach we are 
confident we are getting an acceptable 
financial return.
12 | Annual report and accounts 2017 We are also acutely aware of the growing 
impact of digital on our business, both 
now and in the medium term. Sales, 
where the customer journey originated 
online, increased by 13.4% during the 
year, along with sample and appointment 
requests up around 20%. Over the past 
twelve months we have seen visits to the 
website increase by 14%, a reduction in 
our bounce rate due to improvements in 
the design, and pure online sales increase 
by 74%. Website revenue is now the 
equivalent of a top turnover store.
Initiatives delivered during the year include:
 – introducing the Carpetright ‘Visualiser’, 
giving the customer the opportunity to 
upload photos of their rooms and see 
how their choice of new floorcovering 
will enhance them by trying different 
product across our extensive ranges;
 – blogs designed to enhance consumer 
knowledge including decorating tips 
and trends with Diana Civil, a leading 
interior stylist;
 – practical videos on how to choose 
products, measure a room, stain 
removal and other tips to enhance 
our authority as market leaders in 
the sector;
 – online guide with Lucy Alexander as to 
how we make it “easy with every step”;
 – ability to book a visit with our Home 
Flooring Surveyors online; and
 – ability to pay for products online using 
interest free credit
Competition
The floorcoverings market in the UK 
has long been a highly competitive 
environment, with the Group facing 
competition from a vibrant independent 
sector and from a number of national and 
regional floorcoverings retailers. However, 
competition intensified significantly during 
the year when a new national competitor 
rolled out an aggressive store opening 
programme and a number of smaller 
players also began competing more 
actively at a local level.
Our strategy in response to competitor 
activity is simple and it applies in a variety 
of locations, specifically:
 – we refurbish our store with our new 
‘Graphite’ shop fit, effectively minimising 
the potential of any negative store 
environment factor;
 – we ensure the team are appropriately 
resourced for taking on the challenge of 
a new competitor; and
 – we introduce enhanced 
local promotions.
While this impacted our profit 
performance, we firmly believe that the 
cost to the business of failing to meet 
the competitive challenge would be 
considerably greater.
Significantly, while a new competitor 
inevitably steals some sales in the first year 
of operation, once we anniversary their 
store opening we are seeing like-for-like 
sales growth well ahead of the main 
estate. We believe that this encouraging 
performance demonstrates that the action 
we are taking is working.
Summary
Our primary external challenges over the 
past year were two-fold. First, the UK’s 
decision to exit the European Union on 
23 June 2016, saw Sterling depreciate 
dramatically against the Euro. Along with 
our competitors, this eventually made it 
necessary to raise some prices and we 
were able to mitigate this unexpected 
development in the second half of the year.
Second, as discussed above, a new 
entrant came to the market with an 
aggressive store opening programme, 
to which we are responding robustly.
Against this backdrop, we will not be 
diverted from our plan to transform the 
Carpetright business. The four main 
planks of our strategy remain valid and 
cover all elements of the customer 
journey as well as tackling our legacy 
property issues. Responding to intensified 
competition has sharpened us up and 
we are relishing the challenge in what 
may well become a more difficult trading 
environment, with ongoing uncertainty 
over consumer spending and inflationary 
pressures. We are confident that whatever 
the external environment we can increase 
our market share.
After a testing twelve months not lacking 
in excitement, I am grateful to the Board 
for their support and counsel and my 
thanks of course go to everyone in the 
store support offices in both Purfleet 
and Utrecht as well as our Regional and 
Divisional Managers across Europe.
My admiration for our store managers 
and sales colleagues who serve the 
customer day in, day out knows no 
bounds. Everyone in the store support 
offices does an ‘in-store day’ once a 
year, normally during the relatively quiet 
December period when we can cause 
least havoc. Whether our sales colleagues 
are in Edinburgh, Salford, Exeter, 
Rotterdam, Bruges or Cork, they are all 
doing a demanding job and I am grateful 
for their hard work and dedication.
Our ongoing change of culture is still 
very much in the early stages but the 
way we train, communicate and reward 
our frontline staff remains a key priority 
in making sure we are the first choice for 
the floorcoverings consumer, every time.
We are Carpetright.
