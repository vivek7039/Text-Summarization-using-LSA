STRATEGIC REPORT – OVERVIEW
Chairman’s Statement 
*
Gary Kennedy
Progress on  
many fronts
The acquisition of Peacock Foods in the US and investments  
in the UK have transformed Greencore in what has been  
a demanding year.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
FY17 has been both a challenging and 
rewarding year. We made our largest 
acquisition ever in the US and have step-
changed our UK business through organic 
growth. There were some challenges in 
delivering a programme of such complexity, 
with an impact on operating leverage in the 
period and with considerable investment  
and restructuring charges incurred. However, 
as a result of the significant activity delivered 
in the year, we are now well positioned to 
secure profitable growth and returns in the 
coming years. 
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT
In FY17 we made further progress in  
achieving our vision to become a fast-growing, 
international convenience food leader. This 
vision and our strategy shape the direction  
of the Group. A complete outline of our 
strategic framework is provided on pages  
13 to 17, with examples of how this was 
implemented in FY17 and the priorities in 
place for FY18.
The key highlight of the year was the 
completion of the acquisition of Peacock 
Foods on 30 December 2016. The acquisition 
transforms our market and channel position  
in the US and has given us a growth platform 
of real scale. The enlarged US business has a 
well invested network, serving a diversified 
customer base across multiple channels. 
Integration is on track and the focus is on 
exploiting the potential of the commercial 
pipeline of outsourcing and innovation-led 
opportunities. 
*    The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures 
(‘APMs’) which are non-IFRS measures to monitor the 
performance of its operations and of the Group as a 
whole. These APMs along with their definitions and 
reconciliations to IFRS measures are provided in the 
APMs section on pages 176 to 179.  5 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
In the UK we strengthened our leadership 
position in the food to go category with several 
significant business wins and commercial 
launches delivered to plan, and contracts 
extended with core customers. We have 
completed a phase of network investment in 
Food to Go, and have added further capacity 
through the acquisition of the Heathrow 
facility. We have also made a substantial 
investment in the UK ready meals network,  
and have rationalised the UK portfolio with the 
planned exit from the desserts manufacturing 
business in Evercreech. Finally, we have begun 
a process of streamlining our UK organisation 
which will help underpin overall performance  
in the medium term. 
BREXIT
Although the exact nature of changes to  
come as a result of Brexit remains unclear,  
the Board continue to monitor closely its 
potential implications on the business, 
including, in particular, any potential changes 
to costs in the supply chain and the availability 
and cost of labour.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
We assess financial performance across  
the Group using a framework of profitability, 
return and cash flow measures. This framework 
underpins our financial Key Performance 
Indicators (pages 20 and 21) and our criteria 
for remuneration (pages 63 to 93).
Performance in the year has been challenging 
at times, reflecting the significant operational 
investments and strategic change in the period. 
Reported revenue in the year was £2,319.7m, 
an increase of 56.5% versus FY16, and 
Adjusted Operating Profit grew by 37.4%  
to £140.1m, both primarily driven by the 
acquisition of Peacock Foods. Adjusted 
Operating Margin was 6.0%, 90 basis points 
below the prior year, primarily due to the 
impact of the acquisition of Peacock Foods 
and the significant commercial investments  
in the UK. Adjusted EPS declined by 3.8%  
to 15.4p reflecting the increase in Adjusted 
Operating Profit, offset by a higher tax rate,  
a higher finance charge and the impact of an 
increased number of shares as a result of the 
rights issue which part funded the Peacock 
Foods acquisition. Basic EPS declined by 
80.0% to 1.9p. This was because the Group 
incurred a pre-tax exceptional charge of 
£78.2m in the period. This amount was higher 
than we would have liked, in particular the 
£29.7m impairment charge for software assets. 
This related to our decision not to proceed 
with the planned rollout of a common Enterprise 
Resource Planning (‘ERP’) platform across the 
UK business. Whilst I believe this decision is 
necessary, the impairment is nonetheless 
unsatisfactory. 
I have been pleased with the increased focus 
on cash flow and returns. This will be a theme 
for the business in FY18 and beyond. 
DIVIDENDS
The Board of Directors is recommending  
a final dividend of 3.37 pence per share.  
This will result in a total dividend for the year  
of 5.47 pence per share (FY16: 5.47 pence per 
share). The total dividend represents a pay-out 
amount of approximately 38% of Adjusted 
Earnings, in line with the policy to maintain  
an annual dividend pay-out equivalent to 
30–40% of Adjusted Earnings. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In line with the above developments in  
FY17 , we continued to develop our corporate 
governance practices. We have made progress 
in strengthening our corporate culture and 
corporate governance framework, increasing 
the transparency of our remuneration 
structures and improving our engagement  
with shareholders. I recognise this is an 
important and constantly evolving process. 
One of the Board’s top priorities was to absorb 
the lessons from the large number of votes 
against two remuneration-based resolutions 
at the Annual General Meeting in January 2017 . 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee 
Chair and I engaged with our largest 
shareholders on the future developments  
in relation to our remuneration approach.  
I found the shareholder engagement very 
valuable in trying to understand the range of 
perspectives on our remuneration and I would 
like to thank our shareholders for their input. 
The Remuneration Committee having viewed 
shareholder feedback holistically, made detailed 
proposals to the Board which have all been 
adopted and are presented in the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration on pages 63 to 93. 
The acquisition of Peacock Foods in the US 
and importance of that geography to the 
Group has led to some governance changes. 
We have created a Group US Advisory Council 
to help inform us on market, commercial  
and regulatory matters. We have co-opted 
Tom Sampson, previously CEO of Peacock 
Foods and Kevin O’Malley, recently retired US 
Ambassador to Ireland, to the Board. Both are 
US residents and I warmly welcome them to 
the Group. Tom will also chair the Group’s US 
Advisory Council.
As part of our ongoing planned Board 
development Eric Nicoli, who was appointed 
as Non-Executive Director in May 2010 will 
retire after the December Board meeting.  
I would like to thank Eric for his outstanding 
service and contribution to the Group and  
his valuable personal counsel to myself over 
the past seven years in Greencore. In addition 
to being the Senior Independent Director, Eric 
was a member of the Nomination Committee 
and previously chaired the Remuneration 
Committee. Upon his retirement, Sly Bailey  
will take over the role as Senior Independent 
Director. 
CULTURE AND VALUES
FY17 was a demanding year for our employees 
especially as we progressed to transform the 
UK and the US business. Throughout our 
operations, regardless of geography, The 
Greencore Way continues to drive our culture 
and our values. Through my visits to the sites 
during the year, I witnessed the commitment 
and input of all of our employees and I want to 
take this opportunity to thank all our employees 
for their dedication and hard work throughout 
the year. I am particularly impressed by the  
way our new employees have integrated and 
strengthened our capabilities in many areas. 
OUTLOOK
Greencore anticipates delivering a year of 
strong growth in FY18 and is well positioned  
to drive improved profitability, cash flow and 
returns over the medium term. Building on 
what has been an intense phase of strategic 
progress and network investment, Greencore 
will now take advantage of its exposure to 
higher growth categories in the UK and US 
convenience food markets. 
The Group anticipates good revenue growth 
in FY18, driven by a full-year contribution from 
Peacock Foods and organic growth in both the 
UK and the US. Further new business wins are 
expected in the US, the financial impact of 
which will be determined by the phasing of 
commercial execution. The Group anticipates 
that the UK business will see a modest 
improvement in operating leverage despite 
continued inflationary pressures, and that the 
US division will benefit from the delivery of 
further cost synergies. The rate of EPS growth 
is expected to be moderated by an increasing 
tax rate. The Group also anticipates that by  
the end of the year it will be approaching its 
benchmark leverage ratio of approximately  
2x Net Debt to EBITDA.
