WORLD-CLASS 
TECHNOLOGY
Our offer allows advertisers to reach viewers when they’re 
emotionally engaged by embedding brand messaging in relevant 
premium content. It’s a new, easy‑to‑plan ad solution for reaching 
large target audiences, and one that cannot be skipped or blocked.
We use computer‑vision algorithms 
to automatically track and analyse 
video, and our algorithms use 
machine‑learning techniques to 
automatically suggest ad locations.
