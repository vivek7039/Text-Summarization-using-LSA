Lamprell’s yards are situated in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, 
which is a prime location for accessing the major oil & gas 
markets in the Middle East and other parts of the globe. We 
have modern quayside facilities ensuring safe and efficient load 
out of our projects onto vessels for onward transportation to our 
international client base.
Our smaller business  
units, O&M and Sunbelt  
Safety Services, provide 
technically advanced 
services within our sectors 
including specialist welding 
and fabrication as well as 
gas detection monitoring 
and equipment. Both bring 
Lamprell’s strong safety and 
quality culture wherever they 
operate.

Note: The way we view the business going forward has changed in line with our 
strategic objectives; see 8 and Note 36 for further details on this. Macro-economic factors and strategy 
In 2017 energy prices were significantly 
less volatile than in 2016, when they  
hit ten-year lows, with Brent crude oil 
rising through a range of USD 47-67/
bbl1. The recovery in oil prices has been 
driven by OPEC and non-OPEC countries, 
mainly Russia, first agreeing to and then 
extending their production cuts at the  
end of 20171, which also supported  
a strong year-end finish in the oil price. 
In addition to production cuts, IOCs 
continue to invest selectively with typical 
projects being sanctioned on the basis of 
an oil price of USD 60/bbl2 or less which 
further supports energy prices. However , 
North American shale capacity and the 
ability to ramp up production quickly acts 
as a natural brake to significant price 
increases and this dynamic between 
shale and OPEC’s self-imposed cuts is 
expected to continue throughout 2018. 
Within the Middle East, NOC investment 
is driven more by considerations related 
to market share and funding government 
budgets, and investment in the region is 
expected to continue or even grow from 
recent years
3,4
.  
While the traditional oil industry faces 
some uncertainty, the renewables industry 
continues to develop rapidly and attract 
investment, especially in the offshore 
wind environment which is Lamprell’s 
area of focus in this growing market. 
The known global portfolio of offshore 
wind has the potential to deliver 92GW, 
with circa 75GW still to be awarded and 
built. Europe leads the way globally, with 
the UK and Germany by far the largest 
participants to date in this market5.  
The offshore wind industry is undergoing 
a fundamental shift from an industry that 
needs subsidies to attract investment, 
to one that is commercial and attracts 
investment in its own right. The 2017 UK 
Contract for Difference (CfD) Round 2 
auction delivered a strike price of  
£57.50/MWh for two wind farms, some 
50% below that achieved two years 
earlier6, and these cost reductions are 
expected to continue through technology 
innovation, economies of scale and 
higher project volumes7. As offshore wind 
power reaches parity with traditional 
power generation, and with some national 
governments setting policy to eliminate 
petrol and diesel cars from the roads in 
the next decades8, the future of offshore 
wind as a source of abundant green 
energy appears assured and is a long-
term market opportunity for Lamprell. 
Strategic report
Markets, pipeline and opportunities
04
The medium-term forecast for the global energy industry is predicting 
modest growth. Bidding in our traditional oil & gas market remains key 
to our business but is highly competitive due to limited project flows. 
Conversely, the renewables sector is developing rapidly and offers us 
an opportunity to diversify .

Market sectors and our opportunities
Renewables
The discipline shown by IOCs over the last few years has meant 
a significant drop in annual spend on capital projects, with some 
IOCs reporting reductions of 35% from 20131, and this continues 
to translate into reduced project flow into the supply chain for 
contractors such as Lamprell. With oil prices expected to be 
relatively flat over the near future within our oil & gas market, 
activity is mainly focused on the shallow water and shelf projects 
in the Middle East, UK and Norwegian sea sectors where 
projects are proceeding. 
In 2017 Saudi Aramco awarded nearly USD 3 billion worth of 
shallow water EPC(I) projects2 to support offshore oil production. 
They have also committed to continue additional investment  
in the Arabian Gulf to increase their offshore production and 
in the Red Sea to progress offshore development in 2018 
and beyond. Lamprell is well positioned in Saudi Arabia to 
take advantage of this through our investment with our newly 
inaugurated International Maritime Industries (“IMI”) marine  
yard joint venture with Saudi Aramco, Bahri and Hyundai  
Heavy Industries. We also see opportunities in the UAE where 
ADNOC has recently committed significant capital spending  
in its onshore and offshore oil & gas programmes3. Being a  
UAE-based company with a long history of working and 
delivering to ADNOC, Lamprell is well placed to participate  
in this next wave of investment in the UAE.
In the Norwegian and Barents Sea, Statoil is progressing with  
its major field developments at Castberg and Johan Sverdrup 
Phase 2, recently awarding several EPC(I) packages3. In 
addition, other field developers such as AkerBP , OMV and Lundin 
are moving towards final investment decisions in 2018 and 2019  
on various Barents Sea projects. With Lamprell’s history of 
delivering projects in the North Sea, we are making use of our 
cost-effective, safe and high-quality offering as the basis for 
selectively bidding work in the region.
Oil & gas
The renewables offshore wind market has gathered pace over 
the past 12 months with a large number of new enquiries 
received as a result of Lamprell’s proactive marketing efforts in 
this area, in line with our strategic objectives. The main driver is 
the improving economics of wind farms due to the economies of 
scale and technological advancements across the supply chain. 
Up until recently, government subsidies were a political barrier 
to projects reaching sanction, and while they are still in place in 
the latest round of UK awards, they represent a fraction of those 
seen in earlier projects. As subsidies are expected to decrease 
or be eliminated in the medium term, we anticipate a continued 
high volume of enquiries and a more traditional bid cycle where 
timelines are less drawn-out. We also expect less governmental 
involvement, consistent with its role in the oil & gas industry . 
Within the offshore wind market, Lamprell is pursuing options 
across three areas of supply: (i) providing foundations for the 
wind farm turbines similar to those on our current East Anglia 
One project for Scottish Power Renewables; (ii) delivering HVAC 
and HVDC substations leveraging our offshore experience in the 
North Sea; and (iii) constructing Wind Turbine Installation Vessels 
(“WTIV”) consistent with our significant experience building such 
vessels for the likes of Seajacks and Fred Olsen. For foundations, 
we are only pursuing jacket-based projects where our fabrication 
expertise is a differentiator . As wind turbines are expected to get 
larger , and wind farms expected to migrate into deeper water 
offshore, jacket-based projects will predominate over monopiles. 
We have a number of enquiries in hand for jacket foundations 
and substations, predominantly focused in the European market. 
For WTIVs, vessel owners are positioning for the next generation 
of turbine installation, with turbines evolving from 8 MW to larger 
10, 12 or even 15 MW turbines4 although capital investment in 
larger and more costly vessels (which would be required for 
larger turbines) is unlikely to proceed without commitments from 
offshore developers. Lamprell’s approach is, therefore, to focus 
on foundations and substations and to take a more selective view 
of projects to construct WTIVs.
