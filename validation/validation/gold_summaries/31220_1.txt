Annual Report 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
With the financing for the
equipment almost in place the
Company will be ready to move
to the next phase of its
development plan.”
Overview
The Company is very close to securing the
finance to purchase the equipment necessary
to increase the output from its current levels to
its initial target of 40,000t a month, moving to
70,000t in 2019.
Infrastructure enhancements and progress of
the underground decline have been continuing
in the year. This will provide a good
springboard for increasing the output once the
available equipment is in situ.
In terms of expected timelines the production is
planned to increase from Q3 2018, once the
equipment is commissioned and delivered.
Current developments
The following progress was achieved in developing
the underground mine in the year:
 Development of the decline was taken down to
150masl, this gave access to ore bodies 10, 3-8
and ore body 5. There is no further requirement
in the short term to develop the decline as this
together with the original decline giving access
to ore body 11, will provide sufficient mineable
ore for the current planned production.
 Ore bodies have continued to be prepared for
production however the lack of equipment has
been a hindrance in this regard. In addition it
has been difficult to target the ore bodies in a
precise manner in order to extract the grade of
ore as indicated by the exploration drilling,
resulting in a higher than expected dilution in
the grade.
 The actual overall processing grade achieved in
the FY17 was 1.89 g/t (2016: 1.66g/t). As
explained this was due to two factors a dilution
issue and because lower grade ore stockpiled
ore was mixed with the higher-grade ore to
maintain operational efficiency in the processing
plant. In the year the Company did not have the
necessary equipment for contouring and drilling
the ore bodies in order to maximise the
extraction of the higher grade ore without
dilution. The underground ore grade fell to
2.08g/t from 2.70g/t in 2016. The expectation is
that these issues will be settled once the new
equipment is in place.
 Refurbishment of the processing plant and the
preparation of the ore bodies together with the
completion of tailings dam 4 in early 2017, now
allows for the rapid increase in production once
the equipment is in situ expected to be in Q3
2018. The tailings dam will provide sufficient
storage for at least three years.
 During the year the company purchased a LHD
Fambition (load-haul-dumper used to fill the
underground trucks with ore), and a prospect
drilling machine, CSK Sondaj – C400 (used to
define and contour the ore bodies to target and
extract the higher-grade ores). 
 In addition, the costs of exploration at
Karasuyskoye were capitalised in accordance
with the accounting policy this amounted
approximately US$1.4m, (475mKzt), which was
principally invoiced by third party consultants to
conduct detailed geological testing, and project
documentation.
