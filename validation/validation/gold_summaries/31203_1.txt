“ 2017 was a year of delivery with significant organic loan book growth whilst 
impairment reduced from 29% to 24% of normalised revenue. I am pleased to 
say that these trends have continued into the current year. With strong market 
positions in each of our chosen segments, a clear plan for growth and long-
term funding in place, we remain confident in the full year outlook and are 
pleased to recommend a final dividend of 1.70p per share making 2.20p for the 
year as a whole (2016: 1.2p), an increase of 83% over the prior year.”

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
These achievements contributed to strong 
loan book growth in all three divisions and 
the combined net loan book at 
31 December 2017 increased by 51% to 
£247.9m, before fair value adjustments 
(2016: £164.6m) and to £259.8m (2016: 
£180.4m) after fair value adjustments. 
Adjusting for the acquisition of George 
Banco, the year-on-year increase in the net 
loan book before fair value adjustments 
was 30% (2016: £191.4m). A summary of the 
key performance indicators for each of our 
businesses is shown on the previous page.
This strong growth increased normalised 
revenue by 48% to £119.8m (2016: £81.1m) 
and normalised operating profit, before 
£3.2m of temporary additional commission 
at Loans at Home, increased by 72%  
to £26.9m (2016: £15.6m). Normalised 
operating profit after these costs increased 
by 71% to £23.7m (2016: £13.8m) and 
normalised earnings per share increased 
by 31% to 3.44p (2016: 2.62p). Adjusting  
for the one-off nature of the temporary 
additional commission, normalised 
earnings per share was 4.25p (2016: 3.09p). 
The Group’s 2017 reported, or statutory 
results are significantly affected by the 
acquisition of George Banco, the full year 
impact of the April 2016 acquisition of 
Everyday Loans (including TrustTwo), fair 
value adjustments and the amortisation of 
acquired intangibles. 
Reported revenue after fair value 
adjustments, was up 48% to £107.8m (2016: 
£72.8m) while the sale of a non-performing 
loan portfolio generated other operating 
income of £1.9m (2016: £0.5m). A 40% 
increase in administration costs to £77.1m 
(2016: £54.8m) included £3.2m of temporary 
additional commission and £2.1m of other 
Loans at Home related expansion costs. 
Finance costs increased due to strong loan 
book growth and the impact of the Group’s 
new financing arrangements (see below) 
while exceptional items totalled £6.3m 
(2016: £0.6m) primarily reflecting the 
write-off of previously capitalised fees 
associated with prior period debt raising. 
The net result was that the Group delivered 
a reported loss before tax of £13.0m (2016: 
loss of £9.3m) and a reported loss per share 
of 3.26p (2016: loss per share of 2.60p).
Reflecting our confidence in the outlook, 
the Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 1.70p making a total of 2.20p for the year 
(2016:1.2p). This represents a 50% payout 
ratio based on adjusted normalised 
earnings per share (before £3.2m of Loans 
at Home temporary additional commission) 
of 4.25p.
Acquisition of 
George Banco
Branch-based lending
Our largest business, Everyday Loans, 
delivered an outstanding performance with 
a particularly strong second half driven by 
increased loan volumes, higher yield and 
lower impairment. The change of pace and 
ambition was led by a revitalised senior 
management team under the stewardship 
of Miles Cresswell-Turner who took over the 
leadership of the business in May 2017. 
Normalised operating profit (before fair 
value adjustments, amortisation of 
acquired intangibles and exceptional items) 
was up 53% to £22.7m (2016 £14.8m). 
Contributing to this strong growth was the 
expansion of our branch network with 12 
new branches opened during the year and 
each new branch performing as expected. 
As a result, there were 53 branches open at 
the end of 2017, a 47% increase since we 
acquired the business in April 2016. We also 
extended our product range in 2017 with 
the launch of the ‘Selfy’ loan, a tailored 
product for self-employed customers, as 
well as a new 12-month loan that is 
particularly suited to new customers. 
Home credit
Davie Thompson was promoted to CEO of 
Loans at Home in January 2017 and has 
overseen a transformational period for the 
business. Our plan for growth was 
accelerated by the announcement of a 
major restructuring by the market leader in 
February 2017. This resulted in us being 
approached by large numbers of self-
employed agents and management staff 
that were keen to join Loans at Home. By 
31 December 2017 we had added over 440 
experienced self-employed agents as well 
as over 100 staff to our business; we had also 
opened 22 new offices. While there was an 
associated investment of £5.3m (comprising 
£3.2m of Loans at Home temporary 
additional commission and £2.1m of other 
expansion related costs), the collections  
and lending performance of the new agents 
has been particularly strong and helped to 
drive a 53% increase in the loan book, a 
reduction in the rate of impairment and an 
11% increase in the number of customers. 
Before temporary additional commission, 
normalised operating profit was up 73% to 
£6.3m (2016: £3.6m); after deducting these 
costs, normalised operating profit was up 
67% to £3.1m (2016: £1.9m). 
£30m net loan book
Having issued its first loan in 2014, 
George Banco grew quickly by 
leveraging its strong broker 
relationships and had a £30m loan 
book on acquisition.
NSF now clear #2  
in guarantor loans
Our guarantor loans division now has a 
loan book of £48.2m, up 35% versus the 
prior year on a pro forma basis.
Earnings enhancing  
in first full year
The acquisition remains on-track to 
deliver incremental earnings in 2018.
Strong growth potential
The UK’s guarantor loans market is 
growing strongly and we intend to 
increase our market share. Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 26
Group Chief Executive’s report continued
Guarantor loans
The Group acquired George Banco on 
17 August 2017 to become the clear number 
two in the UK guarantor loans market. 
Under the leadership of Marc Howells, the 
CEO of George Banco, our Guarantor 
Loans Division enjoyed strong loan book 
growth in 2017, up 35% on a like-for-like 
basis. This helped to drive normalised 
operating profit that increased by 497% to 
£2.7m (2016: £0.5m).
Strategy
We provide unsecured credit to the 10-12 
million UK consumers who are unable or 
unwilling to borrow from mainstream 
institutions, either because they are on low 
or variable earnings, are credit impaired, 
have a thin credit file or have had an 
unsatisfactory experience of borrowing 
from mainstream lenders. With a net loan 
book of almost £250m (before fair value 
adjustments) and almost 169,000 customers 
at the end of December 2017, we represent 
an important source of credit for 
consumers, credit that many other lenders 
are not prepared to provide but which 
plays a meaningful part in helping to drive 
the UK economy.
Where we differ from many of our 
competitors is that when lending direct, in 
addition to conducting a digital credit 
check, we also aim to meet potential 
customers face-to-face. Whilst an 
expensive model to operate, this represents 
an important part of our underwriting 
process and helps us to better understand 
the customer’s circumstances and make 
better lending decisions. Having delivered 
annual loan book growth of more than 20% 
in 2017, we remain focused on reaching our 
second target of a 20% return on assets in 
each of our operating businesses. 
This will be achieved through the continued 
execution of our business strategy that 
comprises the following three elements:
1. Being a leader in each of our chosen 
business segments 
We subscribe to the view that leadership  
is a key driver of long-term success and  
are well-placed in all three areas of  
our business:
• Branch-based lending – Everyday Loans 
is the clear market leader in unsecured 
branch-based lending to the credit 
impaired with 47,000 customers. 
• Home credit – Loans at Home is ranked 
third in the market having grown 
strongly with over 104,000 customers in 
2017.
• Guarantor loans – Following the 
acquisition of George Banco, we are 
now the clear number two in the market 
with a loan book of close to £50m and 
over 17,000 customers. 
2. Investing in our core assets
Through suitable investment in people, our 
distribution networks, technology and 
brands, we are increasing our capacity to 
drive further loan book growth whilst at the 
same time managing operational risks 
through effective spans of control. 
People – establishing a good relationship 
with our customers through face-to-face 
contact is at the heart of our business 
model and in 2017 we increased the size of 
our workforce by 40% to over 750 full time 
employees. We also launched a sharesave 
scheme for all staff so they can participate 
in the future success of the Group. In home 
credit, we recruited over 440 experienced 
self-employed agents taking our total 
number to over 1,000. Such expansion 
required significant investment in training 
and incentives that are focused on 
rewarding both financial results and the 
delivery of good customer outcomes. 
Distribution networks – we opened 12 new 
Everyday Loans branches in 2017 taking the 
total number now open to 53 – we plan to 
open a further 12 in the first half of 2018. 
At Loans at Home we opened 22 new 
offices to support the rapid expansion of 
our self-employed agent network and we 
now have 69 locations (including the head 
office) across the UK. 
Technology – while face-to-face contact 
lies at the heart of both branch-based 
lending and home credit, all three of our 
business divisions rely heavily on 24/7 
access to scalable and robust technology. 
With thousands of customers up and down 
the country, effective data management 
and analysis ensures that we can process 
large volumes of transactions, conduct full 
credit scoring and lead management and 
can monitor and optimise our day-to-day 
business performance. 
Brands – securing the trust and confidence 
of our customers and other key stakeholders 
is vitally important, especially now that 
purchase decisions for financial services 
are increasingly made online or through 
remote channels. The quality of our service 
and size of our customer base means that 
continuing to invest in our brands and 
reputation is a source of substantial 
long-term value for the Group. 
3. Acting responsibly
As noted in the Chairman’s Statement on 
pages 4 to 5, how we behave as a 
business is not just defined by prevailing 
laws or regulations but also by our culture 
or ‘how we do things around here’. Right at 
the outset and at the very heart of our 
long-term strategic plan was the vision 
that Non-Standard Finance plc would 
represent the very best in consumer credit, 
with the highest standards of compliance 
and best practice. 
We monitor closely how our behaviour and 
conduct might impact our key stakeholders, 
whether they be customers, staff, self-
employed agents, suppliers, our 
environment or the communities where  
we have a physical presence. Through a 
number of initiatives across the Group, 
including a series of employee workshops, 
we have identified a number of core 
behaviours that we see as being vital if  
we are to achieve our strategic goals:
• Doing the right thing: we recognise our 
collective responsibility for delivering 
great outcomes for our customers,  
even when others are not looking.
• Integrity: we respect colleagues and 
other key stakeholders and always do 
what we say we will do. Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 27
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
• Shared purpose delivered through 
teamwork: we have clear goals and 
expect all of our people to share in that 
vision. By working together we are likely 
to solve problems more effectively than 
trying to do things on our own. 
• Clear communication: we are well-
informed and listen carefully to those 
dealing direct with our customers;  
we also speak up when something  
is not right; we celebrate success and 
don’t blame others when something 
goes wrong, always learning from  
our mistakes.
• Entrepreneurial leadership: we lead by 
example and use our initiative, trying 
new things so we can improve.
By embedding each of these into our 
employee review protocol we aim to 
formalise the process by which we 
recognise and reward these values and 
behaviours so that we can stand out from 
our competitors. 
Financing
On 3 August 2017 we announced the 
acquisition of George Banco, the number 
two provider of guarantor loans in the 
non-standard sector, for £18.6m 
(representing an enterprise value of 
£53.5m). To finance the acquisition and 
refinance all of the Group’s existing debt 
facilities, as well as to provide additional 
funding to support future growth, we 
secured a new £175m term loan facility (the 
‘Term Loan’), provided by a group of 
institutional investors, led by Alcentra 
Limited. The new six-year loan bears an 
interest rate of LIBOR plus 7.25% per year 
with interest payable every six months. The 
same investors also agreed to provide an 
additional committed facility of up to £50m 
under the same terms as the Term Loan 
taking their total commitment to the Group 
to £225m. In addition, the Group secured a 
new £35m revolving credit facility provided 
by Royal Bank of Scotland at an interest 
rate of LIBOR plus 3.5% per year. 
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had cash 
at bank of £11.0m (2016: £5.2m) and gross 
borrowings of £208.1m (2016: £87.3m) 
leaving total headroom on the Group’s debt 
facilities of £51.9m (2016: £12.9m). 
Regulation
With each of our three business divisions 
now fully authorised by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (‘FCA’), we believe we 
have established a constructive dialogue 
with the regulator at both an operational 
as well as at a more strategic level. 
The FCA published a number of documents 
regarding consumer credit in 2017 and 
while there appear to be no concerns 
regarding branch-based lending or 
guarantor loans, through its ongoing review 
of high-cost credit, the FCA is continuing to 
improve its understanding of certain 
segments, including home credit. 
Through our regular interactions with the 
FCA, as well as through formal consultations, 
we continue to inform the FCA’s understanding 
around home credit and its importance to 
over a million UK consumers.
In its response to ‘Good work: the Taylor 
Review of modern working practices’, the 
Government announced in February 2018 
its intention to consult widely on a variety  
of matters affecting the UK workforce, 
including employment status. With a 
network of over 1,000 self-employed 
agents, the majority of whom are women, 
we are monitoring these developments 
closely and will be contributing to the 
consultations in due course. 
A summary of some of the recent regulatory 
developments that may have a bearing  
on the Group’s business is set out in ‘An 
evolving regulatory landscape’ on page 28.
Final dividend
Having declared a half-year dividend of 
0.5p per share in August 2017 (2016: 0.3p), 
the Board is pleased to recommend a final 
dividend of 1.70p per share (2016: 0.9p), 
making a total of 2.20p for the year as a 
whole (2016: 1.2p). If approved by 
shareholders, based on normalised 
post-tax earnings before temporary agent 
commission, this would mean that we had 
exceeded our medium-term target of a 
payout ratio of 50%. 
If approved at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting on 14 May 2018, the final 
dividend would be paid to those 
shareholders on the Company’s share 
register on 18 May 2018 (the ‘Record Date’), 
with payment being made on 15 June 2018.
Current trading and outlook
We have made a good start to the year 
with each of our business divisions 
continuing to deliver strong loan book 
growth whilst maintaining tight control on 
impairment. We therefore remain confident 
about the Group’s full year prospects.

An evolving regulatory 
landscape
During 2017/18 there were a number of 
regulatory developments that may have 
a bearing on the Group’s activities and 
business operations in the future. Some 
of the more pertinent developments are 
summarised below.
January 2017
• The FCA published its final guidance on 
how consumer credit firms should address 
the matter of default notices in respect of 
guarantor loans. This was a revision to 
previous guidance having taken into 
account a number of responses made. 
 February 2017
• The FCA closed its call for input into 
high-cost credit on 15 February 2017 . The 
review covered the payday lending cap, 
unauthorised overdrafts as well as a 
broader review of all forms of high-cost 
credit, including home-collected credit. 
April 2017
• The FCA published its Mission, Sector 
Views and Business Plan for 2017 . Each 
provides a valuable insight into the views, 
objectives and operating parameters 
adopted by the FCA in carrying out its 
duties. They also refer to some of the 
thematic reviews that the FCA expects to 
undertake in the future.
• The FCA published a consultation on its 
proposed measures to address persistent 
credit card debt and to require credit card 
firms to use their data to identify customers 
at risk of financial difficulties.
June 2017
• The FCA published its impact assessment 
on the amendments to the guarantor 
lending rules pursuant to PS15/23.
July 2017
• The FCA published its feedback statement 
following its call for input into high-cost 
credit and also issued a consultation into 
creditworthiness and affordability in 
consumer credit. 
• The FCA published ‘Occasional Paper 
No.28 – Preventing financial distress by 
predicting unaffordable consumer credit 
agreements: An applied framework’. 
Much of this research was used to support 
proposals in the creditworthiness and 
affordability consultation also issued on 
31 July 2017 (see above).
• The Taylor Review of Modern Working 
Practices was published, making  
a number of recommendations to 
government regarding the definition  
of workers and the principles which 
workers and employers should be 
expected to adopt. 
July 2017 continued
• The FCA published a consultation on staff 
incentives, remuneration and performance 
management in consumer credit. The 
review aims to help firms identify practices 
that may promote inappropriate behaviour 
by company representatives that in turn 
could result in poor customer outcomes.
• The Financial Guidance and Claims Bill, 
that creates the framework for a single 
financial guidance body, was introduced in 
the Queen’s speech and had its second 
reading in the House of Lords.
September 2017
• The FCA published an occasional paper on 
the ageing population and financial 
services including the FCA’s strategy for 
mitigating the potential harm arising.
October 2017
• HM Treasury launched a call for evidence to 
gain further insight from the debt advice 
sector and creditors about how best to 
design, implement, administer and monitor 
a six-week breathing space scheme and 
statutory debt management plan.
• The FCA published ‘Understanding the 
financial lives of UK adults – Findings from 
the FCA’s Financial Lives Survey 2017’, an 
extensive piece of research into how 
different segments of the UK population 
interact with regulated financial services. 
Based on nearly 13,000 face-to-face and 
online interviews, Financial Lives is the 
FCA’s largest tracking survey on consumers 
and finance.
November 2017
• The FCA published their findings on illegal 
lending in the UK in a paper titled: ‘Shining 
a light on illegal money lending: consumer 
experiences of unauthorised lending in  
the UK.’
• The FCA published a document detailing its 
approach to consumers which is intended to 
broaden the debate started in its Mission 
(published on 18 April 2017) by exploring its 
approach to regulating for retail consumers.
• The Information Commissioner’s Office 
published its updated guide to the General 
Data Protection Regulation which is due  
to come into force on 25 May 2018 including 
guidance on contracts and liabilities  
as between data controller and data 
processors and on obtaining, recording  
and managing consents.
December 2017
• The FCA published a document detailing 
its approach to promoting competition in 
the interests of consumers and not for its 
own sake. The FCA is focused on keeping 
markets open to entry and innovation, 
tackling anti-competitive conduct and 
intervening to ensure competitive forces 
drive good outcomes for consumers.
• The FCA published a document explaining 
the purpose of, and its approach to, 
authorisation, the public value it delivers 
and changes the FCA is making to improve

harm from occurring, by ensuring that all 
regulated firms and individuals meet 
common sets of minimum standards.
January 2018

on the High-Cost Credit Review and 
thoughts on the direction of travel, with 
indications on the further work it is 
undertaking and the planned timelines for 
that work.
February 2018 
• The Government published its response to 
the Taylor Review on Modern Working 
Practices (see above). At the same time, the 
Government launched four consultations 
on the following key areas: employment 
status; increasing transparency in the 
labour market; agency workers; and 
enforcement of employment rights. The 
consultations close on various dates in  
May and June 2018.
• The Financial Guidance and Claims Bill, 
that creates the framework for a single 
financial guidance body, completed the 
Committee Stage in Parliament and is 
expected to enter the Report Stage in the 
House of Commons in due course.
