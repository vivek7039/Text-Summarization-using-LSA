Introduction
It is a pleasure to introduce Nanoco’s results for 
the year to 31 July 2017. This has been a challenging 
year, with slower than anticipated adoption of the 
Company’s cadmium-free quantum dots (“CFQDs”) 
in the display industry. However, significant progress 
has been made in developing demand for our 
CFQDs; an increasing number of manufacturers are 
now producing demonstration displays incorporating 
our technology and we are confident that sales will 
result as these move into commercial production. 
We are also making good progress in Life sciences 
and Specialised lighting. The slower than expected 
progress in Display and the Company’s funding 
horizon have both had a detrimental impact on 
the Company’s share price. I am pleased to say 
that the recent announcement of an equity 
placing has alleviated liquidity concerns.

Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Following the change in commercial strategy in 
the previous financial year, substantial changes 
were made in the business during this year, which 
have created the building blocks for future commercial 
success. The Company has a compelling go-to-market 
strategy, with a partnership with Taiwan’s Wah Hong 
Industrial Corporation (“Wah Hong”), alongside its 
two licensees, The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) 
and Merck KGaA (“Merck”). These routes to market 
are supported by the Company’s own manufacturing 
facility in Runcorn. We now have the supply chain 
and the technology to support the development of 
the emerging market in CFQDs for the display industry. 
The recent move by the European Commission to ban 
cadmium in displays in Europe from 31 October 2019 
is helping to accelerate adoption of the technology and 
the demonstration by major television manufacturers 
of displays featuring Nanoco’s CFQDs is further 
evidence of this adoption. 
While our focus in 2017 has been on the display 
market, Nanoco’s technology has several important 
applications beyond that sector. Important progress 
was made during 2017 in two of the Group’s three 
other target markets: life sciences and specialised 
lighting. Of particular note, the life sciences business 
was awarded an Innovate UK grant. In addition, 
after the year end, a commercial supply and license 
agreement was won from a US medical device 
company for light therapy products for the treatment 
of pain, soft tissue injury and dermatological conditions 
such as acne and skin anti-ageing. This underlines 
the value being built beyond Display and highlights 
the future potential in these other areas.
The Board has decided that the Solar assets are 
non-core and has commenced a process to divest 
these assets.
Over the year the Board made tough decisions 
to reduce costs which has led to a substantial 
reduction in headcount, the main expense of the 
business. During the period, average employee 
numbers reduced to 110 (2016: 129) and have fallen 
further to approximately 80 since the year end. 
However, that headcount reduction has not 
impacted the Group’s ability to manufacture 
product and sell its technology or its ability to 
develop next generation IP and product. 
Financial performance 
Revenues and other operating income in the year 
to 31 July 2017 were £1.6 million (2016: £0.8 million) 
and the loss before tax was £10.9 million (2016: loss 
before tax of £12.6 million). 
The Group continued to exercise careful cost control 
during the year. Cash, cash equivalents and deposits at 
the year end were £5.7 million (31 July 2016: £14.5 million; 
31 January 2017: £8.3 million). Cash balances have 
increased post year end as a consequence of the 
equity raise in November 2017 of £8.0 million net of 
expenses. No dividend is proposed for the year 
(2016: none).
Governance and Board
The Board recognises the value of meeting the 
highest standards of corporate governance and will 
continue to strive to achieve such standards for the 
benefit of all stakeholders.
Gordon Hall retired as a Non-executive Director of 
Nanoco on 31 January 2017, after eight years on the 
Board. Robin Williams stood down from the Board in 
July 2017 after three years with the Company as a 
Non-executive Director. We would like to thank both 
Gordon and Robin for their contribution to the business.
In April 2017 we announced the appointment of 
Dr Alison Fielding as a Non-executive Director. Alison 
brings an exceptional breadth of relevant skills to the 
Nanoco Board, with her background in chemistry and 
her extensive commercial, financial and international 
experience across the technology sector. 
Employees and shareholders
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of 
Nanoco’s employees for their achievements during 
the year and for their commitment to the Group. 
Nanoco benefits from an exceptional, multi-national 
team and the Board is enormously appreciative of 
its contributions and loyalty in what has been a 
challenging period.
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their 
continuing support and look forward to meeting 
as many as possible at our AGM to be held on 
12 January 2018. 
Outlook
I am confident about the relevance of our 
technology in display and other markets as well 
as our ability to execute and deliver orders and 
sales and I remain positive about the prospects 
for the Group.
