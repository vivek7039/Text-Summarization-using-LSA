 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW
“ T H E F IN A N CI A L 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
ARE THE RESULT OF 
OUR RELENTLESS AND 
UNCOMPROMISING 
EXECUTION OF 
THE STRATEGY.”
OVERVIEW
During the year, the Group delivered 
on a number of the strategic milestones 
we have set for ourselves; we achieved 
double-digit profit margins in Industrial, 
and our Healthcare revenue has surpassed 
£100m. In addition we accomplished the 
audacious goal we set for ourselves four 
years ago; an internal goal of reaching 
£500m market capitalisation when it stood 
at less than £100m at the time. While we 
pause to reflect on the accomplishments, 
we are keenly aware that the real challenge 
is to maintain and surpass the past 
trajectory. We are confident that we can 
deliver the next set of milestones and goals 
as the opportunities and potential for both 
Healthcare and Industrial are still significant.
In Healthcare our strategy is to be the 
strategic turn-key partner of choice to our 
global Healthcare customers. We believe 
that by broadening our offerings and 
capabilities we can continue to build 
our market leading position in a growing 
and expanding market. In addition to the 
underlying growth in healthcare due to 
favourable demographics, we are also at 
the forefront of an accelerating outsourcing 
trend. As we review the growing pipeline of 
projects and potential acquisitions, we are 
confident that we can maintain double-digit 
growth in Healthcare, organically and 
through acquisition. 
Industrial serves diverse markets and 
geographies and its revenue performance 
reflects the composite macro dynamics. 
We focus on key defensible markets where 
we have opportunity to gain market share 
in the US$30 billion pressure sensitive 
material market. Our strategy is to continue 
to deliver profit growth by focusing on 
the optimisation of our assets through 
relentless operational execution and 
achieve mid-teens profit margins, 
comparable to market leaders.
OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2016/17
The Group focus on execution against 
the consistent strategic objectives outlined 
above has helped Scapa to deliver record 
results once again in 2016/17. Group 
revenue increased 13.3% to £279.6m 
or 1.7% on a constant currency basis.

Group Chief Executive
6 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 6 STRATEGIC REPORT Healthcare revenue increased 16.5% to 
£108.7m or 5.0% at constant currency. 
We acquired EuroMed, a US-based 
hydrocolloid wound care solution company, 
in May 2016. Excluding ten months of 
EuroMed, the organic revenue increased 
5.8% or (4.6)% at constant currency. 
Healthcare growth was against a very 
strong comparator, 26.4% growth in 2016, 
driven by product launches of two of our 
customers and new pricing on a contract 
extension which we signed last year. We 
expect that, as we move further toward 
turn-key solutions, our revenue will be 
more volatile on a short-term basis driven 
by product launches and campaigns of 
our customers. However, we remain very 
confident of the outlook for the business 
and have seen a significant growth in the 
sales pipeline that is transitioning to higher 
value, higher margin turn-key products 
or components based on Scapa IP 
and innovation. 
Healthcare profits increased 18.6% to 
£16.6m, or 4.4% at constant currency, 
improving margins to 15.3% as we improve 
efficiency and shift further to turn-key 
solutions. We expect that the higher margin 
achieved during the second half of the year 
can be maintained and, as we continue to 
focus on operational efficiencies and the 
revenue profile shifts more toward turn-key 
solutions, the margins should continue to 
improve further.
In May 2016, we completed the acquisition 
of EuroMed, the hydrocolloid wound care 
company based in Orangeburg, New York. 
With its intellectual properties and innovation 
portfolio, the acquisition significantly 
enhances our design and development 
capabilities, which further strengthens our 
value chain and deepens our strategic 
engagement with our Healthcare customers. 
EuroMed has integrated well, particularly after 
the backlog and cost base normalised post 
transaction. The second-half performed well 
both in revenue and profit, with second-half 
profits ahead of our initial expectations. 
Industrial revenue increased 11.4% to 
£170.9m, or (0.3)% at constant currency. 
Cable performed well, driven by general 
improvement in the clean energy 
sector and a contract win in the US. 
The Construction segment also delivered 
above-market growth, including in France. 
The positives were offset by a decline in 
Auto and Specialty Products. Our strategy 
to focus on operating efficiencies and 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), 
enables us to deliver double-digit profit 
growth despite flat revenue. Industrial 
profits increased by 66.4% to £17.8m, 
45.9% growth at constant currency, and 
margins were increased to 10.4% from 
7.0%. The improvement in profit was driven 
by (i) operational efficiencies; (ii) lower input 
costs; and (iii) initial benefit from the closure 
of Rorschach. We expect that we will see 
an additional £1.0m profit improvement 
next year from the closure. Despite 
reaching the double-digit profit margin 
target we set for ourselves, we believe 
that there are still significant opportunities 
to further improve our Industrial margin 
by continuing to execute our strategy. 
We believe that we can deliver mid-teens 
profit margin through additional operational 
efficiencies and asset rationalisation.

STRATEGIC REPORT
6 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 7 6 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
Group trading profit increased to £29.2m, a growth of 37.1% or 18.2% at constant exchange rates, and margins increased to 10.4%. The 
Group benefited from a post-Brexit currency tailwind and the trading profit constant currency result was also well ahead of expectations 
for the year. Cash generation was strong, and we ended the year leveraged at 0.45 times EBITDA after paying US$35m for the acquisition 
of EuroMed.
STRATEGIC PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR
At the start of the last financial year we identified a series of key goals and priorities for the year:
STRATEGIC PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR
HEALTHCARE What we said we would do
Continue delivering profitable growth 
organically and through acquisitions.  
We will continue to strengthen our  
value chain and deepen our strategic 
engagement with our global customers.
What we have achieved
The commercial project pipeline has been improved in terms 
of the number, quality and range of projects under development. 
Scapa is well positioned to help our customers improve cost, 
supply chain efficiency and speed to market. With the successful 
acquisition and integration of EuroMed, Scapa has added to its 
IP portfolio and has further moved the business towards higher 
value-add turn-key products. First Water, acquired in 2015, 
performed strongly again this year. We have long-term 
commercial agreements with our major Healthcare customers 
that underpin £200m in revenue over the life of the contracts.
INDUSTRIAL What we said we would do
Further drive ROCE through optimisation 
of the asset base. Continue to focus on 
efficiency improvement and cost control. 
Focus on key markets where we can gain 
market share.
What we have achieved
Driving increased ROCE through optimisation of the asset base 
has been a key feature of the Scapa Industrial strategy. During 
the year the facility in Rorschach, Switzerland was closed and 
the majority of the production transferred to the existing facility 
in Valence, France. The project was completed on time and 
on budget, with minimal service interruption to customers, 
and has delivered on the commitment to generate £1.0m of profit 
improvement in the second half. We expect a further £1.0m of 
incremental savings in the first half of FY18. Our supply chain 
team and strong cost controls also contributed to the increase 
in margins, up from 7.0% last year to 10.4% in 2017.
ACQUISITIONS 
 
What we said we would do
Make further acquisitions to complement 
the current business or deliver a new 
strategic platform.
What we have achieved
EuroMed, a specialist producer of hydrocolloid products for 
advanced wound care and consumer healthcare products  
based in Orangeburg, New York, was acquired in May 2016 for 
US$35m and improves the range of technologies available to 
our customers. It has fitted seamlessly into the Scapa Healthcare 
Group and made a strong contribution to performance in the year.
8 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 8 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR CONTINUED
FINANCIAL What we said we would do
Continue to improve the Group’s pension 
and tax positions.
What we have achieved
The gross pension deficit at year end was £31.4m (2016: £27.5m) 
– well controlled despite the adverse movement in the discount 
rate during the period. The Group continues to explore ways 
to manage the deficit and has conducted a number of projects 
during the year, including offering flexible retirement options and 
pension increase exchange plans. The effective tax rate for 2017 
was 20.0% (2016: 23.8%), reduced through a combination of 
strong UK trading and careful tax planning.
CULTURE What we said we would do
Promote The Scapa Way by embedding 
our core values and continuing to pursue 
entrepreneurialism across all aspects 
of our business.
What we have achieved
After the efforts to promote The Scapa Way and the Ten Guiding 
Principles over recent years this is now very visible in the Group 
and continually reinforced. The Scapa Academy allows for efficient 
online training on a variety of subjects, including the Code of 
Conduct which reflects both Scapa values and legal compliance. 
The annual CEO Awards produced another excellent list of projects 
that have delivered significant value across the business.
2017/18 STRATEGIC GOALS 
AND PRIORITIES 
Looking into the 2017/18 financial year, we 
believe that the strategies we have in place 
for our business units continue to give the 
right focus and will continue to deliver 
further value for our shareholders, and the 
continued emphasis and challenge within the 
business will be on execution against that 
strategy as the pace of projects accelerates:
• Healthcare: Continue delivering  
profitable growth organically and  
through acquisitions. We will continue  
to strengthen our value chain and 
deepen our strategic engagement  
with our global customers, and convert 
the increased project pipeline to revenue. 
Continue to shift further into turn-key 
solutions with Scapa’s IP and innovation
• Industrial: Further drive ROCE through 
optimisation of the asset base.  
We will continue to focus on efficiency 
improvement and cost control, and focus  
on key markets where we can gain 
market share. We will continue the path 
to industry average margins
• Make further acquisitions to complement 
the current business or deliver a new 
strategic platform
• Continue to improve the Group’s  
pension and tax positions, and review 
the Company’s banking facilities
• Continue to focus on talent development 
and succession planning to ensure that 
we have the right people embedded  
with our core values to further drive 
the growth of the business
OUTLOOK
We achieved some significant milestones 
during the year as a result of our relentless 
and uncompromising execution of the 
strategy. Whilst much has been achieved, 
we believe that much more potential remains 
to be fulfilled in both Healthcare and Industrial 
and we have set the goals for the next phase 
of our growth, which we are confident we 
can deliver.
We continue to execute the strategy that 
we have outlined for both Healthcare and 
Industrial. We have a team with a strong 
track record of delivery. The Group is 
well positioned to leverage the recent 
accomplishments and continue to make 
further progress in the year ahead.
