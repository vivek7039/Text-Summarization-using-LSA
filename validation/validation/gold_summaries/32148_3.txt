 Chairman’s statement
Good progress in converged 
communications in Europe
Europe remains our single biggest market 
and investment area and is at the heart 
of our “Gigabit Vodafone” converged 
communications strategy. Building on the 
success of Project Spring we continue to invest 
in network quality and customer experience, 
driving subscriber growth across mobile, 
broadband and TV. We are making good 
progress in our major markets, Germany, Italy 
and Spain, while in the UK our priority, for the 
moment, has to be on getting the basics right 
again. The completion of our merger in the 
Netherlands with Ziggo is another big step 
forward for our convergence strategy.
In order to enable an adequate return on the 
massive investments that will be required 
to provide Europe with the infrastructure 
required for a competitive economy in the 
age of digitalisation, a predictable regulatory 
framework is required that supports both 
investment and competition. In this regard 
we are encouraged by the European 
Commission’s (‘EC’) revised European 
Framework Review for Telecoms. In particular, 
the focus on passive infrastructure remedies 
and co-building arrangements, which have 
proven so successful in Spain and Portugal, 
is encouraging, as is the proposal to extend 
spectrum licence terms to at least 25 years. 
As the negotiations on the revised Framework 
enter a critical phase, we need to ensure 
that these well-balanced proposals are not 
diluted – both to avoid future incumbent 
re-monopolisation risks, and to pave the way 
for competitive investment in Europe’s future.
Driving consolidation in India; 
strengthening leadership 
in Africa
It has been a turbulent year in India. The launch 
of free services by a new entrant has disrupted 
an already hypercompetitive market and 
clouded the near and medium-term outlook 
for the industry. As a consequence Vodafone 
decided to stop the IPO process and instead 
look for in-market consolidation options. 
This has resulted in the announced merger 
proposal between Vodafone India and 
Idea Cellular, which will create a new, more 
competitive market player with the scale 
to invest in India’s digital future, while also 
capturing substantial synergies. 
We are very pleased with our progress 
in Africa where we have further strengthened 
our leadership positions, both at Vodacom 
in South Africa and Safaricom in Kenya.
Please see Vittorio Colao’s comments on pages 
12 to 15 for further insight into our strategy.
Our contribution to  
society is substantial
We are convinced that over the long-term 
the success of our business is closely tied 
to the success of the communities in which 
we operate. Consequently, a core part of our 
strategy and business model is to ensure that 
Vodafone’s digital networks and services act 
as a catalyst not only for economic growth, 
but also for equality and empowerment. 
Our “sustainable business strategy” section 
outlines our approach, including our ambition 
to connect an additional 50 million women 
living in emerging markets by 2026 (see 
pages 26 and 27), as well as our commitment 
to operating responsibly. For example, our  
report on “T axation and our total economic 
contribution to public finances” highlights 
our total contribution to governments 
of €15.6 billion in the 2016 financial year. 
Our charitable activities are also expanding 
in scope, as the Vodafone Foundation 
leverages our technology and expertise 
with funding from external NGOs and other 
partners to expand its impact. I recommend 
you take a look at our website for more 
information on the activities of our Foundation. 
Improving returns on capital 
remains a key priority
We are confident in our strategic direction, 
our adjusted EBITDA growth continues 
to improve and our adjusted EBIT is also 
now recovering. 
But we cannot yet be satisfied by the returns 
that we are achieving on the substantial 
organic and inorganic investments that the 
Group has made in recent years. 
As our CFO Nick Read explains in his 
introduction to our business model on page 
1 6, the solution to this challenge is threefold: 
continued profitable revenue growth, with tight 
cost control; portfolio management to gain 
sufficient (in-market) scale to earn attractive 
long-term returns; and a compensation 
approach which focuses more on adjusted EBIT , 
i.e., the profits after capital investment costs, 
and less on adjusted EBITDA, a change which 
we hope the industry will follow.
During the year the Vodafone share price 
on a total return basis has been broadly stable, 
underperforming the FTSE 100. This partly 
reflected a strong recovery by commodity 
producers and cyclically exposed companies, 
which accelerated after the US election results, 
as well as concerns over rising competition 
in the telecoms sector following new entrants 
in India and next year in Italy. 
Overall, the Board remains confident that the 
Group’s cash generation, and consequently 
its return on capital, will continue to recover. 
This confidence is reflected in our unchanged 
intention to grow the dividend, as exhibited 
by the 2.0% increase in the dividend to  
14.77 eurocents for the year.
In concluding, on behalf of the Board I would 
like to express our appreciation to Nick Land 
and Phil Y ea, who will not seek re-election at our 
Annual General Meeting in July 201 7 after 
more than ten years of valuable service. I would 
also like to thank our employees and business 
partners for their efforts and contribution 
to Vodafone’s progress, as well as our 
shareholders for their support and confidence.
