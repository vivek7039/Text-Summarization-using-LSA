 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004   03
ONE TO ONE WITH TOM GLOCER
Our CEO answers the key questions about Reuters
Q What was the high point of 2004?
We increased Group operating profit by 51% to £197 million as our sales
began to recover. User accesses also started to climb again during the year,
reaching 328,000, an increase of 14,000 since the end of the first quarter.
… and the low point?
Unfortunately, our journalists and photographers are all too often exposed to
danger as they report world events. I deeply regret that in the last year, three
have lost their lives: Adlan Khasanov in Chechnya and Dhia Najim and Rashid
Khaled in Iraq. Their deaths are a searing reminder of the heroism of Reuters
journalists who put their lives on the line to report the reality of conflict to
those of us who live in a safer environment. 
Q You say Reuters is being transformed – from what to what?
In short, from a company at the edge to a great company again. The Reuters
of three years ago was at a crisis point. Our revenues were falling rapidly, we
were losing market share, our costs were too high, and our organisation was
too complex. Today, two-thirds of the way through Fast Forward, I’m pleased
with our progress. We have strengthened our product line, we are meeting 
our cost savings targets and we have done much to simplify the company and
reduce our portfolio. It’s a tough process, and one that will continue this year,
but it’s worth it because I truly believe we are on the way to making Reuters 
a great company again. 
Q What is being done to improve Reuters products?
The answer, and our approach, begins with identifying and understanding
customer needs. I think we are doing a much better job at this, and the results
show in new or significantly improved products such as Reuters 3000 Xtra,
Reuters Knowledge and Reuters Station. What I believe we need to improve 
is speed of execution and responsiveness to customers. Part of the answer 
lies in the cultural transformation we have underway at Reuters, and part lies 
in organising ourselves better. Towards this end, we reorganised our
Development and Operations groups at the beginning of 2005 to integrate
our software developers directly into the Customer Segment business teams
and focus on Customer Service.
Q What more can be done to improve customer satisfaction?
Our customer satisfaction score continued to improve during 2004, and I am
proud of the way the Reuters culture is changing to put the customer at the
heart of everything we do. However, our customer satisfaction took a hit in 
the fourth quarter in the wake of the power disruption we experienced last
October at our London data centre. It brought home to me just how integral
we are to the way our customers run their businesses and how we can create 
a competitive advantage for Reuters by increasing our investment in business
continuity and disaster recovery. 
Q Where do you expect Reuters growth to come from in the next few years?
Our dialogue with customers, investors and Reuters own staff has shifted from
one of recovery to growth. This is a challenge I take up eagerly. We are hard at
work on an ambitious growth strategy which will follow the completion of the
Fast Forward transformation plan in 2005.
We start from a good base. Our financial services market is returning to growth
after several difficult years; we will seek to outgrow the market by increasing
share. We are launching innovative trading systems to grow usage revenues
alongside subscription revenues. We are investing in parts of our business 
with high growth potential such as risk management systems and enterprise
information products, and we are expanding our business in emerging markets
such as China and India. Finally, as we take steps to reinforce the power of 
the Reuters brand, we believe there is more we can aspire to in the provision
of information direct to consumers.
