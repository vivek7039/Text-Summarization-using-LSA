 GBGI Annual Report 2017 02
Strategic Report
Chairman’s statement
Overview
I am delighted to introduce the maiden Annual Report and 
Accounts for GBGI for the year ending 30 June 2017. It has 
been a landmark year for the Company, having achieved 
a successful AIM listing in February 2017. This report covers 
the performance of the Group’s pre listing parent Saxton 
Lane from 1 July 2016 to 21 February 2017 and GBGI 
Limited from 22 February 2017 to 30 June 2017. Building 
on our proven growth track record, the Group grew gross 
written premiums to in excess of $183.5 million for the 
first time in its history, with revenue for the year growing 
over 23 percent. 
This performance has been achieved against the 
demanding backdrop of preparing the business for its 
admission to AIM and the consequent transition of the 
business to comply with the high-governance and ethical 
standards of the QCA Corporate Governance Code for 
Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies. 
Over the past year we have delivered a strong financial 
performance, further strengthening our balance sheet 
and declaring a maiden dividend.
Progressive change
Reflecting on 2017 I am pleased with the significant strides 
made by GBGI. We have delivered on our business plans 
and have continued to distribute and underwrite medical, 
life and disability, and travel insurance across over 
120 jurisdictions worldwide. The completion of our 
AIM listing earlier this year was a landmark event for the 
business. The funds raised have improved an already 
robust capital position, with our solvency coverage ratio 
standing at 150.4 percent at 30 June 2017 and A.M. Best, 
the ratings agency, upgrading its outlook on GBGI’s 
Financial Strength rating in July 2017. The positive 
reputational benefits from the listing have already 
been felt in terms of commercial momentum.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Strategic and operational evolution
During the year we further diversified our business by risk, 
product, distribution partner and geography. We expanded 
our business into the Georgia region, via an investment 
with a local operator, whilst strengthening origination 
relationships worldwide. Our strategic reinsurance 
agreement with AXA, concluded in March 2017, offers 
both a fundamentally strong risk partner and a commercial 
arrangement, which will allow us to open up material 
new growth avenues. Good progress has already been 
made on this front. 
Operationally we have been focused on adapting our 
business for current and future growth, investing in 
decentralising operations and augmenting our IT 
infrastructure to enable operational effectiveness.
Our aim is quite simply to offer the best possible levels of 
customer service, enabling high retention levels and future 
referrals from our distribution partners. Controlling our 
value chain via integrated operations is key and we support 
our policyholders via a global network of offices providing 
medically trained 24/7 support.
The Board and governance
The corporate governance environment of the business 
has undergone significant change during the year, in 
keeping with the requirements of being public and 
recognising the size and scope of the business today. 
In addition to my appointment as Non-Executive Chairman 
the Group welcomed Anne Gunther, Murray Wood and 
David Gibson as Non-Executive Directors effective from 
admission to AIM in February 2017. In July 2017 the Board 
welcomed Doug Trussler as a new Non-Executive Director 
and representative of our long term shareholder, Bison 
Capital.
To better align with our business model, we also have 
changed the Company’s year-end date to 31 December 
from 30 June. That means our next Annual Report will be 
due out early in the second quarter of calendar year 2018.
Dividend
The profitability of our business combined with the 
strength of our solvency position have allowed us to 
declare a maiden dividend, in line with our stated policy. 
We have proposed a final dividend of $0.06 for the year 
to 30 June 2017 and looking forward we intend to adopt 
a progressive dividend policy.
Outlook
As I close my first financial year as Chairman we are 
pleased with the significant progress we have made. 
We are well positioned to build on our momentum as we 
look forward into 2018. We have a proven business model, 
strong financial profile and a drive to deliver sustainable 
growth that is underpinned by prudent underwriting –
which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver enhanced 
shareholder returns for the future.
I would like to thank my fellow board members, the senior 
leadership team and all colleagues across the business 
for their contribution to a year of strategic evolution. It is 
their knowledge, skills and professionalism that delivers 
for customers and shareholders and it is my privilege as 
Chairman to work alongside them.
