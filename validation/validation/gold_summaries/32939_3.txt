annual report and accounts 2017
I am pleased to present a solid set of full year results 
for 2017, with stable trading performance and strong 
underlying cash flow which continues to support our 
progressive dividend policy.
chairman’s statement
Our core business continues to 
perform solidly. As announced 
previously, revenue levels in 2017 were 
impacted by customer consolidation 
in our Data Centre operations during 
2016 and the rescheduling of our 
directory distribution. This revenue 
reduction was offset in part through 
continued growth in our Global 
Solutions business, driven by our 
Strongest Signal Mobile solution, 
M2M, and international traveller 
propositions. The agreement signed 
with China Unicom in December 
2016 to provide connectivity for 
China Unicom’s UK based Mobile 
Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) 
service grew slowly in 2017, due 
to technological challenges which 
have now been addressed, and  
we expect this agreement to bring 
further growth in 2018.
Our Transformation Programme, 
launched in October 2016, 
is progressing well with the 
implementation of IT systems 
and improvements in our internal 
processes and organisational 
structure. The associated costs 
are on track and the programme 
is due to complete in 2018.
Vannin Ventures was launched 
in 2016 to create future medium- 
term growth opportunities for the 
Company. Following on from its 
acquisition of Partitionware in 2016, it 
acquired a second company, Goshawk 
Communications Limited, a business 
focused on services to help the hard 
of hearing.
The Isle of Man economy remains 
stable and resilient with unemployment 
at only 0.8%. We continue to work 
with the Isle of Man Government on 
attracting business to the Island, and 
our telecommunications infrastructure 
and services play an important part 
in the Island’s continued success.
Dividend
The Board has declared a final 
dividend of 7.5p per share to be paid 
on 29 June 2018. This will bring the 
full year dividend to 11.4p (2016: 10.9p). 
The shares will trade ex-dividend on 
24 May 2018 and will have a record 
date of 25 May 2018.
Outlook
The Company’s strategy continues 
to focus on both maintaining our core 
market position on the Isle of Man 
through high quality customer service 
enhanced by our Transformation 
Programme, and seeking on- and 
off-island growth by leveraging our 
mobile infrastructure and exploring 
new innovative products and services 
for our customers.

We expect that our core domestic 
business (Fixed Line, Broadband and 
Data) and Mobile revenue streams 
will be supported by continued 
improvement in our on-island network 
infrastructure, resulting in overall stable 
revenues in our core lines of business.
We remain positive about the future 
progress in our Global Solutions 
business, building upon the successes 
of 2017 and with new opportunities 
also starting to contribute revenue. 
Following the return to growth within 
our Data Centre business in H2 2017, 
we expect this area of the business will 
continue to grow in 2018, supported 
by new product development.
The recent acquisitions of 
Partitionware in 2016 and Goshawk 
in 2017 by our business incubator, 
Vannin Ventures, are exciting 
opportunities that we expect 
will contribute to the Group’s 
growth strategy.
Our net debt/underlying EBITDA 
ratio of 2.1x (2016: 1.9x) and £10m 
of committed and unutilised loan 
facilities at year end means that 
we are well capitalised.
The Group’s excellent cash conversion 
enables us to support our ongoing 
Transformation Programme and our 
progressive dividend policy.
