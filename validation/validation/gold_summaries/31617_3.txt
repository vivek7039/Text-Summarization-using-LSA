Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
2017 was another year of strong progress for 
CYBG, with good momentum in the execution of 
the three pillars of our strategic plan – sustainable 
customer growth, efficiency and capital optimisation 
– and with it the successful delivery of our financial 
targets for 2017. The hard work of the Board, the 
Executive Leadership Team and all of our colleagues 
means I am pleased to be able to reiterate our 
medium-term guidance with renewed confidence. 
The Group’s successful delivery this year means 
that I am pleased to announce that the Board is 
recommending the payment of our inaugural dividend 
of 1.0 pence per share. Since the Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) we have talked about being a dividend 
paying stock and this proposed dividend represents 
a landmark event in the process of transforming 
CYBG into a bank that generates and distributes a 
sustainable return on its equity to shareholders. The 
continued delivery of our strategy should help us to 
build on this firm foundation as we move forward.
As well as their commitment to our customers, I am 
very proud of the way my colleagues support the 
communities in which we operate. Almost 7,000 
volunteering hours were undertaken during 2017 
and, with matching through our charity foundation, 
we have raised over £5.8m for our charity partner 
Hospice UK among a number of other initiatives. 
Economic conditions in the UK remain muted 
but, for the moment at least, stable. Despite the 
uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations and 
increased inflation causing real wage deflation, 
we have not seen a deterioration in the quality of 
our assets and we remain focused on delivering 
sustainable growth within our prudent risk appetite.
I would like to thank all of our colleagues, the 
Executive Leadership Team and the Board for 
their continued dedication and commitment to 
the transformation of CYBG. I would also like to 
personally thank Richard Gregory who left the Board 
in January for his contribution over many years. 
Our performance in 2017 represents a significant 
achievement. It is only the first step in delivering our 
three-year plan. We therefore remain focused on 
executing the strategy we outlined at our Capital 
Markets Day in September 2016, in order to deliver 
an exceptional customer experience for our 
personal and SME customers and sustainable 
returns to our shareholders.
