 As we looked ahead at the beginning of 2002, we shared
the widespread optimism that we would see a recovery
in the major economies around the globe, stronger stock
markets and rising consumer confidence. Instead, as the
year progressed, it became clear that 2002 would be
another very challenging year for business. The majority
of our major markets, with the notable exception of China,
experienced little or no economic growth and fragile
consumer confidence.
The weakness in global stock markets and the effect on
individual and household net worth and consumer sentiment
gave cause for widespread concern, as did the continuing
anxiety over the threat of terrorism and, particularly in the
latter half of the year, the increased threat to global security.
When one adds to this mix of negative factors, the shocking
revelations of corporate malfeasance and large corporate
failures, principally in the United States, during the year, it is
perhaps surprising that consumer behaviour was not even
more seriously affected.
With this as the geo-political and economic backdrop, I
am pleased to record that ICI finished the year in sounder
shape, financially, than it was a year earlier. Thanks to strong
shareholder support for the Rights Issue in the first quarter,
combined with the proceeds from the sale of assets and
tightly focused management of working capital, your Company’s
balance sheet has been substantially strengthened. These
actions to reduce Group debt were successful in protecting
our credit rating. With the actions taken during 2002 behind
us, the shape and structure of the Group is now essentially
set and our primary focus for the future will be on the growth
and development of our International Businesses.
Despite the weak economic environment, the International
Businesses turned in a creditable performance. The Group
achieved sales of £6,125m in 2002, 5% lower than in 2001,
mainly due to business disposals and exchange translation
effects. Profit before tax at £400m was essentially the same
as in 2001 and earnings per share for 2002 were 23.7p, both
quoted before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
The dividend for the year was 7.5p.
As we look to 2003, we believe it would be prudent to
assume that the competitive environment will continue to be
challenging and that high levels of customer satisfaction will
require the very highest levels of quality, value and technology.
This standard of performance must be achieved with world-
class productivity and overall business efficiency to achieve
satisfactory financial results.
The ICI team is dedicated to achieving these imperatives.
We have a highly skilled and motivated management and
workforce and immense technological capability. Our products
number in the tens of thousands and we compete in a wide
range of market segments, including food, personal care,
home improvement and adhesives. We believe that our
extensive product and technology base provides us with a
solid foundation on which to build. As in 2002, the efficient
use of capital will be of the highest priority. We will continue
to compete vigorously in all of the world’s major market
places and will place particular emphasis on the high
growth countries.
And finally, a comment on governance. ICI has a long history
of adhering to a strong ethical code. It is a tradition of which
we are proud and, as custodians of that tradition, we are
deeply conscious of the trust that you have placed in us. I
want to assure you that your Board of Directors continues
to be dedicated to the highest standards of corporate
governance, financial control and reporting.
I would like to thank you again for your support for the Rights
Issue in early 2002 and, on behalf of the entire ICI team, give
you our pledge that we will continue to do all in our power to
deliver value to you, our shareholders.
