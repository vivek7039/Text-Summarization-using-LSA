CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
This has been an historic year, culminating with 
November’s admission to the premium segment 
of the London Stock Exchange, which saw us 
welcome our new shareholders to the Company.
My brother Lydur and I founded Bakkavor over  
30 years ago and it is now a business which 
employs around 19,000 people across 39 sites in 
the UK, US and China and, this year, generated 
revenue of over £1.8 billion. 
A YEAR OF GOOD PROGRESS
I am pleased to report that the past twelve months have seen us 
leverage our scale, innovation credentials and passion for food to 
make further good progress across the Group.

Operating profit increased by 5.1% from £91.5 million to £96.2 
million in 2017. This was a good performance given the 
unprecedented inflationary pressures seen in the year.
In the UK, we worked closely with our key customers to  
mitigate much of the impact of raw material inflation and the 
increase in labour costs, with our strong focus on efficiencies  
and cost control. Internationally, we saw further growth, 
particularly in China, as both businesses benefited from the 
transfer of our UK expertise to these regions and continued 
investment in our infrastructure.
FOCUSED INVESTMENT
We believe there is significant potential to develop our category 
presence across the business and during 2017 we continued to 
invest in selective scalable capacity and new capabilities. This 
included investment in automation and factory site expansions. 
The Group’s listing on the London Stock Exchange included  
a primary issue of £100 million which will enable us to  
accelerate our investment programme, creating further value 
for investors and stakeholders, and bring more great tasting  
food to consumers. 
A COMMITTED WORKFORCE 
Our success is driven by the passion, dedication and commitment 
of all the people we employ across the Group. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank each of those colleagues for their 
efforts and the contribution they have made in getting Bakkavor  
to where it is today. 
In the UK, we employ approximately 17,000 people and a 
significant number may potentially be impacted by Brexit. 
Although the outcome remains unclear, we have taken steps in 
the year to support many of our employees with information on 
developments and related guidance and we continue to review  
the business impact of potential changes. 
CORPORATE STRUCTURE
This year has been an exciting year but, nonetheless, a disruptive 
one, with significant management time taken up by the public 
listing. I am particularly impressed by the focus and commitment 
shown by our teams to ensure our customers remained 
unaffected by this corporate activity. 
Ahead of the public listing we took steps to strengthen our Board 
and I look forward to working with our new Board and benefiting 
from their experience as we take the Group forward in the next 
stage of its development.
A CONFIDENT OUTLOOK
The second half of 2017 saw volume growth impacted as UK 
consumers reacted to significant inflationary pressure. As 
expected, this trend has continued into 2018 and is likely to 
remain until inflation eases. Later in the year, we expect our 
volume growth to benefit from improved market conditions and 
new business. 
Despite these industry-wide challenges, we are confident that  
our scale, track record of innovation and focus on operational 
efficiencies ensures we are well placed to deliver ongoing 
profitable growth, both from existing business and our  
long-term investment strategy.
DELIVERING THE BEST FOR OUR 
PEOPLE AND OUR CUSTOMERS  
IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR 
FUTURE SUCCESS
14 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report Innovation is one of our core values and we are extremely proud of our capabilities  
and expertise, always challenging ourselves to think of great ideas that our 
customers and consumers love.
By collaborating across our sites, we bring together different competencies including 
allergen management, delicate fruit preparation and technical yoghurt processing.
These capabilities, combined with our consumer insight expertise, enabled us to create 
and launch a range of fresh breakfast compotes, including a pomegranate bircher 
muesli, to appeal to consumers looking for ‘ready to eat’ healthy breakfast ‘on the move’.
Pomegranate seeds have become increasingly popular  
due to their health benefits — they also make a great topping 
on our breakfast pots.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Producing innovative, commercially successful food that offers 
choice, quality, convenience and freshness for consumers 
remains the foundation of our success and is what drives 
growth in the UK.
The Group has a proven operating model for a challenging 
operational environment, producing over 2,000 short shelf-life 
products at scale. This level of complexity gives us a unique 
competitive advantage in the UK segment, which contributed 
around 90% to total Group revenue in 2017.
During the past year, we have reinforced our leading position in 
each of the four FPF categories of meals, salads, desserts and 
pizza & bread, continuing to work collaboratively with key 
customers to support their growth plans through investments 
and innovation. 
Our close partnerships with our customers, our track record in 
food safety, combined with our proven ability to generate cash 
for reinvestment in the business for efficiencies, maintenance 
and growth, position us well to deliver on our UK strategy.
UK PERFORMANCE 
The UK business generated £1,636.3 million in revenue from 
continuing operations in 2017, up 4.6%
1
 compared to the prior 
year on a 52 week basis. Like-for-like revenue
2
 was £1,621.3 
million, which is 4.9% up on 2016.
Revenue growth in 2017 was partly driven by price increases 
agreed with customers in response to the significant raw material 
inflation in the year. Volume growth was strong in the first half of 
the year, supported by a number of significant business gains in 
the second half of the previous year; a testament to the Group’s 
innovation capabilities, product quality and market-leading 
technical standards. However, as expected, revenue growth 
slowed later in the year as higher retail pricing impacted volumes. 
Adjusted EBITDA
2
 for the year was £145.2 million compared with 
£137.7 million in 2016. As anticipated, margins remained under 
pressure throughout the year due to inflationary impacts. 
However, the business performed well to limit these impacts and, 
when combined with the volume benefits and tight cost control, 
the year saw an increase in the Adjusted EBITDA
2
 margin to 8.9%, 
20 basis points above the prior year. 
At an operational level, we remained focused on managing our 
capacity and investing when necessary to support our customers’ 
growth plans.
MANAGING INFLATIONARY IMPACTS
During 2017, we were impacted by a combination of 
unprecedented raw material inflation, largely driven by  
volatility in the dairy market and the impact of the weakness  
in Sterling, together with rising labour costs following further 
increases in the National Living Wage. Working closely with  
our customers, we successfully mitigated much of this  
inflation through a combination of pricing, product design  
and operational performance.
Our significant expertise in growing, planning and buying was 
critical during this past year of volatile input pricing. No more  
so than in the salads category, when, in the early part of the  
year, unforeseen weather conditions markedly affected leaf 
availability. The experience of the procurement team and the 
strong relationships Bakkavor has with suppliers, particularly 
those in Europe and the US, enabled the Group to maintain 
supplies during this very challenging period.
The rising labour costs experienced following further increases  
to the National Living Wage were largely offset by performance 
improvements through efficiency, capital expenditure projects  
and operational improvement plans in place across the business. 
These improvement plans, supported by the operational finance 
team, were targeted to maximise performance and opportunities 
for efficiency gains across the UK operations.

16 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report STRENGTHENING CUSTOMER PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH 
INSIGHT AND INNOVATION
We continued to focus during the year on strengthening our 
partnerships in the UK. Bakkavor has relationships with all the 
major UK grocery retailers, although around 86% of revenues  
are generated from its four biggest customers: Tesco; M&S; 
Sainsbury’s; and Waitrose. We continue to work closely with  
these strategic customers through dedicated teams to protect  
and enhance our partnerships; each team has a differentiated 
plan and a clear understanding of that customer’s fresh prepared 
food needs. 
Bakkavor’s extensive knowledge of key food trends and 
experience in creating innovative and great tasting food is  
widely recognised by its customers. Around 230 colleagues are 
dedicated to the development of high-quality products and in  
the year we created and launched approximately 500 new and 
improved products for customers. For example, in November 
2017, we launched a number of award-winning dessert ranges  
for Christmas, including a chocolate ‘dome’ which gained 
considerable positive press coverage. We also launched the UK’s 
first charcoal-base pizza range, which proved very popular with 
consumers and again attracted favourable media reviews. 
We also won a number of awards during 2017, including 
Innovation winner for the Prepared Salads Category and  
Innovative Product of the Year at the Grocer Own Label Food  
& Drink Awards 2017.
INVESTING FOR GROWTH
During 2017, the Group continued its UK capital programme, 
investing behind its facilities to support customer plans and 
maximise efficiencies and capabilities. 
In the year we have seen a number of new investments to enhance 
capacity and capability following business wins. Good examples of 
these include investments in our Holbeach pizza factory and our 
Crewe bread factory.
Towards the end of the year, we started work on a major 
£35 million expansion of our desserts facility in Newark. This 
investment will provide increased capacity following recent 
supplier consolidation in the category as well as market-leading 
innovation and state-of-the-art automation to support efficiency.
17 STRATEGIC REPORT
Bakkavor’s strategy to accelerate its performance in China and 
the US is borne from over 10 years of operating in these regions, 
where we have developed a strong understanding of these 
markets and their potential for high growth. 
The FPF markets in the US and China are significantly 
underserved when compared with the UK. Bakkavor has 
established itself as a pioneer in leveraging its UK expertise to 
drive the FPF proposition in the US, and in supplying international 
and local foodservice chains in China, with high standards of food 
safety and quality. 
Our international businesses in the US and China continue to 
grow as consumer preferences increasingly shift towards fresh 
prepared food. 
INTERNATIONAL PERFORMANCE 
Our International business, whilst still only representing around 
10% of the Group, has continued to grow. This business generated 
£178.5 million in revenue from continuing operations compared 
with £173.7 million in the prior year. On a like-for-like
2
 basis, 
which excludes the impact of foreign currency movements and 
the sale of the Group’s Belgian business NV Vaco BV on 1 August 
2016, revenues increased by 10.0% in the year to £179.0 million.
Adjusted EBITDA
2
 for the International segment was £7.4 million 
for the year, compared with £8.7 million in 2016. Whilst the 
business in China has profited from strong volume growth, 
inflationary pressures have partly offset this benefit. We also 
increased investment in our technical and commercial 
capabilities, particularly in the US, to ensure we have the 
appropriate infrastructure for future growth. 
FAVOURABLE MARKET TRENDS IN BOTH REGIONS
The US and China represent highly attractive opportunities for 
growth, and our target markets in these countries are forecast  
to grow by at least 10% per annum going forward.
Our US business saw further growth in demand for fresh  
prepared food during the year, with consumers switching away 
from frozen and long-life products and increasingly showing a 
preference for fresh ‘better for you’ food, such as clean label  
and organic products. 
The Group has continued to develop its US relationships with  
key strategic customers, extending its category portfolio with a 
successful new range of burritos, and introducing a new range  
of ready-to-cook meals with a major customer.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
In China, we saw strong growth as we continued to develop our 
presence in the international and local foodservice markets, 
fuelled by the rapid rate at which key customers are expanding 
their store and restaurant portfolios. This provides Bakkavor with 
a solid base for expansion. In addition, our investment in our new 
product development capabilities has broadened our offering to 
major customers, including for example the introduction of fresh 
soups, salads and breakfast products.
ACCELERATING PERFORMANCE THROUGH INVESTMENT
The relationship with a key customer in Texas has significantly 
strengthened during the year as we announced plans to invest 
$31 million in a dedicated new factory in San Antonio. Working in 
close partnership with our customer, the facility will supply a wide 
range of meals and is scheduled to start production later in 2018.
Whilst the Group already has an established presence in the  
US in the meals, dips and soups & sauces categories, the chilled 
bread market represents an exciting new growth area where  
we can capitalise on our UK expertise as market leader in this 
category. Following a period of market testing, we have now 
started work on a new bakery facility in Charlotte, which will  
also be operational later in 2018. 
In China, the Group is investing around £20 million in a new 
state-of-the-art factory just outside Shanghai in Haimen,  
East China, which again is due to start production in 2018  
and will provide additional capacity in this high-growth market.  
We have also committed £3 million of investment into a new 
high-quality bread facility near Shanghai, which has recently 
started production, as we again have the opportunity to capitalise 
on our UK expertise in this category.
