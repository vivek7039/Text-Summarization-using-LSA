*Underlying
The adjustments described below, 
collectively, are made to derive the 
underlying operating results of the 
Group. The underlying figures provide 
a consistent measure of business 
performance year to year, thereby 
enabling comparison and understanding 
of Group financial performance.
Throughout the Strategic report, unless 
otherwise stated, revenue, operating 
profit, operating margin, net finance 
costs, profit before tax and earnings per 
share refer to results before amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and exceptional 
items. Revenue, operating profit, 
operating margins and net finance costs 
also include the Group’s share of equity 
accounted joint ventures and associates. 
Operating profit and operating margin 
include investment income arising under 
IFRIC12 which is presented as financial 
income in the Income Statement. All 
numbers are stated before the effect 
of corporate tax rate changes. A 
reconciliation of statutory to underlying 
results is set out on page 31.

2 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 “I’ve always loved knowing how and why things work. With Babcock, I’m being given the chance to do exactly that. My PhD in Marine 
Toxicology certainly had a nuclear element to it, which comes in handy when I’m fixing a technical problem or making sure that people 
stay safe. A typical day involves writing reports – just as it did when I was a research scientist – but it also includes talking to colleagues 
inside Babcock and to clients about safety or technical queries that might have been raised. I’m also likely to get my overalls on to go and 
examine a submarine.
As chair of Plymouth Women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), I’m very involved with sending our STEM 
Ambassadors to events and schools. Teaching was an enjoyable and integral part of my role as a postdoctoral research scientist. My STEM 
work allows me to continue teaching people about why science is so important to society and the great careers that women can build in 
the sector.”
