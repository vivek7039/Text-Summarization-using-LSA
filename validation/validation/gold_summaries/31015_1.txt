Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
PERFORMANCE:
CEO Review
Overview of 2017 
It has been an important year for Centaur Media as we continued 
our transformation to becoming one of the UK’s leading B2B 
business information groups. We have invested in priority digital 
platforms, identified operational improvements and efficiencies 
and reshaped the portfolio through two strategically important 
transactions. 
The quality of revenue continues to improve, with a further increase 
in the percentage of recurring repeat revenues combined with a 
further reduction of exposure to print advertising, which remains 
in structural decline. This places Centaur Media on far stronger 
foundations for long-term growth and value generation. 
Recurring revenues now represent 44% of total revenues with 
underlying
1
 digital premium content and exhibition revenues 28% 
and 19% respectively. This healthily compares to 2014 when  
print and total advertising represented 24% and 31% of Group 
revenue respectively. 
The improvement in revenue mix reflects the successful execution  
of our business strategy with digital products and services that 
advise, inform and connect business professionals through insight, 
data and events. 
We are particularly pleased to have delivered an improved 
operational performance. This is reflected in adjusted operating 
profit
2
 of £6.6m. 
Overall, the underlying momentum of Centaur Media is encouraging, 
and the Board is confident in the long-term prospects of the Group.
Transformation of Centaur Media 
Four years ago, Centaur set off on a strategy to create a Group that 
could take advantage of the editorial expertise and connections 
of its publishing brands and simultaneously move away from the 
reliance on tactical trade advertising. By focusing on clients’ needs 
and challenges, we invested in building valuable content sources 
that our professional communities would be prepared to buy and 
subscribe to, in order to improve their business competitiveness. 
Throughout this period of change, the structural decline in  
print advertising has been well publicised, impacting our legacy  
print businesses. 
Against this background, we have maximised the contribution from 
these highly profitable advertising revenues, reinvesting the profits to 
both grow the reshaped Group and support the dividend policy.
2017 proved the year we were able to start to take advantage of the 
hard endeavours that began in 2014. 
Key highlights include:
• Our task to transform the Home Interest portfolio into a strong, 
competitive business was completed with the disposal of this 
non-core B2C Home Interest segment for a total consideration 
of £32.8m This enabled us to focus purely on B2B and acquire 
MarketMakers for an initial consideration of £13.3m excluding 
working capital. MarketMakers is now integrated, significantly 
enhancing our service to professional marketers. 
• Our success in building digital content products such as The 
Lawyer and events such as Festival of Marketing and Business 
Travel Show allowed us to exit challenging weekly print schedules 
– radically reducing the number of issues produced each year 
from over 300 to less than 75 and reducing our ongoing total print 
exposure to less than 10%. We are now in control of our print 
business and what we want from it.
• We addressed a significant number of finance process 
issues as the business changed its ways of working. This 
materially strengthened several aspects of the Group’s financial 
management whilst improving working capital and cash flow. 
Debtor days were reduced from 77 to 52 and cash conversion in 
2017 was 138% (2016: 133%).
“ We have successfully reshaped the portfolio, 
improved the long-term quality of our revenues 
and reduced our exposure to advertising. We 
are now a business information group with a 
strategy that continues to leverage our audience 
and increase our importance to customers.”

STRATEGIC REPORT
• We created a less complicated, more focused and nimble 
business as a result of strategic action taken in print and the 
B2C disposal. This has led to management identifying internal 
efficiencies which are being realised. Central overheads were 
reduced by £1.7m in 2017. 
In short, Centaur Media is now converting audiences to customers 
and consolidating around its strongest brands. The investment into 
new content sources is building new revenues of a higher quality 
and replacing declining advertising revenues. 
We have become a unique B2B group. We can offer our clients 
end-to-end solutions that combine the strengths of our publishing 
brands’ deep market knowledge with best-in-class business 
consultancy services. We have trusted brands and capabilities 
providing effective solutions for clients searching for information and 
insightful guidance. 
The Group is well placed for growth having strengthened its 
competitiveness, created products and services to meet customer 
demand and built capabilities to unlock its future growth. 
In respect of our three market segments, 86% of Group revenues 
are weighted towards the Marketing and Professional services 
segments with Financial services accounting for the remainder.
Strengthened balance sheet
The completion of the disposal of our Home Interest segment, 
combined with strong cash generation, has significantly 
strengthened our balance sheet. We now have net cash,  
with £25m of untapped credit facilities with which to make  
strategic acquisitions.
Dividend
In light of this performance, the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 1.5p per share, to give a total dividend for the year of 
3.0p per share.
Positive outlook
Although advertising market conditions remain challenging, they 
represent a decreasing share of Group revenue. 
The Group has made a positive start to 2018 and we remain 
confident that our strategy to invest in digital products and services 
which advise, inform and connect business professionals through 
insight, data and events, will continue to deliver long-term value for 
our clients and shareholders. 
We intend to grow both organically and through acquisition. Organic 
growth is forecast to come from improving customer lifetime value, 
cross-selling and international scalability of digital intelligence 
products. As well as improving profits from our consultancy and 
advisory business, we anticipate further growth following the 
acquisition of MarketMakers, which has already started to positively 
impact our client offering and internal capabilities. 
Segment review
Marketing
This segment includes all the Group’s brands that serve marketing 
and creative professionals including Econsultancy, Marketing Week, 
Festival of Marketing, Celebrity Intelligence, Fashion & Beauty 
Monitor, Design Week, Creative Review, Oystercatchers and 
Centaur’s most recent acquisition, MarketMakers.
The portfolio now represents 56% of the Group’s revenue. It is the 
strongest example of our Group strategy to continue to deliver long-
term value for our clients and shareholders by investment in digital 
products and services.
Marketing Week, alongside Creative Review and Design Week, 
accelerated its move away from print-based revenues in 2017 with 
a digital first, content-led strategy. Unlike 2016, these brands all 
suffered from double-digit decline in traditional advertising revenue 
and recruitment streams as clients throughout the year reduced their 
advertising spend. 
The opportunity now exists for our teams to offer broader horizontal 
client solutions – a key area of development for Centaur’s next 
phase of growth, helping us to further reduce exposure to 
volatile advertising streams by building higher value, longer term 
relationships with clients. 
Our focus on fewer, larger events has worked well with growth in 
profits for both Marketing Week Live and Festival of Marketing. The 
Festival, staged in October 2017, received positive reviews from 
delegates and commercial partners alike. Of particular note was 
the 37% growth in delegate revenues. With over 300 speakers and 
more than 200 hours of content, it is clear that marketers value the 
Festival’s content and are attending in increasing numbers to learn 
and network. Notable speakers included Stephen Fry, Mark Ritson 
and Jo Malone. Customer satisfaction scores (NPS) have increased 
year-on-year, firmly establishing the Festival as a leading global 
event. We’re delighted to see it continue to grow as the only global 
event in the sector where brand marketers comprise over 60% of 
its customer base compared with competitors such as Festival of 
Media and Advertising Week with 10-15%.
Marketing Week’s successful Mini MBA in Marketing underpinned 
the development of a Centaur-wide online classroom platform 
which successfully launched a series of modern-day micro learning 
modules and online classrooms for Econsultancy, Celebrity 
Intelligence and The Lawyer. 
Recognising the loyal and highly valuable audiences drawn together 
collectively through our three heritage publishing brands Marketing 
Week, Creative Review and Design Week, we are beginning to 
leverage their market influence as online digital ‘windows’. It is 
through these shop windows that we expect readers to access and 
purchase additional branded content such as market reports and 
training courses from Econsultancy and other affiliate partners. This 
pilot will continue to be monitored throughout 2018.

Centaur Media Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
PERFORMANCE:
CEO Review
2017 was a pivotal year for Oystercatchers as it integrated into 
Centaur and built a fresh new proposition combining the best of two 
worlds – Oystercatchers’ unique pitch model, consultancy, training 
and Club, alongside the expert content and events of Centaur 
brands such as Econsultancy and Festival of Marketing. 
The team had success in broadening their remit with clients such 
as EY and Samsung. It onboarded exciting new clients including 
Formula One and Centrica and brought new processes and 
transformational change to the Post Office and Bwin.
As a result of client success, the Financial Times acknowledged 
Oystercatchers as one of the UK’s leading management 
consultancies and awarded the brand four out of six stars in the 
marketing, brand and pricing category alongside AT Kearney, 
Capgemini and LEK Consulting. 
Both Econsultancy and Oystercatchers suffered from a decline in 
face to face training in the second half of the year. However, given 
market demand for Elearning and growth potential, Oystercatchers’ 
training team has been consolidated within Econsultancy creating a 
combined force to deliver digital excellence. In tandem, this internal 
move allows Oystercatchers to focus on its core consultancy 
services and help the wider Centaur Group improve horizontality and 
deliver end-to-end valuable solutions for clients. 
Meanwhile, Econsultancy’s sponsored research division recorded a 
strong year-on-year performance with key projects completed with 
global innovation and technology clients including Microsoft, Google, 
Adobe and LinkedIn.
Having entered 2017 with challenging underlying business trends for 
Econsultancy, Celebrity Intelligence and Fashion & Beauty Monitor 
digital products, we exited the year with a positive upswing. 
The marketing tech and digital product landscape has become 
increasingly competitive with many new entrants taking advantage 
of new cloud technologies leading to lower barriers to entry for 
learning and advisory products. As a result, driving our digital 
product development upgrades became a key focus for 2017 and 
will remain important throughout 2018. 
Along with Celebrity Intelligence and Fashion & Beauty Monitor, 
Econsultancy’s digital product offering will be upgraded to provide 
a more competitive ‘essential marketing learning tool’. With the 
product scope now well defined, dedicated Product Managers are 
building new customer-led product features and functionality which 
will be released throughout H2 2018. 
In 2017, Fashion & Beauty Monitor and Celebrity Intelligence 
benefited from the first overhaul of technical product upgrades 
and have introduced new social media analytics, market insight 
and research reports to their product suite. The Profile Group’s 
2017 technology roadmap involved both customer-facing front end 
development and back end capability infrastructure. 
The incorporation of machine learning and real-time data feeds 
is enabling greater automation across these digital subscription 
products and will deliver further cost reduction. During 2018, an 
expanded suite of e-learning products and advisory services, 
combined with the technical content and UX upgrades, will re-
establish our competitive brand USPs and help to build yield and 
new business. 
MarketMakers, our latest acquisition, is a B2B new business 
powerhouse. It offers creative services, data analytics, lead 
generation, marketing automation and telemarketing. The acquisition 
has enabled Centaur to deploy best practice telemarketing 
capabilities at scale and better leverage data insight. It has also 
created a base from which to exploit growing market demand for 
integrated, automated marketing and intelligence services. 
As we enter 2018 Centaur is trialling an outsourcing of subscription 
new business sales to MarketMakers to take advantage of its 
marketing automation technology and efficient, operational 
telemarketing infrastructure.
We anticipate a good year’s performance as remaining product 
upgrades are completed and the enhanced commercial capability of 
MarketMakers begins to connect.
Overall the Marketing segment continues to make progress. It is 
developing a robust operational infrastructure for scalable and 
sustainable growth coupled with deepening client relationships 
allowing Centaur to advise, inform and connect business 
professionals and sell multiple products across multiple brands.

There was positive momentum across both digital premium 
content billings and live events revenues offset by a 26% decline in 
advertising revenues. Around 35% of this segment’s revenues are 
derived from premium content, with 34% from live events, 18% from 
capability services and 13% from advertising. 
The decline in adjusted operating profits
2
 and margin reflect the 
impact of weaker advertising revenues and an increase in centrally 
allocated overheads following the disposal of the Home Interest 
segment. Reported operating profits were impacted by earn-out 
charges relating to the Oystercatchers acquisition of £0.6m (2016: 
£0.6m) and acquisition costs relating to MarketMakers of £0.6m.
Outlook: this segment is expected to exhibit steady growth into 
2018 driven by recurring digital premium content revenues and 
integration with MarketMakers.
Professional services
The Professional services segment includes two subsidiary markets: 
The Lawyer and Exhibitions. Around 60% of revenue comes from 
live events, 30% advertising and 10% premium content. 
Our exhibitions include Subcon, an exhibition that serves the sub-
contractor industry, Employee Benefits Live, Business Travel Show 
and The Meetings Show.
2017 was a significant year for the portfolio as we reduced our 
exposure to print revenue with the closure of the bi-monthly MWP 
in the engineering space and the move from weekly to monthly 
editions for The Lawyer and Employee Benefits which moved to 
digital only distribution.
The Lawyer 
The Lawyer is a multi-platform intelligence brand with digital 
subscriptions, live event and digital advertising revenue streams. 
Its content strategy continued to progress successfully. Premium 
content now represents 38% (including Clean Energy Pipeline)
of total revenue with over 160 large law firms taking up enterprise 
subscription licences. 
As we move into 2018, a new website is being developed to allow 
paying users to link seamlessly to The Lawyer’s exclusive data 
tables and deal information whilst providing access to market 
insight reports. By linking news, analysis, data and insight in 
one digital platform, The Lawyer is evolving as a market-leading 
digital information service. It has successfully moved away from 
30 years as a weekly print magazine to a monthly analytical 
and features driven magazine with themed issues, reports and 
customer interviews. In recognition of this strategy and successful 
execution, The Lawyer landed the prestigious Periodical Publishers 
Association’s Media Brand of the Year Award in 2017. 
The Lawyer Market Reports continued to deliver reliable revenue 
streams with the UK 200 series generating 9% growth year-on-year. 
Availability of all 17 reports on the new portal in 2018 should enable 
additional opportunities for dedicated account management teams 
to cross-sell subscriptions, data services and reports. 
Exhibitions
Collectively, Exhibitions performed well with underlying
1
 revenue 
growth of 6% on a reported basis as a result of the disposal of 
the Home Interest segment driven largely by the Business Travel 
Show at London’s Olympia Exhibition Centre. In 2017 the event 
hosted over 375 exhibitors, 425 hosted buyers and 7,000 visitors. 
Meanwhile, The Meetings Show continued to develop well with 
strong margin growth of 8% on revenue growth of 14% year-on-
year. Subcon performed well too with 25% visitor growth and 
strong underlying
1
 profit growth of 22%, helped by an increase 
in international exhibitors, and new on-site content and learning 
programmes. 
The Engineer’s focus has been to drive its online audience. Monthly 
page views have grown, with unique visitors up 4% year-on-year. 
Good progress was also made by developing brand-led events. 
‘Collaborate to Innovate’, a unique awards/conference event in its 
sector, launched well with Vince Cable as a keynote speaker.

Legal revenues were 2% below last year, reflecting weaker 
recruitment advertising which were partially offset by good growth in 
premium content revenues. Deferred revenues in the Legal portfolio 
were £1.1m at 31 December 2017, compared to £0.9m at the same 
time last year. The adjusted
2
 operating margin has increased from 
4.5% to 8.9%.
Outlook: The Lawyer and the Exhibition brands, particularly the 
Business Travel Show and Employee Benefits Live are all expected 
to add to the Group’s recurring revenue streams through growing 
exhibition and digital subscription revenues.
Financial services
This year saw a significant move away from traditional print 
platforms with Mortgage Strategy moving from weekly to monthly, 
Fund Strategy moving to digital only and the sale of Corporate 
Adviser. Money Marketing remains in weekly print but with reduced 
frequency during the year. The portfolio also includes subscription 
services Platforum, Taxbriefs and Headline Money.
Platforum continued to build on its reputation as a key reference 
point for asset managers, life companies and platforms on retail 
investment distribution. It is now firmly established as a subscription 
product with renewal rates of 85% by value and a series of  
growing events. 
Beyond Platforum, the Financial Services segment continues to offer 
targeted events for all sectors of the financial services community 
including large scale conferences, awards and exclusive invitation-
only summits for industry leaders. As a portfolio we are deliberately 
selective in our events – opting to support larger scale, repeatable 
events across big brands. Commercial packages are sold across the 
brands to enable cross-media solutions for sponsors and clients.

This segment’s revenues remain reliant on advertising, at 39% of 
the revenue mix, with 37% from premium content and 24% from 
live events. Reflecting the wider economic environment, advertising 
declined by 18% year-on-year, partly due to the move away from 
high frequency print. The second half of 2017 saw performance 
improve significantly. Supporting this is the move to digitally-led 
creative solutions for clients which is gaining traction as we move 
into 2018. 
The operating loss of £7.0m in 2016 was driven by an impairment of 
£7.2m. No impairment has been booked this year.
Outlook: despite the weakness reported in the first half of 2017, 
Financial services has strong brands, premium content and an 
increasingly agile digital delivery platform.

STRATEGIC REPORT
People 
Changes to the senior management team in 2016 have settled 
well and the diverse skills and experience that each Executive 
Committee member brings has allowed the Group to deliver 
significant operational success in 2017.
Whilst continuing to focus on immediate business delivery, the 
Executive Committee is keen to develop a culture that works 
horizontally together to deliver client solutions that advise, inform 
and connect. Our internal training plans are being developed to 
support this ambition. 
Our approach to diversity continues to be proactive through policies 
and working practices. Our male to female ratio is well balanced 
and we retain strong representation of women at a senior level. 
Two out of six (33%) of our Board members are female, and four 
out of six (66%) of our Executive Committee are female. Our family 
friendly policies include enhanced maternity and paternity leave, 
flexible work options, while our return rate of maternity leavers is in 
excess of 90%. A high percentage of staff, both male and female, 
work flexible/reduced hours including our COO, Company Secretary, 
an Oystercatchers Managing Partner, Group Head of HR and a 
Research Director. Two staff made use of shared parental leave 
during 2017.
We are delighted to see our Development Board, comprising some 
of our rising stars, continue to grow from strength to strength. The 
Development Board’s remit is ‘to change Centaur for good’ and 
act as a communications channel between our people and the 
senior leadership. Sponsored last year by Suki Thompson, the 
Development Board now leads our internal charity sponsorship 
activity and has planned and delivered new initiatives including 
a recognition scheme, football and softball teams, regular yoga, 
mindfulness and meditation sessions, lunch and learns, and last 
but not least, a Bike Clinic and Cycle Safety session to encourage 
people to cycle to work.
Through the Apprenticeship Levy we are supporting a number 
of staff to achieve professional qualifications in Management and 
Leadership, Digital Marketing and Data Analysis.
During the year we had many successes with The Lawyer 
winning the blue ribbon PPA Business Media Brand of the Year, 
Econsultancy winning Best technology partner for Marketing Week 
Mini MBA at the AOP Awards and Marketing Week winning ‘Digital 
Brand of the Year’.
Summary
We will continue to enforce our customer focus, enhance our 
products, and, simplify our operating structure.
Our investment into digital products and our improved overall 
revenue mix will enhance performance going forward and we remain 
confident that our strategy is building long-term value for  
our shareholders. 
These results and achievements would not have been possible 
without the full commitment and energy of every Centaurion. I am 
continuously impressed by the expertise of my colleagues across 
the Group. The levels of passion and deep knowledge of our 
content specialists and their commitment to innovate our products 
and services have been critical to enable such radical product 
transformations across the Group.
The ongoing success of Centaur relies on the ideas, the energy and 
our determination to deliver valuable solutions for our customers. 
Thank you to every Centaurion, to our shareholders, our readers 
and our customers. We look forward to continuing our work and 
providing valuable solutions throughout 2018.
