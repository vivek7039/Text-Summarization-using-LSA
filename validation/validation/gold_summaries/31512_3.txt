4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OVERVIEW
Chairman’s Statement
The Group delivered another strong operational 
and financial performance in 2017.
Profit before tax was $40.7m, compared to 
$34.2m in 2016. This 19% increase reflects 
a much lower exceptional charge of $0.5m 
(2016: $2.9m) showing tangible benefit 
from the successful completion of our 
pension de-risking exercise. Basic earnings 
per share increased by 18% to 103.15c.
The Group ended the year in good 
financial health with a cash balance of 
$30.8m (2016: $21.7m), again reflecting 
the low fixed capital requirements 
and efficient working capital 
characteristics of our business model.
We have a distinct cultural identity within 
4imprint, based on exacting standards 
of customer service. The professionalism 
and talent of our US team members 
was demonstrated to great effect as 
they helped our customers and affected 
suppliers to recover in the aftermath of 
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. I would like to 
thank each member of our dedicated team 
for their remarkable efforts during the year.
In several respects 2017 can be seen as 
a year of consolidation and the starting 
point of a transition for the Group. Our 
market position was strengthened, 
and our business model continued to 
generate profitable organic revenue 
growth. With our pension commitments 
much reduced, we have a firm and 
unencumbered financial base.
Turning to the future development of 
the Group, the Executive Team and the 
Board have considered, and subsequently 
evolved, our strategic framework. We 
have concluded that now is the right 
time to accelerate the awareness and 
strength of the 4imprint brand through 
a combination of different marketing 
techniques, including traditional broadcast 
media and the expansion of our advertising 
presence in digital media. This brand 
awareness component will complement 
our existing marketing engine, with the 
aim of delivering our new strategic goal of 
achieving $1bn in Group revenue by 2022.
We expect our business operations to 
remain highly cash generative. The cash 
demands from our legacy defined benefit 
pension obligations are now predictable, 
and small in the context of the financial 
strength of the Group. Accordingly, we 
have developed new balance sheet funding 
guidelines that will allow us to retain 
financial and operational flexibility through 
different economic cycles. A revised capital 
allocation approach has also been adopted. 
The first priority for our capital is clear: 
projects enhancing our ability to generate 
organic revenue growth. In addition, we 
have reconfirmed our commitment to both 
progressive regular dividends and to our 
remaining pension obligations. Finally, excess 
cash above these commitments is available 
for distribution to Shareholders.
In this context, the Board has 
recommended a non-recurring 
supplementary dividend of 60.00c per 
share. This will be paid in May 2018 in 
addition to, and at the same time as, 
the final dividend of 40.00c per share.
Our business operations are firmly 
established in attractive markets. The 
Group is financially strong and we 
have exciting plans for the future. 
Trading activity in the first few weeks 
of 2018 has been encouraging.
