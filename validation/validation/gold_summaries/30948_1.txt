Chief Executive Officer’s statement 2017 Performance
Global light vehicle production has a significant influence on 
our financial performance. In 2017, global light vehicle production 
volume increased in all markets except North America and 
reached 95.1 million vehicles, representing an increase of 2.1% 
compared to the same period the prior year. 
We continued to deliver revenue growth above global light 
vehicle production growth with solid profitability and cash flow 
generation. We generated revenue of €3,491 million (+5.4% at 
constant currency), Adjusted EBIT of €384 million (11.0% margin) 
and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of €119 million. 
We have continued to grow revenue in excess of global light 
vehicle production growth as a result of being a global market 
and technology leader in highly engineered automotive fluid 
systems, our strong customer relationships, and our global 
low cost manufacturing footprint including our wholly owned 
operations in China. We are well positioned with our products 
and process capabilities to benefit from the continuing demand 
for light vehicles and the megatrend of electrification.
Strategy update
The Group’s strategy of organic revenue growth, financial 
performance and focus on megatrends remains at the core 
of the business.
Continue with the Group’s market position strengths 
in key products 
We continue to be the #1 supplier of brake and fuel lines 
in all key regions globally and #3 supplier of plastic fuel tanks. 
Our customer and product focus has served to develop our 
strong market positions.
Together with our established global manufacturing footprint 
and level of vertical integration, we have achieved expansion 
by securing new business awards including on global vehicle 
platforms. This success is carrying through to our thermal 
management products, systems and plastic pressurised tank 
modules where we are strongly positioned for the HEV, EV 
and autonomous vehicle growth trends. 
Maintain balanced customer, platform, regional and 
product diversification 
With manufacturing facilities and assembly plants in 118 
locations across 28 countries and a balanced customer portfolio, 
we continue to mitigate the impact of regional market cyclicality 
and customer concentration.
In addition, our expertise across a range of fluid handling 
products has supported our ability to efficiently expand into 
complementary components and systems with high growth. 
We specifically target vehicles and platforms that support 
our strong diversification.
Continue enhancing the Group’s position as an advanced 
technology leader in automotive fluid systems to meet 
industry megatrend changes
We have continued to invest in R&D to develop products that 
facilitate our OEM customers meeting regulated emissions 
and fuel economy requirements. We have industry recognised 
innovation awards for plastic fuel tank technologies addressing 
emissions regulations and continue to see demand for our 
gasoline, diesel and turbocharger lines that support increasing 
regulatory requirements.
Continued focus on automotive megatrends
The growing HEV and EV market provides significant growth 
opportunities aligned with our strength in thermal management 
products and systems, plastic pressurised fuel tank modules 
and light weight (including nylon) materials.
Our addressable market could increase substantially especially 
for thermal management, given that EVs would typically require 
battery, chassis, electric motor and electronics thermal 
management (heating and cooling) in addition to traditional 
passenger cabin heating and cooling lines. Additional thermal 
management products and systems are expected for autonomous 
vehicles. We continue to pursue, with increasing confidence, 
organic HEV and EV opportunities with our existing customers 
on the larger volume EV programmes.
Our business model continues to be successful and we believe 
further progress can be achieved by meeting our goals in 2018.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Capitalise on the Group’s strong customer relationships, 
global footprint and excellent position in China 
With significant presence in all of the major geographies for 
OEM vehicle production and a well established global footprint 
within close proximity to OEM assembly facilities, we aim to 
be the supplier of choice on OEM global platforms.
A significant amount of our revenue was generated from OEM 
global platforms (i.e. platforms produced in three or more regions) 
and we expect this global platform growth trend to continue. 
19% of our 2017 revenue was from operations in China where we 
have a long established presence and wholly‑ owned operations.
Deliver strong growth, profitability and cash flow generation 
For a long period of time, this management team with the 
strength of our people worldwide has achieved excellent and 
consistent financial performance with strong revenue growth, 
profitability and cash flow generation. Our proven track record 
of financial performance has continued in 2017.
Looking ahead
As promised during the IPO, our dedicated team has continued 
to strengthen our global position by driving new technologies 
and products and enhancing our outstanding relationships with 
customers worldwide. The Group remains well placed to 
capitalise on the automotive megatrends of reduced emissions 
and improved fuel economy and we continue to have confidence 
that the trend towards HEV, EV and autonomous vehicles is 
positive for the Group.
We look forward to executing our plan and delivering attractive 
returns as a public company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
