 A STRONG GOVERNANCE CULTURE – KEY TO SUSTAINABLE SUCCESS
I am delighted that, building on the 
foundations laid in recent years,  
the Group has improved both its 
performance and financial position  
in 2017. This is particularly notable,  
in light of the challenging trading 
conditions that prevailed in the  
Middle East & India markets. 
As shown in the business review  
section of this report, the Group  
has made substantial progress on its 
strategic priorities. The board is pleased 
with the focus, energy and leadership 
that the executive team brings to  
the Group.
Chairman’s statement
John Connolly, Chairman
BOARD AREAS OF FOCUS IN 2017 
In my statement last year, I listed six areas of focus for 
the board. These were:
• Annual review of Group strategy and 
management’s execution of the strategy
• Induction and integration of new board members
• Board and management succession planning
• Monitoring business performance 
• Continued understanding of the Group’s businesses 
and management teams
• Maintaining emphasis on risk management and 
efficient structures 
We made good progress in all these areas and further 
information on the key areas of activities for the board 
in 2017 are set out in the governance report. 
Strong governance culture
Ensuring that G4S is resilient and agile and therefore 
able to deal with constant change and evolving 
economic and geo-political situations, is of paramount 
importance. This can only be achieved with a skilled  
and experienced board and management team and  
an appropriate culture and governance structure.
The board and I see strong governance, adapted to  
the Group’s needs, circumstances and business model, 
as a source of competitive advantage. G4S is a large, 
geographically diverse organisation, doing business in 
complex and sometimes sensitive environments. Sharing 
a common understanding of the company’s purpose and 
values is essential. To promote this, the board continues 
to support the application of G4S values throughout the 
organisation. A strong governance culture is supported 
by continuous monitoring, review and promotion of the 
Group’s values, standards and policies. It is also essential 
that directors feel able to provide not only support but 
also constructive challenge. 
Therefore we strive to foster open and effective 
communication within the boardroom and with the 
executive team. This process is informed by best 
practice as well as feedback received and views collated 
from our key stakeholders. There are a number of ways 
in which the board gathers stakeholders’ views, which 
are set out on pages 78 and 79. This year, as in previous 
years, I met with major shareholders as part of our 
annual programme of governance meetings. 
Given the business undertaken by the Group and the 
complex markets in which we operate, it is essential to 
understand the key risks faced by the organisation and 
to ensure that the company has appropriate policies, 
systems, processes and management action plans to 
mitigate these risks to an acceptable level. The board 
therefore maintains a Risk Committee, which is separate 
from the Audit Committee, to provide the necessary 
focus on risk management and mitigation.
Supporting change
Planning for the future requires us to review the board's 
composition regularly to ensure that it remains fit to 
support the changing needs of the Group. Management 
development and succession planning are also key areas of 
interest for the board. This was also particularly important 
this year, as management implemented important 
organisational changes, with the Secure Solutions business 
segment now organised into four regions and the creation 
of a global Cash Solutions division. 
In 2017, the board visited the Americas business and the 
technology business in the UK. Further details of these 
visits can be found on pages 78 and 79. In both 
instances, the board and I were impressed with the 
quality of the products and services offered and the 
importance of technology both in creating new services 
and also enhancing offerings when combined with 
traditional security and cash services. 
As chairman, it is my role to ensure that the board has 
the right skills to understand, support and challenge 
these developments. We give careful consideration  
66 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 to this need during the board members recruitment 
process but also when reviewing committees 
composition, as we did in December. I am confident 
that the board has significant, diverse and relevant skills 
and experience, with strong international exposure and 
knowledge of a significant number of industries (further 
information on the board balance is set out on page 74). 
Performance evaluation
Our externally facilitated performance evaluation was 
conducted between July and December 2017. The 
results confirmed that the board and its committees 
continue to operate well, with all directors contributing 
to the overall success of the Group. I led the 
performance evaluation process, with assistance from 
the Senior Independent Director and the company 
secretary. All the directors participated. The knowledge 
gained from the previous external evaluation allowed  
us to conduct a more focused evaluation this year. The 
board and committees performance review process is 
described in detail on page 77 and I am pleased to 
confirm that no significant issues were raised.
Changes to the board
Due to continued ill health, Ian Springett retired from 
the board on 20 June 2017. We were very sorry that 
Ian was unable to join our board and we wish him well 
for the future. Paul Spence, who was already a member 
of the Audit Committee, served as interim chair with 
effect from 20 January. I am very grateful to Paul for  
his strong stewardship. 
The Nomination Committee oversaw the process to 
find a new non-executive director qualified to act as 
chairman of the Audit Committee, which led to John 
Ramsay joining the board on 1 January 2018. I am 
pleased to welcome John, whose experience in highly 
international, innovation-focused businesses and his 
extensive background in finance and accounting will  
be very valuable to our board and in leading our  
Audit Committee. 
As announced in December 2017, after eight years  
on the board, Clare Spottiswoode will step down after 
the company’s annual general meeting on 15 May 2018. 
I would like to thank Clare for her thoughtful 
contributions to the board and her strong commitment, 
as chair of the CSR Committee since 2014, to help  
the company develop and promote CSR policies  
and processes. The Nomination Committee has initiated 
a search to find a new non-executive director to join 
the board. 
Further information about the work of the Nomination 
Committee during the year under review is set out on 
page 80.
Results
I am pleased to report on another year of good financial 
progress with continued growth in revenue and earnings 
and, importantly, a reduction in net debt with 
achievement of the Group’s leverage target of below 
2.5 times net debt to Adjusted EBITDA by the end  
of the year. 
Our statutory results showed a 3.1% increase in 
revenue, which rose to £7.8 billion, Adjusted PBITA  
up 6.5% to £491 million and earnings up 19.2% to  
£236 million benefiting primarily from a combination  
of profitable growth in our core businesses and profits 
on disposal of a number of businesses as our portfolio 
rationalisation programme drew to a close.
As noted elsewhere, our core businesses in all regions 
apart from the Middle East & India grew revenue and 
Adjusted PBITA such that total Group revenue from 
core businesses was up 3.2% to £7.4 billion and 
Adjusted PBITA grew by 4.2% to £496 million.
The management team’s continued focus on cash and 
working capital enabled the Group to deliver good 
operating cash flow conversion and this, coupled with 
net proceeds from disposal of a number of portfolio 
businesses of £156 million offset by organic capital 
investment of over £100 million, meant that the  
Group’s net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio reduced 
from 2.8 times at the end of 2016 to 2.4 times at the 
end of 2017, in line with the board’s stated leverage 
reduction target. 
The board is confident in the Group’s outlook and 
proposes to increase the final dividend by 5% to 6.11p 
(DKK 0.5097) per share, payable on 15 June 2018.  
With an interim dividend of 3.59p (DKK0.2948) paid  
on 13 October, this will bring the total dividend for  
the year to 9.70p per share. 
People
The Group has around 570,000 employees in over 90 
countries, often providing complex services in difficult 
environments. This can create significant challenges.  
It is therefore pleasing that the outcome of the 2017 
employee engagement survey, which consisted of 
questions relating to G4S’ new corporate values, 
provided an 84% favourable response rate. 
On behalf of the board, I wish to thank the employees 
of G4S for their engagement, enthusiasm, hard work 
and dedication.
