JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Chief Executive’s review
Nick Henry, Chief Executive Officer
Group strategy 
The Group’s strategy is to grow its 
business organically by leveraging 
its existing marine skill base in 
specialist expertise to a global market, 
supplemented by selective bolt-
on acquisitions which broaden the 
Group’s range of services, products or 
geographical coverage. Our strategic 
aim is to deliver long-term growth in 
earnings per share and consistently 
to increase shareholder value. Our 
businesses target an operating margin 
of at least 10%, a pre-tax return on 
capital employed of at least 15% and 
are expected to be cash-generative via 
careful management of working capital 
and investments. 
Whilst the Group prioritises organic 
growth, our strategy is to supplement it 
with value-enhancing acquisitions which 
fit into our existing divisions. James 
Fisher seeks to acquire businesses that 
have a niche product or service offering, 
with growth potential, a track record of 
profitability, cash generation and strong 
management. 
Business model
The Group’s businesses provide a range 
of marine services to large corporations 
and government bodies through its four 
divisions: Marine Support, Specialist 
Technical, Offshore Oil and Tankships. 
James Fisher’s businesses are 
entrepreneurially-led with a decentralised 
management structure which 
encourages managers to be responsible 
for making timely decisions in response 
to changes in the market and in the 
competitive environment. Many of the 
Group’s businesses operate in specialist 
niches and hold market-leading 
positions in their particular sector. Their 
growth is focused on the less mature 
markets around the world with 50% 
(2016: 51%) of the Group’s revenue 
derived from customers in the Middle 
East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are 
used to measure the success of the 
business model. These include revenue 
growth, operating margin (the ratio of 
underlying operating profit to revenue), 
return on capital employed and cash 
conversion. This year, revenue growth 
was 9% and the underlying operating 
margin increased to 11.0% (2016: 10.9%). 
The Group’ s post-tax return on capital 
employed was 12.2% (2016: 13.0%) and 
the reduction was due to the working 
capital requirement in relation to the 
contract to build two submarine rescue 
vessels for the Indian Navy. The Group’ s 
cash conversion, which measures the 
proportion of underlying operating profit 
that is turned into operating cash, was 
56% (2016: 103%) after adjustment for 
the investment in working capital for 
the submarine rescue project, which is 
expected to reverse in 2018 when the 
vessels are scheduled for delivery.
Strategic progress 
The Group’s corporate objectives are to 
deliver long-term growth in underlying 
earnings per share and to deliver 
progressive dividend growth. In 2017, 
underlying earnings per share grew by 
7% and the compound rate of growth 
over the last ten years in underlying 
earnings per share is 10%. Dividends 
have increased in each of the last 23 
years and the compound rate of dividend 
growth over the last ten years is 10%. 
Over the last few years, the Group has 
made a number of acquisitions of marine 
service businesses which have been 
integrated into James Fisher Marine 
Services (JFMS) to form a substantial 
offshore and subsea operator for the 
renewables industry. JFMS provides a 
wide range of services to the offshore 
wind and tidal sector to support both 
the construction and maintenance 
of this fast-growing industry. During 
2017 this range of services was further 
enhanced through the acquisition 
of Rotos 360 Limited (Rotos 360), a 
leading provider of blade repair services, 
and EDS HV Group Limited (EDS), the 
leading provider of high voltage cable 
connections and cable repair services. 
In March 2017, Rotos 360 was acquired 
for an initial £1.5m in cash, with a 
further potential £5.0m based on future 
profitability. The company repairs offshore 
wind farm rotor blades through innovative 
use of suspended work platforms and 
ultra violet resin curing techniques which 
reduce operational downtime.
In December 2017, EDS was acquired 
for an initial £9.0m with a potential 
further £5.6m based on profit targets 
over the next two years.  EDS operates  5

HMS Queen Elizabeth
Our Tankships business, James Fisher Everard (JFE), supported the initial sea trials of the first of a new class of aircraft 
carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, by providing refuelling services in July and August 2017. The Ministry of Defence 
determined that the most suitable port providing the level of security required for its largest-ever warship was the Port 
of Cromarty Firth, at Invergordon. Refuelling by road tanker would have been impractical, as it would have required 120 
lorries for each fuel stop.  
JFE swiftly relocated two tanker vessels, the M.V . Sarnia Cherie and the M.V . Sarnia Liberty, from the south coast of England to 
Scotland. Loaded with cargoes of F-76 fuel from the oil fuel depot in Gosport, Hampshire each vessel was weighed down at 
the stern due to the small, steeply shelving mooring berth at Invergordon and the need to counter the angle. Sister company 
Fendercare provided two 250 metre-lengths of 4” hose with associated connectors to maximise the rate of fuel transfer. 
Observing strict windows of time when the HMS Queen Elizabeth was available for refuelling, JFE completed two separate 
fuelling operations safely and efficiently whilst working to a tight and demanding deadline. This allowed the HMS Queen 
Elizabeth to fulfil its sea trials and return to its home port of Portsmouth for the commissioning ceremony. 
Nick Henry, Chief Executive Officer
in the high voltage sector providing 
cabling connection services to the 
offshore wind farms and, in 2017, was a 
significant supplier to the Rampion wind 
farm, off the south coast of the UK. 
JFMS’ first significant integrated 
marine services contract to support 
the construction of the Galloper wind 
farm, located 27km off the coast of 
Suffolk, UK, continued to progress 
well and the contract, worth in excess 
of £30m, is scheduled to complete in 
2018. In November 2017 the Group 
announced the award of a package of 
services to support the construction of 
the East Anglia One wind farm which is 
worth £3.1m, confirming its position as 
the leading integrated marine service 
provider to the offshore renewables 
sector.
Our Marine Support business, 
Fendercare, is the world leader in 
ship-to-ship transfers from a network 
of over 50 bases around the world, with 
a 20-year track record of conducting 
safe and efficient operations. In 2017, it 
commenced operations in the Santos 
basin, off the coast of Brazil, for two 
oil majors. This is a new market with 
significant potential for further growth. 
JFD, our Specialist Technical business 
and the world’s leading producer and 
operator of untethered submarine 
rescue systems, made good progress 
on the final engineering, assembly and 
testing of two submarine rescue vessels 
which are scheduled to be delivered 
to the Indian Navy in 2018. When the 
vessels’ sea trials are completed JFD 
will commence a 25-year contract to 
operate the service in India. Our strategy 
in this niche area continues to be to 
grow long-term service contracts, having 
supplied submarine rescue vessels of 
our design. JFD also operates submarine 
rescue services for NATO, the Singapore 
Navy and the Royal Australian Navy.
The business also progressed with two 
saturation diving systems for a Chinese 
salvage customer. JFD is a market 
leader in saturation diving and other 
diving equipment and the installation 
of its specialist diving systems leads 
to future demand for its products and 
for refurbishments or life extension to 
existing assets. 
The Group’s Tankships division continued 
its progress and increased earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation by 6% 
to £15.8m (2016: £14.9m). Its earnings 
and strong cash flow are utilised in the 
organic and acquisitive growth of the 
other three divisions. Tankships further 
progressed its fleet renewal programme 
by agreeing terms to lease and sell the 
Milford Fisher and replace it with a more 
modern second hand, 4kT vessel during 
the first quarter of 2018.
In Offshore Oil, after a slow start to the 
year, the market improvement seen  6
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Chief Executive’s review continued
in the early summer months failed to 
continue into the autumn. This meant 
that the market remained flat for the year 
and the backlog of maintenance work 
remains to be addressed. The Group’s 
competitive position in our various 
geographic markets remains strong and 
hence Offshore Oil is well-positioned 
for the upturn in market activity as and 
when this occurs. 
Divisional performance
Marine Support 2017 2016
Underlying operating profit (£m) 24.5 21.0 
Underlying operating margin 10.4% 10.3%
Return on capital  
employed 
15.5% 13.9%
Marine Support revenue was 16% 
higher in 2017 at £236.3m (2016: 
£203.6m). After adjusting for the 
beneficial impact of currency rates, 
the increase was 14%. Underlying 
operating profit increased by 17% to 
£24.5m due to strong performance at 
Fendercare, which initiated ship-to-ship 
(STS) transfer services in Brazil, good 
growth from Subtech in Africa and the 
Middle East, and further progress in the 
renewables sector.
STS transfer services commenced in 
Brazil in January 2017 for two oil majors 
and built up to become a significant 
operation by the end of the year. This 
offset a slightly softer market in the 
Asia Pacific and West African regions 
but drove overall STS revenue growth 
of 16% in the year. Our fendering 
and marine products business also 
produced double digit revenue growth 
and increased its profitability. 
Revenue at Subtech, which is 
headquartered in Durban, South 
Africa, increased by over 50%, having 
established a presence in the Middle 
East and having landed significant 
subsea projects in Ghana, Nigeria and 
Saudi Arabia to provide diving and cable 
laying services.
JFMS successfully continued to provide 
its wide range of integrated marine 
services to the Galloper wind farm 
construction project. Rotos 360 has 
completed over 70 wind turbine blade 
repairs on ten wind farms since it was 
acquired in March 2017. At the Lynn 
and Inner Dowsing offshore wind farm, 
it completed a full turnkey repair project 
to repair 27 turbines in a contract worth 
£3.4m.
Specialist Technical 2017 2016
Underlying operating profit (£m) 21.1 19.9
Underlying operating margin 13.6% 13.1%
Return on capital  
employed 
19.7% 27.8%
Revenue was 3% ahead of 2016 and 
underlying operating profit 6% ahead 
at £21.1m (2016: £19.9m). The market 
for UK nuclear decommissioning, which 
represents around one third of the 
division, continued to be challenging 
and resulted in marginally lower revenue, 
but this was offset by our specialist 
diving and submarine rescue business, 
JFD, which increased sales by 6%.
JFD made good progress in the design, 
assembly and testing of two submarine 
rescue vessels, which are due for delivery 
to the Indian Navy during 2018. The first 
vessel was substantially complete at 
the end of 2017 and has subsequently 
achieved acceptance testing at our 
Inchinnan site near Glasgow, UK. Delivery 
is scheduled for March 2018 and the 
second vessel is due to be delivered in 
November 2018.
JFD Australia supplied a Transfer 
Under Pressure unit and a hyperbaric 
equipment suite in support of the 
contract to manage submarine rescue 
operations for the Royal Australian Navy. 
The annual exercise to practice and 
prove established rescue procedures 
which took place off the coast of West 
Australia, was successfully completed 
in November. On 19 February 2018, the 
Group acquired Cowan Manufacturing 
Pty Limited, a business based in 
New South Wales, Australia, which 
designs and manufactures portable 
hyperbaric chambers primarily for the 
Royal Australian Navy and the wider 
international defence market. 
JFD also took part in a major 
international submarine rescue exercise, 
Dynamic Monarch 2017, which 
demonstrated the capabilities of the  7

NATO partner nations’ (France, Norway 
and UK) submarine rescue system and 
provided training. Dynamic Monarch, 
which took place in Turkey, is one of 
the largest international submarine 
rescue exercises, which occurs every 
three years, and is designed to test 
international forces’ inter-operability and 
ability to respond to submarines that 
have become disabled, anywhere in the 
world.
James Fisher Nuclear (JFN), our 
nuclear decommissioning business, 
achieved the design scheme completion 
milestone on the Winfrith core 
reactor decommissioning contract 
which commenced in 2016. On-site 
implementation is scheduled for 2018. 
In March, the first drone survey within 
Sellafield’s high security chemical 
separation area was completed, 
removing the need for scaffolding or 
special access vehicles, saving both 
time and money. However the business 
faced a slower market for new projects 
in its main UK markets.
Offshore Oil 2017 2016
Underlying operating profit (£m) 3.8 4.2
Underlying operating margin 6.7% 7.6%
Return on capital  
employed 
3.2% 3.5%
As reported at the half year, Offshore 
Oil had a slow start to the year, but 
business improved in the summer 
months. However, this improvement was 
not maintained into the autumn.
Revenue was 2% higher at £56.4m 
but after adjusting for the impact of 
exchange rates, sales were 1% lower. 
In the second half of 2017, revenue 
at constant currency was 4% higher 
than the 2016 comparator. Underlying 
operating profit was £0.4m lower in 
2017 at £3.8m (2016: £4.2m) but more 
than two times greater than the first half 
of the year.
Our Norwegian business, Scan Tech 
AS’ successfully completed the 
lifting package project for the Johan 
Sverdrup field which has contributed 
around £5.0m of revenue to date. 
RMSpumptools, our artificial lift 
company, had a steadily improving order 
book over the year and a strong finish 
to 2017.
Tankships 2017 2016
Underlying operating profit (£m) 8.8 8.2
Underlying operating margin 15.4% 14.8%
Return on capital  
employed 
34.2% 31.9%
Tankships continued its recent track 
record of profitability and strong 
cash generation. On similar revenue, 
underlying operating profit was 7% 
ahead of 2016 at £8.8m (2016: £8.2m) 
and cash generation was once again 
very strong.
The business, which distributes clean 
petroleum products around the northern 
European coastline, maintained high 
vessel utilisation and tight control of 
costs and continued its excellent track 
record of carrying out its operations 
to high standards of health and safety. 
In July and August, two of its vessels 
supported the sea trials of HMS Queen 
Elizabeth, the UK Navy’s largest aircraft 
carrier, by providing refuelling services 
in Invergordon, Scotland. The business 
responded quickly and pragmatically by 
deploying two vessels from the south 
coast of the UK, to support its customer.
Maputo project, Mozambique
Subtech, the Group’s Durban headquartered marine service 
company, completed a major quay offset project in the Port of 
Maputo in Mozambique. The project, which enabled other 
infrastructure projects at the port, involved the installation and 
commissioning of the new fender support structures and new 
fender spacing systems, within a 19 day shutdown period of the 
existing quay. The quay was extended and deepened to enable 
it to accommodate a fully-laden Panamex vessel. The first such 
vessel was successfully berthed three days after the quay was 
reopened in July 2017.
