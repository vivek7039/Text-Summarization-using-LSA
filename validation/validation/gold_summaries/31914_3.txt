 4 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement
Further detail on strategic progress is outlined 
throughout this Annual Report and is intended to be 
detailed to investors and analysts at investor briefings 
in October 2017.
Acquisition of Danlind a/s
On 4 September 2017, the Group announced the 
proposed acquisition of the entire share capital of 
Danlind a/s, a supplier of auto dishwash and laundry 
products, based in Denmark. Danlind provides 
McBride with access to accelerated growth in the key 
strategic category of auto dishwash tablets, through 
its well-invested capacity, technology platform and 
high quality product range. Danlind has a significant 
range of retail and contract customers along with a 
well-established position in the Nordic region and in 
the commercial laundry and dishwash markets. Danlind 
will enable McBride to gain entry into growth segments 
where it is currently under-represented. Additionally, 
Danlind’s strong position in Ecolabel products can 
be developed further through McBride’s extensive 
European reach. 
Danlind operates from three manufacturing sites in 
Denmark, and has approximately 250 employees. For the 
year ended 31 December 2016, Danlind reported revenues 
of £58.4 million, EBITDA of £1.6 million, a loss before 
tax of £1.3 million, and had gross assets of £48.0 million 
as at 31 December 2016. For its financial year ending 
31 December 2017, on a standalone basis, Danlind is 
currently expected to generate c.£2.5 million of EBITDA. 
McBride expects to realise significant commercial, 
technical and operational improvement synergies 
from the acquisition. The acquisition is expected to be 
immediately earnings enhancing for the Group. Post-tax 
return on invested capital is expected to meet cost of 
capital in the third full year of ownership.
Consideration of £10.8 million will be payable to 
the shareholder of Danlind, Lind Holdings ApS, and 
c.£28 million of net debt in Danlind will be assumed by 
McBride at completion. The acquisition will be funded 
from McBride’s existing banking facilities.
The acquisition, which is subject to customary 
regulatory and closing conditions, is expected to 
complete in early October 2017.
On completion, Danlind, the management team 
and its employees will form part of the Household 
products segment. 
Results
The past year has demonstrated further progress in 
the quality of the Group’s profits and a step closer to 
our medium-term profitability ambitions. Underlying 
revenues for the year were lower by 3.8% in constant 
currency terms, with a further 2.1% reduction a result of 
the deliberate action to simplify the customer portfolio. 
In spite of this revenue decline, adjusted profits before 
tax increased to £34.6 million (2016: £29.4m) with 
adjusted operating profit margins moving up to 5.9% 
(2016: 5.3%), a near doubling compared to the 3.0% in 
2014. Reported operating profit increased by 21% on 
prior year with reported profits before tax decreasing to 
£19.2 million (2016: £25.8m) primarily due to exceptional 
costs incurred as part of the Group refinancing. 
A business active in a change 
programme whilst delivering 
a progressively more 
sustainable financial position.
Dear Shareholder
Welcome to the 2017 Annual Report, which reviews the 
past twelve months – my first full year as your Chairman.
The business has delivered another strong year of 
progress towards our medium-term ambitions and 
progressed extensively in the first months of the 
‘Prepare’ phase of the ‘Repair, Prepare, Grow’ strategy. 
This report demonstrates a business active in a change 
programme whilst delivering a progressively more 
sustainable financial position.
Strategic progress
We outlined at the interim stage that the Group was 
closing out the ‘Repair’ phase of the transformation 
strategy. The Group has been busy with ‘Prepare’ 
actions in the meantime. These include key activities 
in the development of the sales growth plan, covering 
both organic development and possible acquisition 
opportunities in markets and categories. Support 
actions for this growth have been developed, including 
in particular the capital expenditure required to ensure 
our manufacturing platform is to the capacity and 
standard required. The commercial plan and outline 
capital programme were reviewed by the Board during 
an engaging and challenging two-day session with 
the executive and senior managers. The key ‘Prepare’ 
action relating to improving organisation and people 
development is now under way and will continue to 
adapt as we progress into the ‘Grow’ phase.  5 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
The loss of contribution from the targeted customer 
and product rationalisation programme started in 
the 2016 financial year has facilitated significant cost 
reduction from the ensuing simplification. With raw 
material pressures in the second half and market 
conditions meaning wholesale price increases are 
not feasible; the business has delivered savings from 
product engineering and further reductions across all 
cost categories. At the back end of the financial year, 
the Group reset its financing arrangements with the 
outstanding US$ Private Placement lending replaced 
by a new five-year credit facility, providing the Group 
with significantly lower borrowing costs going forward 
and five-year funding certainty in support of the 
‘Grow’ phase. 
Payments to shareholders
In September 2015, the Board reset its policy concerning 
payments to shareholders. During the period of the 
‘Repair’ phase, the payment was held at 3.6 pence per 
share, now that we have exited this phase and in light 
of the improved financial performance of the Company, 
the Board will recommend to increase the payment to 
shareholders to 4.3 pence per share. This represents a 
19% increase and brings the payment in line with our 
policy of a dividend cover range of 2x-3x, taking into 
account funding availability.
Brexit
McBride is a European business. Exit from the EU has 
potential implications in a number of areas of McBride’s 
activities. These include chemical and other regulatory 
policies, tariffs, currency volatility and availability of 
staff. A number of colleagues at McBride have migrated 
to the UK from elsewhere in the EU for employment 
purposes and are valued members of the business. 
We urge Governments to quickly clarify the uncertainty 
over their right to remain in the UK and the timing of 
any changes to the current free market situation.
Governance
The Board remains focused on ensuring that the UK 
Corporate Governance Code’s principles of leadership 
and board effectiveness are applied. My introduction to 
the Corporate governance report on page 35 sets out 
how the Board has complied with the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (‘the Code’) which 
applied throughout the financial year ended 30 June 2017.
Board
There have been no changes to the Board during the year. 
I would like to express my thanks to my fellow Board 
members for their valuable contribution over the past year.
Our people
Our employees are certainly our most important asset, 
and the opportunities for long-term growth within the 
Group will ensure that they find McBride a place where 
they will continue to enjoy rewarding careers. The Board 
would like to welcome all new colleagues who have 
joined the Group, thank everyone who has contributed 
to what has been yet another successful year and look 
forward to their continued contribution in achieving our 
strategy going forward.
Current trading and outlook
The Group has made a satisfactory start to the new 
financial year. Markets continue to demonstrate varied 
dynamics with stable core demand. Raw material pricing 
pressures continue as the Group remains determined 
to drive its cost base still lower. The capital programme 
is in full flow and the benefits of these programmes 
will position the Group well in its chosen categories, 
channels and territories. My Board colleagues and 
I are confident on the delivery of the new strategy.
