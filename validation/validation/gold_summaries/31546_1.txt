Group results
Our Group revenues have increased by 9.4%  
to £623.9 million for the year to 30 November 
2017 (2016: £570.2 million). Underlying EBIT* 
has increased by 17.4% to £48.5 million  
(2016: £41.3 million) whilst operating profit 
decreased by 1% to £26.6m (2016: £26.8m).
I am extremely pleased with the significant 
progress we’ve made in our first year as an 
AIM listed company in terms of delivering our 
commitments and strategy in our targeted 
sectors of Retail, Consumer, Manufacturing, 
Industrial and Bulk and E-commerce.
Effective implementation of our business 
strategy has been key to our success and I am 
proud of what we’ve delivered through the 
platform of our unique network and consulting-
led approach. 
Eddie Stobart focuses on providing cost-
effective innovative logistics solutions to our 
customers across the supply chain. In my 30 
years within the retail industry, I have become 
acutely aware of the importance of building 
and developing close working relationships 
with customers.
We invest in our customer relationships to 
ensure we deliver high levels of customer 
service and provide innovative solutions in  
a rapidly developing market. 
During the year, we have continued to grow 
through new customer wins and renewal of 
contracts with long-term existing customers  
in the four key sectors in which we operate. 
In April we acquired iForce, an e-fulfilment 
specialist, providing a comprehensive 
e-commerce offer to a wide range of retailers.
 
We also acquired control of Speedy Freight a 
same day business-to-business freight service, 
through the purchase of 50% of its shares. 
Both of these acquisitions have broadened our 
service offering and capabilities, enabling us to 
provide new services to existing customers, as 
well as win new customers. As a result of these 
acquisitions we have also benefitted from a 
number of cross-selling opportunities.
To support our development within our key 
strategic growth sectors, we have recruited 
new people into the business to help deliver 
excellent service levels to our customers. 
We are also investing in industry-leading 
technology and equipment needed to continue 
to provide advanced supply chain operations 
to our blue-chip customers in the rapidly 
developing logistics market. 
Operational performance 
In order to deliver growth, our operations  
team has had to flex and continually review  
the network, ensuring we are able to deliver  
the high levels of service that our  
customers demand. 
In addition, all of our people have needed to 
develop new skills and embrace changes in 
the way we operate, as we simplify ways of 
working and at the same time, take on new and 
exciting contracts which demand more 
complex solutions. 
The acquisition of iForce brought new 
customers in the E-commerce sector, 
contributing to our significant increase in 
revenue of 111% to £103.4 million in the year 
(2016: £49.1 million). 
We have seen good growth in our more 
established Retail operations, where we are 
now working with the majority of the UK’s top 
five retailers.
Our MIB sector is now our largest segment  
and has also seen significant growth during  
the year of 37% to £182.0 million (2016: 
£132.7million). This has been delivered through 
a combination of the full year effect of 2016 
contract wins, as well as organic growth with 
existing new contract wins through the period. 
Within Consumer, revenues in the year were 
down by 12% to £144.6 million (2016: £164.6 
million). This was due to the loss of one 
significant contract, which I am now pleased  
to say has been successfully re-secured. 
The business has achieved a number of high 
profile contract wins during the year and we are 
proud of the new customer relationships we 
have recently started.
Adding to these wins, we are delighted to have 
renewed a number of contracts within our 
existing portfolio of blue-chip customers, worth 
an estimated £41 million and secured a further 
£89 million of new volume with new and 
existing customers.
Furthermore, we have integrated our under-
performing ports business into the wider 
transport network in order to improve utilisation 
and profitability.
Software and technology
We recognise the critical role that systems and 
technology play in the modern supply chain.  
In 2017 we made further investments in our 
technology capability across our business, 
both operational and back-office.

We continue to invest in the best available tools 
and systems to simplify ways of working, 
improve efficiency and ensure our people are 
well equipped to deliver service excellence. 
This has included the successful replacement 
of the in-vehicle systems and telemetry 
throughout the entire Eddie Stobart vehicle 
fleet, delivering industry-leading, custom-
designed equipment and software.
 
Our acquisition of iForce now allows us to 
include leading E-commerce software as part 
of our service offering. The iForce system offers 
customers a full end-to-end supply chain 
solution which is modular in design allowing 
customers to use all or part of the solutions  
on offer.
As we move forward, our ongoing system 
development programme is designed to 
streamline and simplify our operations, keeping 
us at the forefront of the industry in delivering 
service excellence and advanced end-to-end 
supply chain solutions. 
Brand update
Since listing in April 2017, our brand licencing 
arrangement with Stobart Group has not 
changed, with the present financial 
arrangements ending in February 2020.
We have options beyond 2020 to continue our 
licencing arrangements;
• Pay £3 million a year for continued use  
of the licence
• Purchase a perpetual licence for £15 million 
for use in the logistics market
• Purchase a perpetual licence for £50 million 
for unrestricted use
The team at Eddie Stobart is passionate about 
our name and the leading brand. However, we 
also recognise that following the introduction of 
our new strategy and the recent acquisitions,  
we need to review our position given the 
broader range of supply chain services we  
now offer.
The Board is committed to reviewing all options 
and we will ensure we consider the views and 
interests of our people, customers and 
shareholders before deciding on the best  
way forward.
People
The commitment of the leadership team and the 
engagement and support from all employees 
has been key to our success in delivering our 
plans. I would like to thank the whole team for 
their enthusiasm and dedication, without which 
our listing on AIM and these results would not 
have been possible. 
The market today is very different to a few 
years ago due to the shift in retail shopping 
habits and the advent of online shopping. This 
has resulted in our customers looking for more 
than the traditional support from their logistics 
providers. 
Our staff are now required not only to 
understand their own roles within the 
organisation but also what is important to 
specific customers. 
As a result, our people plan is focused on 
upskilling and developing our existing people, 
as well as attracting the best people across the 
industry to support our exciting growth agenda. 
Our Training Academy has been recognised as 
a leading facility by customers, suppliers and 
industry advocates. Opening up our services 
supports our wider strategy to supply skilled 
drivers and warehouse operatives to 
businesses through their supply chain  
resource services.
In 2017, we expanded the commercial offering 
of our training to the wider market, opening up 
a second Training Academy just outside Rugby 
in the Midlands, complementing our existing 
facility in Warrington.
We are pleased with our progress this year and 
as a result, we are well placed to continue with 
our growth strategy in the year ahead.
