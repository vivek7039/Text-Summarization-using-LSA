Voyager Software division
Voyager Software itself became a part of the 
Dillistone Group in September 2011. It has 
always provided end-to-end recruitment 
solutions to the recruitment sector, typically 
those working on a contingency basis, and 
continues to do so to this day. In September 
2012, Voyager Software launched its latest 
generation of recruitment solutions with its 
Infinity product. Infinity is designed to improve 
the performance and efficiency of recruitment 
businesses specialising in permanent, contract 
and temporary roles. With automation at its 
heart, it meets the demands of flexibility and 
functionality required by these recruitment 
firms. Alongside Voyager Software’s VDQ 
product, for pure fast paced temporary 
agencies, and Mid-Office, the pay-and-bill 
solution for the back office, the business covers 
the whole contingency recruitment space. 
In 2013, the Group acquired FCP Internet, 
suppliers of the evolve™ SaaS product, and 
this has subsequently been integrated into the 
Voyager Software Division. In October 2014,  
a further acquisition, ISV Software – a  
supplier of skills testing and training  
services, was also incorporated into the 
Division. Today, the Voyager Software Division’s 
products are used in over 20 different countries 
by many thousands of users in different-sized 
recruitment businesses. The Division has 
offices in the UK and Australia and employs 
around 60 people.
