our strengths
Chief Executive Officer’s review
2017 saw a further year of profitable growth 
for the Group with increased contributions 
from the Bilco and Giesse acquisitions, 
and continued favourable exchange rates 
on translation.
Footprint projects in each of the Divisions 
progressed well such that the Group has the 
safe, modern and flexible facilities necessary 
to support our customers’ needs, increase 
our product quality and improve our 
service levels. 
Reported Revenue and Underlying 
Operating Profit increased by 14.2 and 
10.0 per cent respectively, principally due 
to the Bilco and Giesse acquisitions and 
favourable exchange rates on translation. 
On a constant currency like for like basis, 
Revenue increased by 1.7 per cent in the 
year and Underlying Operating Profit 
decreased by 1.5 per cent.
Cash generation was lower than in recent 
years  due to targeted investment in working 
capital and continued investment in the 
balance sheet, including gross capital 
expenditure at 1.27x Depreciation. The 
Group remains cash generative and 
Leverage at the year end of 1.83x was again 
comfortably back within the Group’s core 
year-end target range of 1.50x to 2.00x.
ROCE decreased slightly in the year to 
13.6 per cent, with the Group continuing 
to target achieving a ROCE of 15.0 per cent 
over the medium term.
The Group has again demonstrated its resilience 
in producing a solid set of results.

2018 priorities
Tyman’s key priorities for 2018 are an 
extension of the themes that the Group has 
developed over the past few years and include:
1. Health and safety
The Group’s health and safety performance 
in the past two years has been disappointing, 
despite the significant investment made in 
both time and resources dedicated to health 
and safety functions in each Division.
Securing a demonstrable improvement to 
the Group’s health and safety record in 2018 
is regarded by the Board as being of the 
highest importance. 2018 will see further 
investment made in employee training, the 
development of safer working practices, 
additional capital investment and sharing 
of best practice across Divisions. 
2. Footprint
Tyman made significant changes to its 
footprint in 2017 in each of its Divisions such 
that the Group has safe, modern and flexible 
facilities necessary to support customers’ 
needs, increase product quality and improve 
service levels. 
2018 will see the completion of moves into 
the new facilities in the UK and US and the 
exit from two significant sites in North America. 
Successful management of these moves, 
with minimal operational disruption to the 
businesses, will be a key priority for the 
Group during the year.
3. Group collaboration
The Group has successfully established 
inter-Divisional teams in the areas of health 
and safety, risk management and supply 
chain through TSA. Cross selling of other 
Divisions’ products continued to gain traction 
most notably with the Giesse products in 
North American and UK markets.
Encouraging effective communication, 
consistency of approach, sharing of best 
practice and standards of operational 
excellence across each of the Divisions 
remains a focus in 2018. 
4. Financial objectives 
A return to like for like Revenue growth 
and margin expansion in each Division, 
underpinned by working capital discipline 
and cash generation to enable the Group 
to make further progress towards its 
committed medium term ROCE target 
of 15.0 per cent.
Input cost inflation pressures in 2018 will 
be managed through a combination of 
effective purchasing, price management 
and cost reduction programmes.
5. Self‑help initiatives
Continuing with the Group’s well established 
self-help initiatives to improve the businesses, 
in particular in the areas of new product 
development, people, supply chain and 
capital projects with a focus on automation 
and lean manufacturing to ensure Tyman 
differentiates itself from the competition 
and continues to grow market share.
6. M&A
Pursuing the Group’s active acquisition 
programme, prioritising hardware and 
seals businesses in the UK and Europe 
and selecting emerging markets together 
with commercial hardware businesses 
in key end markets. 
7. Integration
The completion of the integration of Bilco 
and the start of the integration of Ashland 
Hardware into AmesburyTruth.
Tyman expects to see a further 
year of profitable growth.”

Outlook
AmesburyTruth expects US residential and 
commercial markets will show growth in 
2018, possibly assisted by increasing real 
wages as the changes to the US tax code 
become established. The Canadian market 
for the Division’s products is expected to 
show further growth, although at a slower 
rate than was seen in 2017. 
AmesburyTruth is well placed to capture the 
opportunities that exist in 2018, and expects 
to see market share recovery among smaller 
customers, like for like sales growth and a 
return to margin expansion during the year.
ERA expects that UK residential RMI 
demand will continue to be slow in 2018 
and, as a consequence, expects that the 
market will contract to a similar extent to 
2017. Given the subdued market backdrop 
ERA’s focus will be on further share gains, 
leveraging the opportunities offered by 
ERA’s new facility, new product introductions 
and management of costs and overheads. 
The outlook for ERA’s commercial and light 
infrastructure products remains promising 
in 2018.
SchlegelGiesse expects that Continental 
European markets will show broad-based 
incremental growth in 2018 and is well placed 
to take further market share. The second 
half momentum established in the Middle 
East and Latin America is expected to continue, 
with key Brazilian and Argentine markets 
recovering. China and Asia Pacific markets 
are likely to remain variable with opportunities 
for growth in certain countries. 
Volumes in 2018 to date are in line with 
expectations and there is a promising order 
book in each Division. Tyman expects to see 
a further year of profitable growth in 2018.
