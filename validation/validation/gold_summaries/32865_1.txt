Overview
I am pleased to present the Sanne Group plc’s 
Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Performance
SANNE has delivered a strong set of financial 
results in 2017. Total revenues increased by 77% 
overall, with organic revenue growth of 14%. The 
Group’s underlying operating profit increased by 
76% to £38.8 million.  Operating profit was £23.1 
million. Underlying profit before tax increased by 
79% to £38.1 million. Profit before tax was £22.4 
million. The Group’s underlying operating profit 
margin was 34.3%. 
The underlying diluted EPS was 23.7 pence (2016: 
16.9 pence). 
Increased dividend
The Board continues to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy, subject always to maintaining a 
sufficient level of dividend cover. It still expects to 
retain sufficient capital to fund ongoing operating 
requirements and to invest in the Group’s long-
term growth. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 8.4 
pence per ordinary share (2016: 6.4 pence). The 
final dividend will be payable on 15 May 2018 to 
Shareholders on the register at close of business 
on 3 April 2018.
Together with the previously paid 2017 interim 
dividend of 4.2 pence per share, this gives a total 
dividend for the year of 12.6 pence per share 
(2016: 9.6 pence in total).
Business development
SANNE has continued to evolve as an organisation, 
integrating acquisitions and emerging with 
a regional and global business model. This 
places the Group in a strong position to address 
worldwide opportunities as it builds a sustainable 
global business. Further, the business continues 
to invest significantly in staff training and group 
services functions, strengthening its procedures.
The alternative fund administration market 
continues to expand, offering good prospects for 
the Group. Increasing and changing regulations 
are difficult to deal with in-house and outsourcing 
the administration of this to a specialist provider 
with a global footprint such as SANNE becomes an 
ever more attractive proposition.
2017 was a year of group-wide consolidation, 
and significant work has been undertaken to 
strengthen procedures and controls. SANNE’s 
2016 acquisitions have been largely integrated 
into the business, offering an expanded global 
reach. The Company re-invested in 2017 and 
into 2018, in internal support, within the control 
functions and in bolstering the first and second 
lines of defence. Additional investment has also 
been made in staff training and in standardising 
our processes and procedures. This underpins our 
strategy of a compliance culture.
SANNE completed the acquisition of the Mauritian 
business, International Financial Services Limited 
and IFS Trustees (together IFS) on 1 January 2017, 
and increased its Luxembourg presence with the 
acquisitions of Luxembourg Investment Solutions 
S.A. (LIS) and Compliance Partners S.A. (CP) on 6 
February 2018.
Corporate governance
During the year the Board has further developed 
its corporate governance. The Nomination 
Committee was evolved into the Nomination 
and Governance Committee, and it was decided 
to split the Audit and Risk Committee into two 
separate committees. The corporate governance 
framework needs to support processes and create 
a strong tone from the top. The strengthening 
of our framework will help the Company build 
its business and support sustainable growth. 
More information is provided on our corporate 
governance in the Director’s Report on pages 
47 to 49. In addition, on pages 42 to 47 there is 
a report on how SANNE complies with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
In 2017, the Board and the Committees 
had an external effectiveness review. The 
conclusions from the review were useful and its 
recommendations have been accepted.

Our people
I would like to thank everyone, on behalf of the 
Board, for their hard work and contribution to 
the Group’s 2017 performance. There is more 
information on our people, diversity and inclusion 
on pages 27 and 51.
Our role in society
In this year’s report there is included for the first 
time a section on Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR). SANNE supports the charitable efforts of 
staff around the Group and its strategy focusses 
on three core CSR themes; benefiting children, 
fighting poverty and supporting education. 
The Committees and the Board have discussed 
gender pay, diversity and inclusion.  The Board 
has reviewed gender pay and is looking to ensure 
internal procedures are enhanced to ensure all 
staff are treated equally. 
The Company is keen to ensure that its 
environmental impact is minimised and takes 
a number of steps to seek to reduce its carbon 
footprint, by encouraging the use of conference 
calls to reduce travel, recycling materials and 
selecting new offices that are built with the 
environment in mind.
Our culture
SANNE has a strong collegiate culture, which 
encourages entrepreneurial drive. In 2017 (and 
early 2018) the Company introduced further 
training to optimise its compliance and control 
processes at the centre of our business. SANNE 
has also built its assurance capability further in 
2017 and early 2018 to maintain focus in this area. 
Board membership
Spencer Daley, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), is to 
take on the role of Head of M&A and Strategy, 
with responsibility for helping the Group explore 
and maximise strategic opportunities, both 
organic and inorganic. Spencer will be succeeded 
as CFO by James Ireland.
I am delighted that James is joining SANNE as CFO 
as Spencer’s successor. He has worked very closely 
with both Dean Godwin, SANNE’s Chief Executive 
Officer, and Spencer for a number of years, and 
engaged well with the broader management team 
and Board at SANNE. His background will be a 
great asset in helping the business to deliver its 
future development and global growth plans.
James joins SANNE from Investec, where he has 
been for over 10 years, advising public and private 
companies on mergers and acquisitions and 
equity capital markets transactions. James has 
acted as a board-level adviser to a broad range of 
businesses including internationally diverse groups 
with a significant emphasis on human capital for 
their service delivery. Most recently he has been 
the head of Investec’s Support Services sector 
team which includes the fund and corporate 
administration services sector. He is expected to 
join the Board as CFO in June 2018, at which point 
Spencer will step down from the Board.
Mel Carvill was welcomed to the Board on 1 
January 2018. Currently based in Guernsey, 
Mel brings global financial services and risk 
management experience accumulated from his 
time at Generali and more recently at PPF Group. 
He will serve as Chairman of the newly constituted 
Risk Committee.
Phil Godley stepped down from the Board on 
1 January 2018. Phil's business leadership and 
valuable contribution to the Board have hugely 
supported SANNE through its launch on the stock 
market and in the period since.
Outlook
SANNE has had a year of progress with strong 
financial results. Our longer-term prospects 
are driven by the strong growth in the global 
alternatives market. The increase in workloads of 
asset managers creates additional administration 
that SANNE can manage as an outsourced 
solution with our international footprint. Looking 
forward we are building on our success as a high 
growth sustainable business whilst investing in 
our infrastructure. Against this background, the 
outlook for 2018 continues to look promising.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
“Strategic 
recruitment of 
talent and increased 
jurisdictional 
presence have helped 
us to deliver high 
quality professional 
services.”
Dean Godwin 
  r
Our vision
SANNE’s vision is to be one of the world’s leading 
providers of alternative asset and corporate 
administrative services. We have been driving to 
achieve this through building a sustainable global 
business based on best practice, professionalism, 
ambition, integrity and engagement. Strategic 
recruitment of talent and increased jurisdictional 
presence have helped us to deliver high quality 
professional services. 
The aim is to deliver services to a range of 
international, institutional and private client 
customers. SANNE seeks to ensure excellent client 
service, based on our organisational values of 
professionalism and integrity.
Our markets
Our focus is to continue to build scale in 
established and emerging markets in order that 
we can deliver global solutions to new and existing 
clients. We continue to see the trend towards the 
outsourcing of corporate and fund administration 
activity from institutions and asset managers to 
ease administration and to have independent 
oversight. We provide administration services for 
alternatives and due to greater outsourcing, partly 
as a result of a changing regulatory environment, 
demand is increasing. There is more detail on 
our business model on pages 8 to 9 and on our 
segmental reporting on pages 16 to 20.
Brexit
The impact of Brexit in the market is unlikely to 
damage global demand for services, however we 
anticipate that our offices in Dublin, Luxembourg, 
Malta and the Netherlands are likely to benefit 
from any potential increase in demand. Our recent 
acquisition of Luxembourg Investment Solutions 
S.A. and Compliance Partners S.A. has further 
strengthened our EU footprint.
2017
During the year we have focused on ensuring our 
business model is built for expansion. We have 
recruited new talent in client and group services 
and invested in infrastructure. At the same time 
we have consolidated our processes and boosted 
our back office functions.
We have further developed the three lines of 
defence, ensuring we have specialist compliance 
personnel working with the business in 
conjunction with the checks and balances from 
the second line of defence in Risk and Compliance 
and Internal Audit (the third line). In addition, we 
have internal financial controls in place to protect 
SANNE and our clients. Details of our approach 
to controls can be found in the Risk Management 
Report on pages 22 to 26 and in the Report of the 
Audit and Risk Committee on pages 52 to 56.
SANNE has had a successful year and highlights 
include the acquisition of our new Mauritian 
business, IFS. After the year-end we also finalised 
the acquisition of Luxembourg Investment 
Solutions S.A. and Compliance Partners S.A. on 6 
February 2018. These businesses have expanded 
our expertise and jurisdictional coverage.
Senior Management
Further to the CFO announcement today, I am 
pleased to welcome James Ireland, who will join 
us in June, as the new CFO. It is recognised that 
Spencer is an important part of the SANNE’s 
success story. He has been instrumental in helping 
IPO the Group in 2015 and has played a key role 
in the strong growth of the business over the 
past five years. His entrepreneurial spirit is ideally 
suited to his new role, Head of M&A and Strategy, 
as the business looks forward to capturing the 
opportunities that lie ahead.
On 1 January 2018 Phil Godley stepped down from 
the Board. I wish to thank Phil for his contribution 
to the Board. 
There were a number of key internal promotions 
over the past year that strengthened the SANNE 
management team:
• Martin Schnaier was promoted into the role 
of Chief Commercial Officer.
• Sean Murray was appointed as the Managing 
Director for EMEA Alternatives, previously 
held by Martin Schnaier. 
• Mark Law joined on 14 August 2017 to lead 
our Asia-Pacific & Mauritius business. He is 
based in Hong Kong.
