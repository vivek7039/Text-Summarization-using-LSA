 2017 saw the Group deliver strong 
growth and strategic progress by 
being proactive and leveraging our 
leadership positions in increasingly 
attractive markets.
Strategic progress
People
Safety is our number one priority and  
I am pleased to report excellent progress 
in the past year. The Group’s total incident 
rate (TIR), our primary measure of safety 
performance, reduced from 0.66 to 0.53, 
a 20% improvement. This has been 
achieved by a clear commitment from the 
top of the organisation through the Chief 
Executive’s Safety Committee and other 
initiatives, but more importantly by the 
widespread adoption of a bottom-up 
behavioural safety culture that focuses  
on reducing harm and ensuring our 
people have a safe start, safe finish and 
safe journey home. There are parts of  
the Group that consistently achieve zero 
harm, but we won’t be satisfied until that  
is consistent across all our businesses. 
In addition to improving safety, we  
have also re-invested in our people 
development programmes. This was  
an area where the business cut  
back during the downturn and it was 
important to rebuild in order to maintain 
our strong record of execution. Having 
leaders who can mentor and develop  
the potential of their teams is vital. The 
quality and passion of our people is a real 
differentiator for Weir and ensuring we 
have a highly skilled and fully engaged 
workforce is critical to our future success. 
Going forward, safety will continue to be 
our number one priority. We have also 
developed a new people strategy aimed 
at strengthening our culture and inspiring 
our people to reach their potential and 
build a personal legacy. It includes  
a new approach to strategic workforce 
planning and reviewing the employee 
experience to ensure it aligns with  
our culture and allows us to recruit and 
retain a diverse and vibrant workforce.
To help ensure our performance is fully 
aligned to the interests of our investors 
we’ll introduce an all-employee share 
ownership plan in 2019. The success of 
the Group depends on the efforts of all 
our people and it is right that we give 
them a real stake in our future. You can 
read further details of our proposed plan 
in our Remuneration Committee report 
from page 95.
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Delivering sustainable long-term performance
we have a good sense of where we  
want to go as a business and how we  
are going to get there. That includes 
agreeing new key performance indicators 
to be delivered over the medium term, 
starting in 2018. They are: 
• Improved sustainable engagement  
and organisational effectiveness
• Increased market share
• Improved percentage of revenues  
from new solutions
• Sustainably higher margins through  
the cycle
These indicators will guide our short-  
to medium-term progress and will  
require excellent execution of our 
strategy, building on the good  
progress delivered in 2017.
This time last year I set out our new 
‘We are Weir’ strategic framework. 
It gave the Group a clear future 
direction and articulated the distinctive 
competencies – People, Customers, 
Technology, and Performance – that 
will help Weir achieve our vision of 
being the most admired engineering 
business in our markets.
As 2017 progressed, ‘We are Weir’ gained 
real traction across the business with 
teams from all over the world contributing 
to a vibrant debate about how best to 
execute our new strategy and deliver 
strong returns for all our stakeholders. 
That passion and shared sense of 
purpose is extremely important and 
powerful. As we look to the future,

Executive 
Officer Customers
Our customers are the reason we exist 
and thrive. Every Weir colleague should 
wake up each day thinking how we can 
do more to help our customers do better. 
Traditionally, we have taken a product-led 
approach, but as part of the We are Weir 
strategic framework, we are moving to an 
integrated solutions mindset in which our 
people spend more time on site, listening 
to customers’ operational challenges and 
then designing a package of solutions to 
help them achieve their goals. 
This approach helps embed Weir  
even further into the operations of our 
customers and differentiates us more 
clearly from competitors. In Minerals, it 
helped increase orders ahead of global 
mining and sustaining capital spending. Oil 
& Gas also outperformed North American 
rig count growth, leveraging their key 
account management programme to build 
even closer relationships with leading 
oilfield services companies. Flow Control 
grew aftermarket orders in tough markets 
and reshaped its sales and marketing 
structure to increase its customer intimacy.
We will continue to build even closer 
customer relationships in the future, 
building on the competitive advantage 
provided by our comprehensive service 
network and seeking to continue to take 
early advantage of market trends. We  
will also work closely with customers  
to jointly develop new technologies  
that help them achieve their objectives 
and further embed Weir at the heart  
of their operations. 
You can read more in our divisional 
operational reviews beginning on  
page 28.
Technology
The Group delivered revenues of  
£168m from new solutions in 2017, a 
53% increase, as we continued to benefit 
from our commitment to research and 
development (R&D) during the downturns 
that affected both mining and oil and gas 
markets. We also made progress towards 
our aim of investing 2% of revenues in 
R&D with 2017 expenditure of £40m 
(2016: £27m) representing 1.7% of  
sales, up from 1.5% in 2016. Our next 
generation frac pump, the SPM
®
 QEM 
3000, is on trial with a number of the 
larger oilfield services companies, 
positioning the Group to benefit from  
any capital replacement cycle as frac 
fleets are upgraded in the future. 
The Group’s Internet of Things (IoT) 
technology, Synertrex
®
, was also 
successfully trialled in a number of 
regions, allowing customers to easily 
monitor the performance of their 
equipment and giving Weir valuable  
data to support future innovation. 
Alongside our established process of 
product development, the Group has 
developed a new technology strategy  
that will ensure we continue to lead  
the change in our markets and build  
on our legacy of innovative engineering.  
It includes increasing the digitisation  
of our solutions and operations, 
integrating advanced manufacturing into 
our factories, reinforcing our materials 
science leadership and developing ways 
to reduce our customers’ energy and 
water consumption; helping underpin  
the sustainability of our end markets.
Performance
Operational excellence has been a 
traditional strength of the Group and  
in 2017 we took important steps to 
reinvigorate our Value Chain Excellence 
(VCE) initiatives across the business. 
Reviews were conducted to assess  
the potential of every business unit  
to make improvements. 
More than 80 VCE projects were  
initiated, supported by extensive training 
programmes, and targeted at increasing 
on time delivery and reducing inventory 
turns. While overall working capital 
increased during the year as the business 
grew quickly, there was progress on 
increasing inventory turns. 
In 2018, we expect that progress to 
accelerate as we see some of the 
benefits of our renewed focus on 
operational excellence come through.  
In the longer term, we aim to significantly 
improve working capital performance 
supporting the Group’s ability to invest  
in further growth opportunities.
Capital allocation
In July, the Group acquired leading  
South East Asian wellhead manufacturer 
KOP Surface Products for an equivalent 
enterprise value of US$114m to support 
growth of our pressure control offering  
in the eastern hemisphere. KOP’s 
technology complements Weir’s  
existing Oil & Gas portfolio and will  
help accelerate progress in attractive 
Middle East and Asian markets. 
2017 markets and business review
The Group’s financial performance in 2017 
reflects the proactive approach taken by 
the business to act early and invest in 
extending our competitive advantages. 
This, coupled with rapid improvement  
in market conditions in North American  
oil and gas and increased investment  
by miners on brownfield assets, 
contributed to a 20% increase in  
constant currency orders.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The performance of the Oil & Gas  
division in particular was excellent. It 
moved from a £9m operating loss in  
2016 to an operating profit of £92m in  
2017. As the oil price and North American 
rig count recovered through the year, the 
division’s main manufacturing facility in  
Fort Worth, Texas, flexed its operations 
and significantly increased capacity, 
moving from one shift to three. As a 
result of previous reductions in fixed  
costs, the facility delivered excellent 
operating leverage that contributed  
to its overall performance.
Minerals delivered double-digit order 
growth as it captured opportunities  
in global mining markets. Alongside  
its integrated solutions strategy that 
delivered £67m in revenues, the division 
invested in additional sales and project 
engineers to support future growth,  
as confidence and quotation activity  
in mining markets increased. 
As orders grew there were some  
limited operational issues in the  
division as a result of plant and  
supply chain reconfigurations.  
While these were short-term, they, 
alongside the additional investment  
and some project delays, had an  
impact on the division’s operating  
margin, but it remained within its  
normal long-term range. 
Flow Control turned a corner in the 
second half of the year after its first  
half performance was impacted by  
tough market conditions in power and 
downstream oil and gas, while the 
division also recorded a one-off charge  
of £13m resulting from legacy contract 
challenges in its Gabbioneta business.  
This resulted in the division recording  
a small operating loss of £3m for the  
full year. As 2017 progressed, there  
were early signs of recovery in mid  
and downstream oil and gas markets 
while nuclear activity in China and  
South Korea continued to progress,  
with the division delivering good  
growth in its valves aftermarket  
business. After a restructuring of  
its sales and marketing capability,  
the division is now clearly focused on 
capturing future growth opportunities.

Outlook for 2018
Customers in our main markets are 
expected to increase investment in 2018 
with global mining expenditure expected 
to increase after a prolonged downturn. 
Investment by exploration and production 
companies in upstream North American 
markets is also expected to increase, 
supported by commodity prices and 
increased efficiencies in the industry. 
Power, mid and downstream oil  
and gas markets are showing initial  
indications of improvement. 
To fully benefit from these trends,  
the Group will leverage the four  
distinctive competencies at the  
heart of our strategic framework;  
People, Customers, Technology  
and Performance. 
Looking to 2018, assuming market 
conditions remain supportive, we  
expect to deliver strong constant  
currency revenue and profit growth  
and further balance sheet deleveraging.

Chief Executive Officer’s Q&A
Building a stronger legacy
Q 
What are your reflections on 
your first full year as Weir CEO?
The main highlight for me was the 
adoption of the We are Weir strategy. 
I’ve spoken to hundreds of our people  
in the past year and there has been 
great enthusiasm from across our  
global operations. This is a Group with  
a strong culture, great optimism and  
a clear view of the role we all have to 
play in building a stronger legacy for 
future generations. 
Another highlight is the decisiveness 
we showed in responding to the rapid 
improvement in our core markets. We 
were aggressive during the downturn 
and we were determined to be equally 
proactive in the upturn. I think we’ve 
done that well, particularly in Oil & Gas, 
where the recovery was steepest. We 
did that while at the same time making 
good strategic progress that will deliver 
value over the long term.
In terms of improvements, I think we 
still have work to do to optimise our 
operations. 2017 was about identifying 
opportunities and the years ahead will 
be about seizing those opportunities to 
become more efficient and better serve 
our customers.
Q 
How has the Group’s strategy 
developed in the past year?
We’ve made good progress in defining 
our technology strategy during the year. 
The appointment of our new Chief 
Technology Officer, Geetha Dabir,  
whose career has been spent in Silicon 
Valley, has brought a new perspective 
and focus to the business, as we 
increasingly digitise our offering. We’re 
also developing a new people strategy 
led by our new Chief People Officer, 
Rosemary McGinness, to ensure we 
promote a high-performance culture  
and have the capabilities we will need  
to succeed in the years ahead. We’ll  
do more work to refine that strategy 
throughout 2018. We are also further 
integrating sustainability throughout the 
business and we’ll establish baselines  
in the next year in terms of our own 
performance, in addition to helping our 
customers operate more sustainably.
Q 
The Group operates in cyclical 
markets, how sustainable are 
current conditions?
Industry expectations are also for a 
multi-year upturn in the mining capital 
cycle supported by anticipated demand 
for commodities like copper as the world 
invests more in infrastructure and the 
move towards electric vehicles. 
In oil and gas we’ve clearly seen a 
structural change with shale oil and  
gas becoming very competitive and 
maturing into a dependable source of 
global energy supply. North America and 
the Middle East are the most attractive  
oil and gas markets in the world and  
they also happen to be where most of  
our activity in this industry takes place.  
So I think we are in the right places, with 
good market positions.
Finally, conditions in mid and downstream oil 
and gas and power – both served by Flow 
Control – are showing some green shoots 
of recovery after a prolonged downturn. 
Overall, our markets are increasingly 
attractive and we are well positioned  
to take advantage of those improved 
conditions.
Q 
What are the other main trends 
you see impacting the Group  
in the future?
As a truly global business that serves 
natural resources and energy customers, 
there are many issues we look at. Firstly, 
the health of the global economy, which 
improved in 2017 as growth picked up  
in advanced and emerging economies, 
driving demand for commodities. 
Secondly, tackling climate change is 
clearly a priority and we are investigating 
how we can help customers reduce 
their energy and water usage as well  
as reducing our own environmental 
impact. And thirdly, technology is 
changing rapidly, with ‘big data’ and 
advanced manufacturing increasingly 
important in the markets we serve. 
This is a Group with  
a strong culture, great  
optimism and a clear  
view of the role we all  
have to play in building  
a stronger legacy for  
future generations.
That is why we have a new technology 
strategy to take advantage of these 
changes. There are many more issues  
I could highlight, but uniting them all  
is the importance of being proactive  
and agile as a business so that we can 
respond to changes quickly and capture 
opportunities wherever they are.
Q 
And how does this impact your 
view on allocating capital?
We have some really strong market 
positions and we are focused on using 
those as a platform to grow in what are 
increasingly attractive markets. 
Take comminution (crushing, grinding 
and screening), where we increased 
capability with the acquisition of  
Trio Engineered Products in 2014.  
This allowed us to offer our mining 
customers a wider portfolio of  
products while also giving us access  
to sand and aggregates markets. 
Since the acquisition, the Minerals 
division has applied its materials  
science knowledge to develop new 
crusher technologies and leveraged  
its comprehensive service network to 
globalise the Trio brand in both mining 
and sand, and aggregates, markets. To 
give a sense of the progress, in 2017, 
comminution revenues for original 
equipment increased by a third. 
So where there are opportunities  
to accelerate our strategy through 
disciplined mergers and acquisition 
activity, we’ll take them.
