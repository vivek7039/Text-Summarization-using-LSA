 MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 58 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
Across all platforms staff are expected to maintain 
the confidentiality of all medical, financial and 
administrative patient information of which they may 
become aware during the course of their duties, and 
are required to sign a confidentiality agreement upon 
joining. Access to patient medical records is strictly 
controlled, and medical records are not released 
outside the relevant platform unless authorised by  
the patient.
For more information on the Company’s approach 
and clinical performance, please refer to the 
Clinical Services Overview from page 37 and  
the Clinical Services Report available on the 
Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com.
PATIENT SATISFACTION AND 
EXPERIENCE
In line with its Patients First ethos and to ensure 
operational excellence across all platforms, Mediclinic 
monitors its patients’ experience across the Group. 
In 2014, the Group created a single, standardised 
Patient Experience Index (“PEI”) with the objective of 
achieving incremental and sustainable improvement 
of the patient experience over time. The entire survey 
process is managed by Press Ganey, an internationally 
recognised leader in patient experience research, 
providing an in-depth analysis of the data and advising 
on global best practices.
The PEI was implemented for inpatients at all 
Mediclinic Southern Africa hospitals and for both  
in- and outpatients at all Mediclinic Middle East 
facilities, where it will be introduced during 2017. The 
survey was implemented at Hirslanden from April 2017.
Refer to the table on page 57 for the patient 
satisfaction level of Hirslanden based on the 
ANQ (Swiss National Association for Quality 
Development); and the PEI of Mediclinic Southern 
Africa and Mediclinic Middle East.
PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN HIGH-
QUALITY HOSPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
(FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT)
To ensure a safe and user-friendly environment for 
both our patients and employees, we strive to provide 
high-quality healthcare facilities and technology, 
focusing on capital investments, maintenance of 
facilities and optimal use of facilities. As a result, the 
Group continuously invests in capital projects and new 
equipment to expand and refurbish our facilities and 
the replacement of existing equipment, as well as on 
the repair and maintenance of existing property and 
equipment. Refer to Material Issue 3: Create and 
Sustain Shareholder Value on pages 62 to 63 for 
further detail regarding the Group’s investments in 
capital projects and new equipment; replacement of 
equipment; and repairs and maintenance.
PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN 
MANAGEMENT
In order to deliver its services, Mediclinic is dependent 
on a large and diverse range of suppliers, who form 
an integral part of the Group’s ability to provide 
AR
CSR
AR
quality hospital care. Mediclinic believes in building 
long-term relationships with suitable suppliers and 
establishing a relationship of mutual trust and respect.  
Regular meetings are held with suppliers to ensure 
continuity of service. The Group relies on its suppliers 
to deliver products and services of the highest quality 
in line with Mediclinic’s standards. Various other criteria 
play an important role in selecting suppliers, such as: 
compliance with applicable international and local 
quality standards, price, compliance with appropriate 
specifications suited for the Group’s markets, stability 
of the organisation and the relevant equipment brand, 
good-quality and cost-effective solutions, support 
network, technical advice and training philosophy.  
In South Africa, the BBBEE status of a supplier is also 
a factor in the selection process. An enterprise and 
supplier development strategy specific to procurement 
is being developed in South Africa to enhance  
BBBEE reporting.
The availability of products and services is imperative 
in enabling the Group to deliver quality care to its 
patients, and therefore an important criterion in its 
supplier selection process. Though not always the 
case, this often leads to local suppliers being preferred, 
which adds to better and faster service delivery and 
knowledge of local laws and regulations, particularly 
with regard to pharmaceutical products.
COST OF HEALTHCARE
The Group contributes in various ways to a sustainable 
healthcare system by, inter alia, focussing on efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness, conducting tariff negotiations 
in a fair and transparent manner, expanding facilities 
based on need, and actively participating in healthcare 
reform.
The Group is focused on streamlining and centralising 
its procurement processes to improve efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness. During the reporting period, 
good progress was made on a range of international 
procurement initiatives including:
• 
the classification and matching of products used 
across all its operating platforms to compare prices 
and drive procurement strategies; 
• 
better prices through pooling of capital equipment 
purchases across the three platforms; 
• 
volume bonus agreements with key capital 
equipment suppliers; and
• 
direct importing and distribution of more  
cost-effective surgical and consumable products.
Refer to the Chief Executive Officer’s Review, Our 
Strategy, Progress and Aims, as well as the Divisional 
Reviews included in this report, for various examples of 
initiatives to improve cost-effectiveness.
ACCREDITATION
Hospitals are high-risk environments in which complex 
treatment processes are executed using sophisticated 
equipment and techniques. The process of external 
accreditation ensures that international standards 
are adhered to in all aspects of hospital operations. 
For more details on accreditation, please refer to the

MATERIAL ISSUE 2: ADDRESS SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE 
PRACTITIONERS
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE 
BUSINESS
The attraction of suitably qualified healthcare 
professionals is essential in delivering the Group’s 
Patients First strategy. For this reason, priority focus 
is given to a proactive sourcing approach aligned to 
workforce planning for the medium term. Nurses, 
pharmacists and doctors are categorised as critical 
skills and an integrated talent management strategy 
is tailored to each of these categories to ensure the 
support of the entire employee life cycle in these 
roles. A definite strength is the available talent 
analytics which indicate patterns in candidate and 
employee behaviour over time. These provide a strong  
predictive advantage and these insights are 
incorporated into the talent management strategy for 
each of these categories.
The focus of attracting and utilising talent in a 
challenging healthcare market continues to be nurses, 
emergency room doctors and pharmacists. Proactive 
initiatives are implemented in the specific categories 
and geographical areas of concern.

SUMMARISED APPROACH AND 
PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR
EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND 
RETENTION
The human resources policies and supporting good 
practice protocols at each platform provide governance 
guidelines to ensure consistent practices in support 
of the entire employee life cycle. Good progress was 
made during the period under review in terms of the 
internationalisation of the human resources strategy. 
The focus remains to address local challenges through 
tailored human resources strategies at platform level, 
but to also share global expertise and best practices to 
the benefit of all. 
International and local processes have been defined 
and priority is given to longer-term system enablement 
through the implementation of an integrated human 
resources management system. The value of comparable 
and quality data, which is made accessible to all 
stakeholders will become evident in the medium to longer 
term. Talent analytics have always been an important 
focus and the value of comparable quality Group data 
will provide a competitive edge in terms of trend and risk 
identification and the input to proactive strategy.
LABOUR RELATIONS AND 
REMUNERATION
Employee remuneration
The Group remunerates employees in a manner that 
supports the achievement of the Group’s vision and 
strategic objectives, while attracting and retaining 
scarce skills and rewarding high levels of performance. 
This is achieved through establishing remuneration 
practices that are fair, reasonable and market-related 
while at the same time maintaining an appropriate 
balance between employee and shareholder interest. 
To encourage a performance-driven organisation, 
the Group rewards employees for achieving strategic 
objectives as well as individual personal performance 
targets. Benefits for all employees include a retirement 
fund, medical aid scheme, performance-related 
incentives and bonuses and liability insurance for 
medical staff. Those managers who receive variable 
remuneration have a combination of short- and  
long-term incentives. During 2015, the Group 
introduced a Reward Centre of Expertise, specialising 
in the design and delivery of global reward initiatives. 
Labour relations
The Group believes in building sound long-term relations 
with its employees and employee representatives, 
which supports its goal of being the employer of choice 
in the healthcare industry. This is measured by the Your 
Voice employee engagement survey and continuous 
assessment of the Group’s employment conditions. 
The Group respects and complies with the labour 
legislation in the countries in which it operates, and 
ensures that the internal policies and procedures 
are evaluated regularly to accommodate continual 
amendments to relevant legislation. The Group 
continuously strives to ensure that all its employees 
are informed of their benefits, and this information 
is communicated to staff via the intranet, staff 
newsletters, staff consultation meetings and various 
other forms of communication media. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 61 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
TRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
The Group continues to invest significantly in training 
and skills development to maintain and improve quality 
service delivery. The percentage of payroll invested in 
training and skills development by each of the Group’s 
operating platforms is provided on page 59.
The Group’s commitment to provide quality care 
for its patients can only be ensured if its staff has 
appropriate, evolving skill sets, which is reflected in the 
number of learning initiatives undertaken each year.  
A consistent performance management system is 
applied throughout the Group, which allows us to 
identify and manage training needs of individual 
employees, and to discuss career development. 
Succession planning is standardised on an 
organisational level in all three operating platforms 
and a Group talent review is performed annually. 
Critical talent (such as nurses and pharmacists) 
as well as high-performing individuals with 
potential are identified and supported through 
tailored development initiatives. An inter-platform 
development programme which offers a series of 
secondments across platforms has been designed 
to help these individuals excel at Mediclinic. The 
programme is currently implemented at organisational 
level for talent with the potential to be successors 
to a key position in their own platform or across 
platforms within the larger Mediclinic Group. The aim 
of the programme is to provide priority talent (either 
critical talent or high performers with potential), the 
opportunity to gain cross-platform exposure. All 
platforms have received the programme with great 
enthusiasm and the Group is proud to continue to 
grow this amazing development opportunity to the 
benefit of all.
SUPPORT OF EXTERNAL TRAINING 
INSTITUTIONS
The Group is committed to educational development in 
all three of its operating platforms and provides financial 
and other support towards healthcare education.
EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY
Health and safety policies and procedures are in place 
across the Group to ensure a safe working environment 
for the Group’s employees, patients and its visitors. 
The health and safety of the Group’s employees are 
essential and contribute to the sustainability of quality 
care to patients. The programmes and procedures 
implemented by the various business units to mitigate 
health and safety risks are outlined in the Sustainable 
Development Report.
AR
SDR
During the year, there were no incidents of material 
non-compliance with any laws, regulations, accepted 
standards or codes applicable to the Group, with no 
significant fines being imposed, concerning the health 
and safety impact of the Group’s services.
EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION AND 
ENGAGEMENT
In 2015, Mediclinic, in partnership with Gallup, 
introduced the Your Voice employee engagement 
programme across all operating platforms to measure 
levels of engagement, identify gaps at a departmental 
level and support line managers in developing action 
plans to address concerns. 
Overall, the Group achieved a 71% (2016: 65%) participation 
rate in the Your Voice survey and 36% (2016: 32%) of 
employees showed high levels of engagement.
Strengths which the survey highlighted include 
employees knowing what is expected of them and 
having the appropriate materials and equipment to 
perform at work. Areas for improvement highlighted 
by the survey include recognition and praise for good 
work and valuing the opinions of employees.
During 2017, Mediclinic aims to follow a more focused 
approach by driving central engagement themes and 
ensuring adequate feedback and action planning takes 
place at all localities and departments. Champions have 
been trained to support line managers in facilitating 
workshops to address concerns at the departmental 
level. Champions and line managers will work towards 
developing a better understanding of the engagement 
needs of the Mediclinic workforce and addressing 
concerns according to the engagement hierarchy.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 62 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
MATERIAL ISSUE 3: CREATE AND SUSTAIN SHAREHOLDER VALUE
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE 
BUSINESS
As can be seen from its business model on pages 22 
to 23, the Group is only able to offer the best possible 
care to its patients with support and investment from 
its shareholders. The Group believes that identifying 
and realising suitable growth opportunities is key to 
create and sustain shareholder value over the longer 
term, as these opportunities enable it to realise tangible 
benefits. Such benefits include: reduced costs through 
procurement on a greater scale; the creation of 
shared operations teams; the combination of existing 
corporate functions; and the transfer of knowledge 
and best practices across the Group.

MATERIAL ISSUE 4: RESPONSIBLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE 
BUSINESS
The Group’s main environmental impacts are the 
utilisation of resources, predominantly energy, through 
electricity consumption and water, and the disposal of 
healthcare risk waste. The Group is fully aware of the 
need to use resources responsibly and is committed 
to minimising its environmental impacts to the extent 
possible. 
The Group recognises the risks that regulatory changes, 
environmental constraints and climate change present 
to its operations. Potential impacts include rising 
costs, reduced access to facilities, interruptions in 
service, and incidents of extreme weather events as a 
result of climate change placing additional stress on 
operations. Additionally, climate change can lead to 
water shortages (especially in the UAE and in Southern 
Africa) and weather-induced pandemics and disease 
outbreaks which can cause high mortality rates. 
However, the Group also believes that using resources 
responsibly can be a source of strategic advantage 
for the Group, allowing it to manage and contain its 
operating costs and to ensure ongoing access to water 
and energy supplies.
Mediclinic’s patients are always its first priority, but 
without natural resources, especially water, Mediclinic 
would not be able to provide a service to its patients. 
The Group takes its policies to reduce its impact 
on the environment very seriously and its Natural 
Resources Committee is constantly investigating new 
opportunities to reduce its impact on the environment.

The Group’s main environmental impacts are the 
utilisation of resources and waste which have a direct 
effect on carbon emissions. Items listed in the aspect 
register relating to regulatory compliance, healthcare 
risk waste, water, electricity, paper, hazardous waste 
and gases not only could have a significant impact on 
the environment, but also informs strategy on climate 
change related risks and opportunities.
The carbon emissions per platform, for the periods 
as specified therein, are reported in the Sustainable 
Development Report.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Electricity is the main contributor to our carbon 
footprint and all our platforms are taking steps to 
reduce their electricity consumption intensity through 
the adoption of ISO 14001 management standards, 
leading to improved operational efficiency of technical 
installations, introduction of various new energy-
efficient and renewable technologies and changes in 
staff behaviour regarding energy use. 
The direct and indirect energy consumption per 
platform, for the periods as specified therein, is 
reported in the Sustainable Development Report.
WATER USAGE
The Group’s platforms in Southern Africa and in the 
UAE can suffer from significant water shortages so it 
is critical for the Group to monitor water consumption 
closely. There are various measures in place to minimise 
water consumption; including reclaiming water, 
monitoring hot water consumption and installing water 
meters and control sensors. 
The total water usage has decreased throughout the 
Group. The total volume of water withdrawn from 
water utilities throughout the Group, for the periods 
as specified therein, is reported in the Sustainable 
Development Report.
WASTE MANAGEMENT
Stringent protocols are followed to ensure that refuse 
removal within the Group complies with all legislation, 
regulations and by-laws. The Group regards the 
handling of waste in an environmentally sound, legal 
and safe manner as its ethical, moral and professional 
duty. During the reporting period, there were no 
incidents at the Group’s facilities or offices leading to 
significant spills.

CARBON EMISSIONS
The CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure 
Project) is a global initiative measuring companies 
around the world and their reporting on greenhouse gas 
emissions and climate change strategies. It is regarded 
as a global leader in capturing and analysing data 
that record the business response to climate change, 
including management of risks and opportunities, 
absolute emissions levels, performance over time and 
governance. Participation and disclosure of the results 
are voluntary. The project was launched in South Africa 
in 2007 in partnership with the National Business 
Initiative in which JSE-listed companies are measured. 
Mediclinic has participated in the project since 2008, 
initially only in respect of Mediclinic Southern Africa. 
Limited information in respect of Mediclinic Middle 
East has also been included since 2010, although it 
still remains an initiative focusing mainly on Mediclinic 
Southern Africa’s data. Mediclinic’s CDP reports can be 
accessed on the CDP website at www.cdp.net, with the 
most recent reports also available on the Company’s 
website at www.mediclinic.com.

clear guidelines and frameworks to assist in achieving 
set objectives, for example, compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations.
SUMMARISED APPROACH AND 
PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR
ETHICS AND GOVERNANCE
The Group’s commitment to ethical standards is set out 
in the Group’s values, and is supported by the Group 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”), 
available on the Company’s website. The Code provides 
a framework for the standards of business conduct 
and ethics that are required of all business divisions, 
directors and employees. The Code is available to all 
staff and is included in new employee inductions.
Further details regarding the Group’s ethics 
management, risk management process and corporate 
governance practices are discussed in detail in 
the report on Risk Management, Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties and the Corporate Governance 
Statement.
EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s Enterprise-wide Risk Management 
(“ERM”) policy follows the international Committee 
of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”) framework and defines the risk 
management objectives, methodology, risk appetite, 
risk identification, assessment and treatment processes 
and the responsibilities of the various risk management 
role-players in the Group. The ERM policy is subject to 
annual review and any amendments are submitted  
to the Audit and Risk Committee for approval. 
The objective of risk management in the Group is to 
establish an integrated and effective risk management 
framework where important and emerging risks are 
identified, quantified and managed. An ERM software 
application supports the Group’s risk management 
process in all three operating platforms.
Further details on the Group’s risk management 
approach, as well as principal risks and uncertainties 
are included in the report on Risk Management, 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties.

MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 67 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 68 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS
Compliance risk was identified as an integral risk 
management focus area for the year across the 
Group. In light of the large volume of legislative and 
regulatory requirements applicable to the Group in 
each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, as well as 
various industry standards that the platforms should 
comply with, compliance risk requires specific focus. 
A three-year compliance monitoring programme was 
developed to enhance the existing compliance culture 
and approach to compliance risk in the Group. Good 
progress was made to define and integrate relevant 
laws and potential risks in the risk registers of the 
various platforms and departments during the year.
Further details on the Group’s compliance management 
are included in the report on Risk Management, 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties, and in the Audit 
and Risk Committee Report.
HUMAN RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF 
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
During the year, no material incidents of discrimination, 
violations involving rights of indigenous people  
and/or human rights reviews or impact assessments 
were observed or reported throughout the Group.
BROAD-BASED BLACK ECONOMIC 
EMPOWERMENT (“BBBEE”) (SOUTH 
AFRICA ONLY)
Mediclinic Southern Africa forms an integral part of 
the political, social and economic community in South 
Africa and is committed to sustainable transformation 
as part of its business strategy. Mediclinic Southern 
Africa’s Executive Committee is responsible to ensure 
that the appropriate focus is placed on the group’s 
commitment to the development and implementation 
of sustainable BBBEE initiatives. 
Mediclinic Southern Africa is assessed annually by 
an accredited verification agency against the generic 
scorecard criteria set by the Department of Trade 
and Industry (“dti”). During the period under review, 
Mediclinic Southern Africa was assessed in terms of 
the new BBBEE Codes of Good Practice, gazetted in 
2013, for the first time. As anticipated, this resulted 
in Mediclinic Southern Africa’s total BBBEE score, as 
measured with regards to ownership, management 
and control, skills development, enterprise and supplier 
development and socio-economic development, 
declining from 73.06 to 51.73 during the year, which 
score is currently being reviewed. Mediclinic Southern 
Africa is further reviewing its BBBEE strategy with  
a view to increase its BBBEE score in future.
AR
The number of black employees increased  
year-on-year from 70.5% to 71.22% of total employees.  
Black management representation increased from 11% 
in 2006 to 27.7% (2016: 25.7%) at year end.
During the year, Mediclinic Southern Africa’s 
transformation department continued with the diversity 
management interventions through workshops and 
presentations for employees throughout the group. 
The workshops are designed to help employees have 
a better understanding of diversity to embrace and 
celebrate diversity and be able to recruit, manage and 
retain talented employees from diverse backgrounds.
Mediclinic Southern Africa’s current employment 
equity plan expires in October 2017. The company is 
currently in the process of compiling a new plan which 
will expire in 2022. A summarised employment equity 
report (EEA2), as submitted to the Department of 
Labour in November 2016, is included in the Sustainable 
Development Report.
CORPORATE SOCIAL INVESTMENT (“CSI”)
The Group contributes to the well-being of the 
communities within which it operates by investing 
in ongoing initiatives that address socio-economic 
problems or risks, and it has established Mediclinic as 
an integral member of these communities, enriching 
the lives of many communities throughout Southern 
Africa, Switzerland and the UAE.
The Group’s CSI activities are structured around the 
improvement of healthcare through training and 
education, sponsorships, donations, staff volunteerism, 
public private initiatives and joint ventures. Many of the 
Group’s initiatives relate to providing training and to 
financial support of training. Due to the socio-economic 
conditions in Southern Africa, the majority of our CSI 
contributions are by Mediclinic Southern Africa.
The CSI spend per platform is provided on page 66.

AR MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 69 CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
Dear Shareholder,
The Board and I are committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity and 
ethics, which is embedded in our corporate culture and values. Our corporate governance structures support the 
effective delivery of Mediclinic’s strategy and are focused on maintaining and building a sustainable business and 
supporting our commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen in every country and community in which the 
Group does business. The key elements of our governance structures include:
• 
ensuring good clinical outcomes and quality healthcare (refer to the Clinical Services Overview from  
page 37, as well as the Clinical Services Report available on the Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com);
• 
upholding strict principles of corporate governance, integrity and ethics (refer to the Corporate 
Governance Statement from page 73); 
• 
maintaining effective risk management and internal controls (refer to the report on Risk Management, 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties from page 30);
• 
engaging with our stakeholders and responding to their reasonable expectations (refer to the stakeholder 
engagement section in the Sustainable Development Report available on the Company’s website at  
www.mediclinic.com); 
• 
managing our business in a sustainable manner (refer to the Sustainable Development Highlights from 
page 54, as well as the Sustainable Development Report available on the Company’s website at  
www.mediclinic.com); and
• 
offering our employees competitive remuneration packages based on the principles of fairness and 
affordability (refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 85, as well as the Sustainable 
Development Report available on the Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com).
In the Corporate Governance Statement that follows, feedback is given on the governance framework, Board 
meetings and the principal activities of the Board, the composition and diversity of the Board and measures 
to ensure the Board’s accountability to our stakeholders. Every Director demonstrated their commitment to 
Mediclinic throughout the year, through their meeting attendance and the high quality of their contributions 
at those meetings. I am pleased that the Board structure put in place following the Al Noor Combination in  
February 2016 has operated effectively. The internal self-evaluation of the Board conducted during the year did 
not raise any major areas requiring improvement. With the retirement of Craig Tingle, Chief Financial Officer, and 
Ian Tyler, Senior Independent Director, during the year, the Nomination Committee and the Board continued to 
focus on succession planning and targeting diverse pools of talent from which to recruit the right individuals. 
I remain confident that the Board, supported by an effective management team and an effective governance 
structure, is well placed to continue creating long-term value for stakeholders and maintaining Mediclinic’s 
leading position in the international healthcare market.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Board of Directors is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for ensuring the sound management 
and long-term success of the Group. This can only 
be achieved if the Board is supported by appropriate 
governance processes to ensure that the Group is 
managed responsibly and with integrity, fairness, 
transparency and accountability. This Corporate 
Governance Statement describes the key elements of 
Mediclinic’s corporate governance framework. 
A Group Corporate Governance Manual, dealing with 
Board practices and Group policies, provides guidance 
to the company secretaries, boards and management 
of the Company and its three operating platforms 
in Southern Africa, Switzerland and the United Arab 
Emirates to ensure that similar corporate governance 
practices are followed throughout the Group.
COMPLIANCE WITH UK 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
AND LISTING RULES
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance and the highest 
standards of integrity and ethics. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “UK Corporate Governance 
Code” or the “Code”), most recently updated 
in April 2016 by the Financial Reporting Council 
(the “FRC”) and available on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk, contains a series of broad principles 
and specific provisions which embody good practice 
in relation to five key areas: leadership, effectiveness, 
accountability, remuneration and relations with 
shareholders. This report, together with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the various Board 
committee reports included in this Annual Report, 
describes how the Board applied the main principles 
of the Code and complied with its provisions. 
During the year under review and up to the date of this 
report, the Company complied with all the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, other than the 
exceptions noted below:
• 
Provision B.2.1 (regarding the Nomination 
Committee leading the process for Board 
appointments and making recommendations  
to the Board)
Appointments to the Board are recommended by 
the Nomination Committee and further details on 
the Committee and the appointment process can 
be found on pages 108 to 110. In accordance with 
the Company’s relationship agreement with its 
principal shareholder, Remgro Limited (“Remgro”), 
further details of which are provided on page 125, 
Remgro is entitled to appoint up to a maximum 
of three Directors to the Board. Jannie Durand 
represents Remgro on the Board of Directors and 
was appointed by Remgro in the previous reporting 
period on 15 February 2016. His appointment was 
therefore not led by the Nomination Committee.

With the exception of this appointment, made 
in accordance with the terms of the relationship 
agreement, the Nomination Committee leads 
the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board in accordance with 
the Code. No new Board appointments were made 
in terms of the Relationship Agreement during the 
year under review.
• 
Provision D.2.1 (regarding having at least three 
independent non-executive directors serving on the 
Remuneration Committee)
Ian Tyler, who served as an independent non-
executive member of the Remuneration Committee, 
resigned as a Director on 21 February 2017. From 
the date of his resignation up to the appointment of 
Seamus Keating as an independent non-executive 
member of the Remuneration Committee on  
17 March 2017, the Remuneration Committee had 
only two independent non-executive members 
and did not meet the requirement to have at least  
three independent non-executive members. The 
Company fully complied with this requirement apart 
from this short period between 21 February 2017 and 
17 March 2017, during which period no committee 
meetings were held.
• 
Provision E.1.1 (regarding the attendance by the 
Senior Independent Director (“SID”) of sufficient 
meetings with a range of major shareholders)
The Company has not met the requirement that the 
“SID should attend sufficient meetings with a range 
of major shareholders to listen to their views in 
order to help develop a balanced understanding of 
the issues and concerns of major shareholders”. This 
provision of the Code, supports the main principle 
of the Code requiring dialogue with shareholders 
based on a mutual understanding of objectives and 
that the Chairman should ensure that all Directors 
are made aware of their major shareholders’ issues 
and concerns, with which the Company complies. 
The Board believes that appropriate mechanisms 
are in place to engage with shareholders, without 
the need for the SID to attend meetings with major 
shareholders. The SID is, however, available to 
attend such meetings if requested by shareholders. 
Although the SID and any other Non-executive 
Directors have the opportunity to attend analyst 
presentations hosted by the Company, the principal 
engagement with the capital markets lies mainly 
with CEO, CFO and the Head of Investor Relations, 
who provide regular feedback to the Board on 
investor relations matters, including, inter alia, an 
overview of meetings held with investors. Refer 
to pages 83 to 84 for more information on the 
Company’s shareholder engagement. 
In addition to complying with applicable corporate 
governance requirements in the UK in accordance with 
its primary listing on the LSE, the Board is also satisfied 
that the Company meets all relevant requirements of 
the JSE Listings Requirements and the NSX Listings 
Requirements as a result of its secondary listings on 
the JSE, the South African securities exchange, and the 
NSX, the Namibian securities exchange.
