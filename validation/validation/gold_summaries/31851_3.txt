 Our results
Our reported results show good progress 
against the prior period, with sales growth 
of +9.2 per cent and even stronger growth in 
adjusted EBITDA *** at +16.0 per cent against 
the restated figure for the prior period. We 
consider adjusted EBITDA *** to be the key 
measure that best represents the business’ 
underlying performance as it excludes 
exceptional items and bar opening costs 
that are a function of the timing of the new 
venue development programme rather 
than the underlying trade. Last year’s 
adjusted EBITDA*** has been restated from 
£15.6 million to £13.0 million. Operating 
profit was £3.7 million (2016 Restated*: 
£5.3 million) but this was after charging 
exceptional items of £4.3 million (2016 
Restated*: £1.4 million).
During the year, there was significant change 
within our finance team. This included the 
Chief Financial Officer, Sean Curran, and the 
Group Financial Controller, who had both 
been with the business for over ten years, 
both leaving the Group. Chris Chambers 
replaced Sean in the autumn of 2016 but 
resigned shortly thereafter in February 2017 . 
Mike Foster joined the business in March 
2017 , initially as interim Finance Director, 
before being appointed to the Board and 
as the Group’s Chief Financial Officer in 
early June 2017 . 
The new team’s initial focus was to assess 
the forecast results for the current period. 
This review resulted in the trading update 
that was released on 19 May 2017. The 
current finance team has strengthened 
and upgraded the systems and processes 
of the finance function. Additionally, a 
detailed review has been undertaken of 
the application of the Group’s accounting 
policies and practices. This review has 
resulted in a restatement of the prior 
period’s results.
Summary
STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The clear and focused strategy, the quality of our sites and proposition, and the talent 
within the Group leave the business well placed for further growth in 2018. 
The scale and strength of our new venue pipeline and the excellent returns achieved 
by new venues opened in the last two years mean that the business can be confident 
about achieving its growth targets going forward.
>  The Board paid an interim dividend 
this year of 1.65 pence per share 
(2016: 1.5 pence per share).
>  Subject to approval at the 
Company’s annual general 
meeting, we will pay a final 
dividend of 3.3 pence per share 
(2016: 3.3 pence per share).
As the Chairman of Revolution Bars 
Group plc, it is my privilege to introduce 
this, our third annual report and accounts 
for the 52 weeks ended 1 July 2017. 
Our business
The strategy of the Group is to provide 
high-quality retail brands in the leisure sector. 
Our business comprises two strong brands: 
Revolution, which is focused on young adults, 
and Revolución de Cuba, which is focused on 
a broader age range. Whilst both businesses 
are wet-led, food is an important part of our 
growth and of our appeal to both customer 
groups. Our strategy for growing the business 
is to be customer focused, continually striving 
to provide a better experience both in terms 
of product offering, ambience and facilities 
leading to repeat visits and driving like-for-like 
sales. The Group is additionally focused on 
growing its footprint and number of premium 
bars by seeking new sites in good locations, 
and investing capital to deliver good returns. 
This year we opened six new venues, four of 
which were Revolución de Cubas. Two years 
ago, Revolución de Cuba traded from only 
five venues but, including Belfast, which 
opened shortly after the period end, the 
brand now trades from 14 venues and has 
the potential for further significant growth 
in the number of trading units.
At the beginning of the period, the Group 
operated from 62 venues (53 Revolutions 
and nine Revolución de Cubas). During the 
reporting period there were six openings and 
we temporarily closed one venue in May but 
reopened it in September 2017 , and therefore 
the Group traded from 67 venues at the end 
of the reporting period.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
04 Recommended cash offer for 
the Group 
Following the Group’s trading update in 
May 2017 updating investors on lower than 
anticipated profitability for the full year ended 
1 July 2017, and the resulting drop in the 
Group’s share price, Stonegate Pub Company 
Limited (“Stonegate”) made an approach to 
acquire the Group. On 24 August 2017 , the 
Board recommended Stonegate’s cash offer 
of 203 pence per share, which represented 
a 62.4 per cent premium to the share price 
prior to the commencement of the offer 
period on 31 July 2017. It is expected that 
the Group’s shareholders will vote on the 
recommended cash offer from Stonegate 
on 17 October 2017 .
The Board is also engaged with Deltic 
Group plc (“Deltic”) as a possible offeror 
for the Group. Deltic has outlined a merger 
proposal, which the Board has rejected due 
to significant concerns regarding both value 
and deliverability. Deltic has indicated that, 
in order to put forward its merger proposal 
and discuss it with the Group’s shareholders, 
it will in due course publish its own profit 
forecast and a quantified financial benefits 
statement in respect of a merger. In parallel, 
Deltic has also stated that it continues 
to evaluate a possible cash offer for the 
Group. The Takeover Panel announced on 
21 September 2017 that Deltic must either 
announce a firm intention to make an offer 
for the Group under Rule 2.7 of the City Code 
on Takeovers and Mergers, or announce 
that it does not intend to make an offer, 
by 5.00 p.m. on 10 October 2017. Deltic 
is continuing to perform due diligence on 
the Group, and the Board is committed to 
ensuring that the interests of shareholders 
are best served.
Our Board
As previously noted, Chris Chambers 
resigned from the Board in February 2017 . 
Mike Foster was appointed as Chief Financial 
Officer (and to the Board) in early June 2017 . 
We also welcomed Jemima Bird as a 
Non-executive Director in December 2016.
Our dividend
T o date, the Board has adopted a progressive 
dividend policy reflecting the cash flow 
*  Restated – see Note 1(b) of the consolidated financial statements for an explanation and analysis of the prior year adjustments included in respect of the profit for the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016.
** Like-for-like sales are defined as total retail sales from bars that have been trading continuously for at least 12 months.
*** Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the Financial Review).
generation and long-term earnings potential 
of the Group whilst retaining sufficient capital 
to fund investment to grow the business. 
However, in light of the restatement of profits 
relating to earlier periods and the lower level 
of underlying earnings for the current period 
relative to original expectations, the Board is 
proposing a final dividend of 3.3 pence per 
share (2016: 3.3 pence). This will result in the 
dividend for the full year being at 4.95 pence 
per share, an interim dividend of 1.65 pence 
per share (2016: 1.5 pence) having been 
paid on 6 April 2017 .
The final dividend is subject to approval at 
the Company’s annual general meeting and 
would ordinarily be expected to be paid on 
7 December 2017 . However, if the Stonegate 
acquisition of the Group completes prior to 
the annual general meeting taking place, the 
dividend will not be payable. 
Stonegate will have the right to reduce 
the amount of consideration payable for 
each Revolution share by the amount of 
any dividend (or other distribution) which 
is paid or becomes payable by Revolution 
to Revolution shareholders before the date on 
which the proposed scheme of arrangement 
becomes effective, which is expected to 
be on or about 23 October 2017. Based 
on the expected timetable, therefore, it is 
not anticipated that any dividend (or other 
distribution) will be paid or that the offer 
price will be reduced. 
If Stonegate does exercise its right to reduce 
the amount of consideration payable for 
each Revolution share by the amount of any 
dividend (or other distribution) that has not 
been paid, Revolution shareholders will be 
entitled to receive and retain that dividend 
(or other distribution). 
Our people
The Group has a skilled workforce as 
well as experienced senior and regional 
management teams with proven credentials 
in the industry. Strong cohesive teams have 
been built across our businesses with a 
focus on staff training and development to 
continuously improve individual capabilities 
and trading performance. I would like 
to recognise the commitment and the 
substantial effort of all our employees 
and thank them for their contribution to the 
Group’s performance. It is their continued 
dedication and commitment to the business 
together with a clear strategic plan that is 
integral to our achievements.
Our future
Given the recommended cash offer for 
the business from Stonegate, it is likely that 
the ownership of the Company will change 
in the next few weeks. However, such an 
event is not certain and, whatever the 
outcome of the potential transactions, 
the business is well placed to succeed.
We have two strong brands that are trading 
well in a challenging market. In the first 
quarter of the new period, like-for-like** 
sales are +0.3 per cent and our first new 
opening this year in Belfast has achieved 
the best initial sales levels of all 12 openings 
in the last two years, averaging £80k per full 
week since opening. 
The sector is facing some well-publicised 
and significant cost headwinds: minimum 
wage and living wage rate increases, the 
introduction of the apprenticeship levy 
and substantial increases in general rates 
following the 2017 revaluation. Staffing 
and recruitment may now also come under 
pressure due to Brexit-related issues. 
However, now that we have dealt with 
the historical financial reporting issues, 
and have improved reporting and controls 
in place, we are better placed to be able 
to rise to these challenges.
The scale and strength of our new venue 
pipeline and the excellent returns achieved 
by new venues opened in the last two years 
mean that the business can be confident 
about achieving its growth targets going 
forward. The clear and focused strategy, the 
quality of our sites and proposition, and the 
talent within the Group leave the business 
well placed for further growth in 2018.
