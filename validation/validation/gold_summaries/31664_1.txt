A3.1   Strategy review 
The last few years have been a period of transition for the Group from a monoline centralised lender to 
an increasingly diversified banking group. Over the last twelve months, a significant component of this 
transition was completed with the reorganisation of the Group’s operating structure, resulting in the 
bulk of its activities moving under its banking subsidiary, Paragon Bank, following authorisation from the 
Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’) and Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’).
Recognising the focus on a retail deposit led banking strategy, the Group changed its name to 
Paragon Banking Group in September 2017 and has subsequently re-branded its operating units. 
The reorganisation has created a simplified operating model, enhanced governance processes with 
a streamlined and unified board and management structure, and greater transparency. This has 
been reflected in the way the Group now reports its results, as three operating units – Mortgages, 
Commercial Lending and Idem Capital, as well as its centralised operations.
The restructure will deliver significant liquidity benefits, together with a notable reduction in the need for 
the Company to issue debt over the medium term, thereby reducing the Group’s funding costs over time 
and, in turn, giving the Group far greater access to the retail deposit market to support its lending activities.
Notwithstanding the above, the overall Group’s core strategy remains unchanged. The Group is a leading 
UK specialist lender, supporting the needs of consumers and SMEs. It is seeking to develop its presence 
further in these broad markets by increasing product diversification whilst utilising its highly efficient 
centralised operating platform and excellent technology. Organic growth has been strong and this is 
expected to continue into the future and will be supplemented by M&A activity where appropriate. The 
Group has an outstanding through-the-cycle track record in challenging markets with excellent risk 
metrics, reflective of the cautious and prudent approach it takes to its risk appetite alongside the highly 
efficient operating model.
Alongside its transition to a banking model, the Group has made good progress in delivering improved 
profits and strong organic new business generation. Underlying profits (Appendix C) rose by 1.0% 
to £145.2 million during the year (2016: £143.8 million) having absorbed the costs of the Group’s 
£150.0 million Tier 2 Bond, the start-up costs of new lending lines, incurred as part of the diversification 
strategy and the impact of the restructuring. Profits on the statutory basis increased by 1.1% 
to £144.8 million (2016: £143.2 million). Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) increased by 6.4% to 43.1 pence 
(2016: 40.5 pence) (note 29) and return on tangible equity (‘RoTE’) improved to 13.4% (2016: 12.9%) 
(note 7).

Lending
The year has seen continued strong growth levels in organic business generation and further debt purchase activity, albeit the level of portfolio 
acquisitions, at £98.0 million, was at a lower level than the £208.8 million achieved in 2016. Group wide organic originations rose 28.8% to 
£1,853.4 million compared to £1,439.1 million last year. The combination of portfolio purchases and organic growth contributed to net loan 
growth of 3.6% to £11,124.1 million over the last twelve months (2016: £10,737.5 million). 
The growth and diversification of organic business flows over the past five years is shown in the table below, demonstrating the progress made 
in the Group’s core buy-to-let market and the growing influence of the newer, diversified product streams.

The Group’s core business remains its buy-to-let franchise. The UK private rented sector continues to see strong levels of demand from tenants 
which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. The buy-to-let market has experienced a period of disruption following a series of fiscal 
and regulatory changes aimed at both landlords and lenders. These changes disrupted the level of market activity during the year, dampening 
demand in the sector at an aggregate level. Against this backdrop the Group’s performance has been strong, with its twenty-year experience 
of servicing the complex needs of professional landlords differentiating it from other lenders and allowing the business to make market share 
gains during the year. New buy-to-let origination levels increased by 20.6% from the previous year’s level to £1,399.9 million in the year to 
September 2017 (2016: £1,161.0 million), with the Group’s market share, as measured by the figures reported by UK Finance, increasing from 
2.74% to 3.93%. 
The most recent regulatory changes in the buy-to-let market require lenders to collect and analyse more information about the landlord’s 
property portfolio and wider business than has previously been common in the market. The Group considers that this will lead to further 
disruption with some lenders restricting their buy-to-let activity as a result of the increased demands of a complex underwriting process. 
The Group’s expertise in this particular market segment positions the business well to benefit from these changes and further increase its 
market share.  
The Group’s other mortgage businesses comprise its second mortgage activities, where new origination levels rose 35.2% to £60.7 million 
during the year (2016: £44.9 million) and a specialist residential lending operation, which remains in its pilot phase with distribution limited 
to a small fraction of the Group’s broker panel pending final systems and process enhancements. New specialist residential volumes totalled 
£3.9 million during the year (2016: £nil).
Further asset and income diversification is generated by the Group’s Commercial Lending division.  The principal activity of the division is asset 
finance, where strong progress has been made following the acquisitions made in the previous year. The Group’s asset finance activities are 
transforming to service a broader mid-market range of SME customers, as opposed to the more limited niches originally serviced. This strategy 
has resulted in higher new business volumes (up 52.5% on the eleven month performance in 2016 to £220.0 million in 2017). Customer credit 
profiles are generally stronger in this larger sector, with yields commensurately lower. The Group’s motor finance business also saw strong 
growth in 2017. Operating in the hire and lease purchase segments of the market (with no exposure to personal contract purchase products), 
new business origination grew by 50.4% to £120.0 million during the year (2016: £79.8 million). The final established sector is the division’s 
development finance operation, providing funding to smaller property developers, where new drawings totalled £48.9 million in the first full 
operating year of the business (2016: £9.1 million).
The Group has also established a team to provide structured lending solutions to non-bank financial institutions, with the first lending scheduled 
for the second quarter of the Group’s 2018 financial year. 
The Group’s portfolio purchase business, Idem Capital, is an established purchaser of secured and unsecured portfolios. Gross purchases in 
2017 were £98.0 million (2016: £208.8 million). The sector has proved increasingly popular for both specialist purchasers and credit funds in 
recent years, with yields reducing as a consequence. Idem Capital has retained its credit and pricing discipline across the past year, but as a 
consequence investment levels have reduced year-on-year.   PAGE 23  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Funding
The increased banking focus of the Group is evidenced by the pace of development of its retail deposit funding base, together with Paragon 
Bank’s increased access to Bank of England facilities. At 30 September 2017, retail savings balances were £3.6 billion and Term Funding 
Scheme (‘TFS’) drawings totalled £0.7 billion, compared with savings deposits of £1.9 billion and £nil TFS drawings a year earlier. In addition to 
funding new advances, the Group has also refinanced a number of previously securitised or warehoused portfolios using retail deposit funding 
during the year, with similar refinancing activity expected over the coming years.
The Group’s funding has become increasingly diversified in the years following the financial crisis. This is illustrated by the chart below which 
shows, for each of the year ends since the Group re-entered the funding markets, the outstanding balance on post 2010 funding lines. Funding 
for pre-2010 balances is still primarily provided by securitisation funding arranged around the time of advance.
Post 2010 funding by type (£m)
30 September 2011 – 2017
£ million
Warehouse RMBS Retail bond
Tier 2 bond Idem Capital Retail deposits
Retail deposits represent the Group’s primary source of funding for new lending, with its historical securitisation approach taking a more tactical 
role as and when conditions in that market are attractive, maintaining a diversified approach to the Group’s funding.
Capital 
The Group’s core equity tier 1 ratio (‘CET1’) remained unchanged in 2017 at 15.9% (2016: 15.9%), despite balance sheet growth and higher 
distributions to shareholders through buy-backs and enhanced dividend levels. The Group’s total capital ratio was 18.7% at September 2017 
(2016: 19.0%). Free cash resources totalled £305.5 million at the end of the period (2016: £383.1 million). During the year, the Group repaid its 
£110.0 million subordinated bond which matured in April 2017.
Enhancing shareholder returns on a sustainable basis is a key objective for the Group and during the year basic EPS increased by 6.4%. The 
reorganisation of the Group in 2017 confers a number of benefits but the impact on Group-level liquidity requirements is particularly pronounced. 
Most notably, the Company no longer needs to inject capital into Paragon Bank at the start of each year and the requirement to fund the credit 
enhancement needs of the former warehouse-to-securitisation financing model has been removed. Given the increased efficiency of the new 
financing model, the Board has reviewed the Group’s earnings retention requirements and concluded that it would be appropriate to reduce its 
dividend cover ratio from the current 3.00 times on a stepped basis. The cover ratio for 2017 will therefore be 2.75 times, and this is expected 
to fall to 2.50 times for the 2018 financial year, subject to the requirements of the business.
The increase in the Group’s EPS and annual dividend rate over the past five years, together with their compound annual growth rates (‘CAGR’) 
is set out below.
2017 2012 Increase CAGR
p p p %
EPS 43.10 24.20 18.9 12.3
Dividend 15.70 6.00 9.7 21.2
Dividend cover (times) 2.75 4.03
The Group will also adopt a formulaic approach to its interim dividend levels going forward, with the interim dividend per share for any given year 
being one half of the final dividend declared in the preceding period in normal circumstances.
The Group’s share buy-back programme has progressed well, with £165.0 million having been invested to date. The £150.0 million cumulative 
target announced with the 2016 preliminary results was extended to £165.0 million during 2017 given the strong cash flow. The programme will 
be extended by an additional £50.0 million in the current financial year, further enhancing shareholder returns.   PAGE 24  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
The business remains well funded, strongly capitalised and effectively placed to continue to deliver long term, sustainable returns through its 
robust operating model. The Group is positioned to respond quickly to the challenges and to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise 
given changes in the broader operating environment.

A3.2  Lending review
Following the Group’s reorganisation in September, its operations are organised into three divisions, based on product types and origination and 
servicing capabilities.
This review is based on the new organisational structure, and amounts from previous periods have been reanalysed on the basis of the new 
segments.
The Group’s investments in loans and the amounts invested in the year for each of its divisions are summarised below:
Advances and investments

Investments in loans

Idem Capital 98.0 208.8 611.4 667.8
1,951.4 1,647.9 11,124.1 10,737.5
The Group’s loan investments increased by 3.6% in the year, with new advances and investments 18.4% higher than in the previous 
financial year.
A3.2.1  Mortgages
The Group’s Mortgages division offers buy-to-let first charge and owner-occupied first and second charge mortgages on residential property in 
the UK. In all its offerings, it targets niche markets where its focus on detailed case-by-case underwriting and its robust and informed approach 
to property risk differentiate it from mass market lenders.
As part of the Group reorganisation all lending on residential property was brought into this division, creating efficiencies and enhancing the 
service delivered to our customers and intermediaries. 
Housing and mortgage market
The UK mortgage market is currently finely balanced and there is the potential for considerable volatility. However, the data would indicate that 
the market has been more robust than some media reports would suggest. Housing transactions, the key measure of market activity, have been 
improving through the year and monthly house purchase numbers are running at post-crisis highs. Mortgage transactions have also been on the 
increase, with advances increasing at a sharper rate than housing transactions. 
The strength of the first-time buyer segment, supported by the Government’s Help-to-Buy scheme, is clearly bolstering housing transactions 
in general and new build activity in particular. Gross mortgage lending, however, is also benefitting from growth in remortgaging activity which 
is being driven by increased levels of maturing products in extant mortgage portfolios as well as increased consumer sensitivity to potentially 
higher interest rates.  PAGE 25  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
This is demonstrated by the quarterly levels of mortgage approvals for purchase and remortgage over the last three years reported by the Bank 
of England, set out below.
Number of mortgage approvals
Bank of England
number
Purchase Remortgage
As a result of these activity levels, despite some ongoing weakness in London and the South, particularly for higher value properties, house 
prices across the country have seen modest increases in the period and the market remains stable.
Across the whole of the mortgage industry, the low interest rate environment has led to benign conditions, with low arrears and a negligible level 
of forced sales. Overall the economic environment for the mortgage market currently appears both positive and sustainable.
The downside risks centre on the impact of any potential economic downturn, whether as a result of the Brexit process or otherwise. The 
Group seeks to mitigate its exposure to such conditions through a robust approach to property valuation across all its brands, employing an 
experienced in-house property team who undertake around two thirds of valuations and conduct validation work on 100% of valuations by third 
party surveyors. The internally conducted surveys are subject to regular monitoring and the Risk and Compliance function includes qualified 
property risk resource.
Buy-to-let
The buy-to-let market in particular has been disrupted through a series of government and regulatory interventions, which are in the process of 
reshaping the sector. Significant changes have been seen to date, and the effects are yet to work themselves out fully. The principal changes 
have been: 
• the introduction of a stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let properties
• the restriction of tax relief on finance costs for buy-to-let landlords
• regulatory changes affecting buy-to-let lending
The stamp duty changes appear to have had the least effect, with landlords considering their investment in the long term, mitigating the impact.
Tax relief changes have had a marked effect on customer behaviour, with amateur landlords (those with fewer than four properties) moving 
away from the market, leading to a fall in the volume of buy-to-let transactions which seems to be establishing a new ‘normal’ level. The reaction 
of the more professional landlords, who constitute the Group’s main target customer base, has been different. Their focus has generally been 
to adopt defensive measures, including putting properties into corporate structures and focussing on high yielding properties such as homes 
in multiple occupation (‘HMOs’). This has led to a sharper distinction between professional landlord investors and other buy-to-let borrowers, 
which the Group regards as a positive development and one beneficial to its business model.
The regulatory changes in the year were implemented in two phases: 
•  From 1 January 2017 the PRA imposed common standards for affordability testing in the buy to-let sector, similar, in principle, to the 
approach adopted by the FCA for owner-occupied cases. Most lenders, including the Group, were able to adopt these changes without 
serious disruption
•  From 1 October 2017, lenders were required to underwrite buy-to-let cases on a much more specialised basis, differentiating between 
professional and amateur landlords, based on the number of properties owned with buy-to-let finance. This caused little disruption to the 
Group’s business model as the PRA approach was in line with that already adopted and the required specific changes were put in place in 
July 2017. The market in general was slow to reflect these changes in published criteria, leading to some disruption around the implementation 
date, due to lack of clarity on lenders’ requirements. At present some of this disruption continues
Overall the Group sees these changes as positive, with a more sharply focussed class of buy-to-let landlords emerging. These should be 
motivated to provide a better service to tenants and their funding requirements are a good match for the service offered by the Group, providing 
an opportunity for the Group to grow its market share, albeit in a potentially smaller market. PAGE 26  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Lending activity
The new lending activity in the segment during the year is set out below.
2017 2016
£m £m
First charge buy-to-let 1,399.9 1,161.0
First charge owner-occupied 3.9 -
Second charge 60.7 44.9
1,464.5 1,205.9
The Group’s buy-to-let lending increased by 20.6% year on year, despite the disruption in the market described above and the consequent 
pressure on volumes. The pipeline of buy-to-let loans in process at the year end was £604.2 million, an increase of 88.2% on the position a 
year earlier (2016: £321.1 million). It had reduced, however, from the level at the half year as a result of the market disruption caused by the 
implementation of the second phase of PRA reforms.
The Group launched its pilot offering in the specialist sector of the owner-occupied mortgage market during the year. This is intended to address 
customers who are poorly served by mainstream lenders and who might benefit from a more bespoke approach to underwriting, including 
customers with irregular incomes or more complex properties or those who might wish to borrow into retirement, but not sub-prime cases.
The Group’s approach to these cases involves a much more holistic assessment of the proposition, speaking directly to customers and their 
financial advisers to understand the case in the round. The Group initially worked with three intermediaries to prove the proposition, systems 
and processes were viable. The results so far are pleasing and the offering is now being expanded to a wider network of selected specialist 
intermediaries. Further increases in capacity will be phased in over the coming financial year, with the business not expected to reach its full 
capability until after the end of the 2018 financial year.
The Group’s second charge mortgage lending has increased 35.2% during the year, but that is largely as a result of starting from a low base. 
The second charge market is currently not large, with total lending of £979 million in the financial year reported by the Finance and Leasing 
Association (‘FLA’), and a significant part of this total does not fall within the Group’s risk appetite. For its new lending, the Group seeks to target 
the population of customers seeking to access equity in their property while protecting an existing beneficial first mortgage rate, rather than 
those seeking to refinance consumer debt and adopts a cautious approach to credit quality in this area.

At 30 September 2017 the balance on the Group’s mortgage portfolio was 2.7% higher than a year earlier. The annualised redemption rate 
on post 2010 buy-to-let mortgage assets at 22.7% (2016: 16.2%), has reached the levels seen before the credit crisis as the book matures. 
Redemption activity has been particularly high over the summer months, influenced by very attractive refinancing options on offer, as lenders 
have utilised the TFS to subsidise product pricing. The annualised redemption rate on pre-crisis lending, at 6.0%, has marginally reduced from 
the 6.2% seen in the year ended 30 September 2016.  PAGE 27  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts

Second charge 4.65% 4.87% 76.7 36.1
Legacy 2.02% 2.24% 6,386.3 6,831.2
Yields in the segment have tightened somewhat in the year as a result of competitive pressures and market interest rate movements, but 
remain broadly in line with expectations and at sustainable levels.
Arrears on the buy-to-let book as a whole have reduced in the year to 0.08% (2016: 0.11%), with arrears on post-2010 lending standing at 
0.02% (2016: 0.01%). These arrears remain very low compared to market performance, with UK Finance reporting arrears of 0.45% across the 
buy-to-let sector at 30 September 2017 (2016: 0.52%). This exemplary performance reflects the Group’s focus in underwriting on the credit 
quality and financial capability of its customers, underpinned by a detailed and thorough assessment of the value and suitability of the property 
as security.
Second charge arrears increased to 0.06% from zero in the year, as the book began to season, but remain negligible compared to market levels. 
The Group’s receiver of rent process for buy-to-let assets helps to reduce the level of bad debt. At the year end 821 properties were managed 
by a receiver on the customer’s behalf, a reduction of 13.2% since 2016 (2016: 946 properties) as cases on the old book resolve and post 2010 
cases perform well.
Outlook
The Group believes it is well placed to face the challenges of the mortgage market going forward. Aside from an economic downturn, the 
biggest risk to the business model is from further interventions in the buy-to-let sector. Exposure on owner-occupied lending is low, and the risk 
position on second charge lending has been carefully maintained. 
While arrears performance at the moment is exceptional, in the event of an economic downturn the Group believes its strong credit standards 
and robust assessment of security condition and value will afford it a high degree of protection. Average loan-to-value ratios on new buy-to-let 
lending remain at around 70% with stressed affordability levels in line with or above the PRA requirements. Continued strong rental demand 
and good affordability suggests the Group’s customers will be resilient in the face of anticipated rate rises.
The Group believes that the current trends in the buy-to-let market are likely to continue with the split between professional and amateur 
landlords becoming more marked and professional landlords increasingly dominant in the sector. This provides a good match for the Group’s 
offerings and 71.2% of applications at 30 September 2017 were from landlords the Group classes as professional (2016: 67.2%).
This trend can be seen in the analysis of the Group’s buy-to-let pipeline application numbers over the last three years.

The Group believes the division is well placed to deploy its core skills of bespoke assessment of credit risk, good customer service, expert 
understanding of property valuation and modern systems and processes, across a variety of niche markets in the residential mortgage field, 
as well as in its existing core buy-to-let specialism. These would be significantly large, underserved markets where detailed underwriting and 
the careful management of credit and property risk can produce a resilient and sustainable lending business with total lending in excess of 
£1.6 billion anticipated for 2018. PAGE 28  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
A3.2.2  Commercial Lending
Building on the asset finance operation acquired in 2015, the Group’s Commercial Lending division brings together a number of streams of 
mostly asset backed lending to, or through, commercial organisations. The principal customer focus of the division is on lending to SME and 
mid-sized corporate customers, which is an important differentiator from the rest of the Group’s business.
While asset and motor finance form the largest parts of the division’s operations and finance leasing is its principal product, offerings are 
tailored to respond to specific needs identified in the marketplace.
The Group recognises that whilst the asset finance market is wide and deep, covering some £75.1 billion of outstanding balances at 
30 September 2017 (2016: £70.7 billion) and £31.6 billion of advances in the year then ended, most of this funding is provided by commodity 
lenders. The Group targets niches within this market where its particular skill sets can be best applied.
Examples of such niches are the financing of waste collection vehicles for local authorities, construction equipment and complex veterinary 
equipment. Outside the leasing market the division also has niche offerings including invoice factoring, development finance and specialist 
lending.
Access to customers is generally though specialist brokers, including the Group’s in-house brokerage, Premier Asset Finance (‘Premier’), 
or equipment suppliers and the markets in which the division operates tend to be fragmentary, with different brokers focussed on different 
asset types.
The common themes of these diverse business lines are a reliance on understanding and engaging with the customer and the valuation of 
any security, together with expertise in collections and security realisation. In common with the rest of the Group, the division’s focus is on 
the maintenance of strong credit standards and it does not pursue business volumes at the expense of margins. The division relies heavily on 
specialist teams to address the separate business lines, either sourced externally or internally developed.

*2016 activity for 11 months since acquisition
The asset finance business has seen a 39.8% annualised growth in new advances in the first full year of the Group’s ownership, as changes 
made following the acquisition came into effect. Premier, acquired on 30 September 2016, has proved valuable as a source of new business, 
particularly in the business finance area. This has taken place against a backdrop of aggressive competition in the market and general economic 
nervousness in UK industry, leading to some reluctance by SMEs to take on new finance commitments.
The asset finance business also made a significant investment in assets for hire under operating leases, both term and spot, acquiring 
£12.9 million of assets to generate future income (2016: £8.7 million).
The motor finance business continues its development phase with a 50.4% increase in new lending as its distribution network expands. This 
rate of growth is expected to moderate as the business becomes more mature.
The development finance business, which provides funding for small scale property developments, was launched at the end of the previous 
year. It has seen significant growth as it moves from its pilot phase to a wider scale launch, expanding from its initial focus on London and the 
South East. PAGE 29  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts

systems developments supporting their growth. The development finance business saw its first projects successfully completed and paid 
down in the year and has seen significant investment in systems and specialist personnel. Across all business lines growth has been carefully 
controlled with credit quality and margins prioritised over expansion.

Yields in the segment have remained strong. While the figures for motor and development finance are affected by their growth trajectories, 
the decline in the yield in asset finance reflects its strategic repositioning under the Group’s ownership, to address the larger, higher quality but 
lower yielding mid-range segment of the market.
Arrears on the segment’s business remain low with arrears in the asset finance business at 0.97% and motor finance at 0.56% (2016: 0.82% 
and 0.09% respectively), comparable to those in the wider sector, with the FLA reporting average arrears for asset finance at 0.60% and car 
finance at 1.70% at 30 September 2017 (2016: 0.60% and 1.50%). 
Development finance accounts are monitored on a case-by-case basis by the Credit Risk function. At 30 September 2017, no accounts were in 
default and no defaults had been suffered in the year. The average loan to gross development value for the portfolio at the year end, a measure 
of security cover, was 60.6%.
Overall the charge for impairment in the segment was £0.1 million (2016: £0.8 million), representing both the quality of the lending and the 
Group’s success in realising security on defaulted cases.
Outlook
The division seeks to develop its businesses, both increasing the reach of its existing offerings and adding further lines or specialisms either 
organically or through M&A activity. It seeks to be responsive and flexible in addressing the market, but its UK focus means that it is exposed to 
a downturn in investment amongst UK business as a whole, particularly one affecting its core construction and broadcast sectors.
The coming year will see development of new product lines, including two already launched, aviation finance and structured lending.
The structured lending team was established to provide senior debt to the UK non-bank lending market. The business will deploy loans of up 
to £25.0 million to help support ‘best-in-class’ businesses working across consumer and commercial lending. The Group will work alongside 
clients to help fund their growth. Each transaction will be secured on underlying assets and structured using established robust methodologies. 
It is anticipated that each facility will generate attractive returns for shareholders and present a low risk way of accessing familiar and new 
markets. Structured lending is a means of addressing certain segments where the Group may be underweight or has no exposure at all and 
where working with a recognised industry expert would be preferable to setting up a business.
Aviation finance builds on the division’s existing asset finance lending expertise, supplemented with product-specific teams joining the business 
from outside. The first advance in this business was made in the first weeks of the new financial year.
Further potential niche markets have been identified which might be addressed through organic development using existing business 
processes, creation of a new separate business line, or acquisition in the field. PAGE 30  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Overall the division has a good platform on which to build and increasing scale will enable a better return to be generated from its resources, 
control framework and investments in systems and aggregate new advances of over £0.5 billion are expected in 2018.
A3.2.3  Idem Capital
The Group’s Idem Capital division includes its acquired consumer finance portfolios, together with legacy consumer portfolios originated 
before the credit crisis. 
The division’s focus is on acquiring portfolios where it can enhance value through its collections process and access to funding, using its 
analytical skills base, which it sees as a core differentiator, to identify and evaluate portfolios brought to market. Its principal area of focus over 
recent years has been on portfolios of UK paying secured and unsecured consumer finance balances.
Idem Capital has a strong capability in loan administration and an ability to self-develop systems, allowing it to respond to regulatory 
developments and more specialised portfolio requirements. Unlike many market participants, Idem Capital is able to deploy retail funding and 
securitisation funding to support its investment.
In the market the division’s strategy has been to seek better returns, with a greater interest in transactions with a bespoke aspect. It is also 
willing to consider transactions, deal by deal, on a partnership basis, having acted as a co-investor, servicer or both in various deals in the past.
Overall Idem Capital’s success rests on understanding assets, strong analytics, advanced servicing capabilities and the efficient use of funding. 
Lending activity
The portfolio purchase market has been busy in the year, with over 40 transactions in various asset classes coming to market. In transactions 
where it was successful, Idem Capital invested £98.0 million in loan portfolios (2016: £208.8 million). These portfolios comprised unsecured 
consumer finance balances. Activity in the asset sales market tends to be ‘lumpy’ and the level of investment will reflect the number, type and 
quality of portfolios offered, together with the levels of return other market participants are willing to accept.
The Group believes that its ability to accurately evaluate a potential acquisition is a core strength and it is not willing to compromise on credit 
quality or target return levels in pursuit of volumes. Idem Capital has participated in all the significant sales processes in the year in its target 
markets and remains on the panels of all the principal UK vendors.
The Group had also disposed of assets with a carrying value of £18.5 million during the year. These were assets where the Group had exhausted 
its collection procedures and therefore chose to dispose of the assets to other institutions whose systems are better set up to serve these 
customers and address such balances.
Performance
The value of the loan balances in the segment are set out below, analysed by business line.
30 September 30 September
2017 2016
£m £m
Second charge mortgage loans 392.3 472.7
Unsecured consumer loans 219.1 195.1
611.4 667.8
The reduction in balances is a result of the scale of realisations from the brought forward portfolio outstripping the pace of acquisitions in the 
year. 120 month Estimated Remaining Collections on acquired assets reduced from £740.7 million at 30 September 2016 to £688.8 million at 
the year end.
Average yields on the major product lines are set out below.
Average Yield Average Balance
2017 2016 2017 2016
£m £m
Second charge 13.13% 13.83% 432.6 435.9
Unsecured 17.73% 19.32% 237.7 210.2
Yields in the segment have remained stable. The reductions in the year can be attributed principally to mix variances as higher yielding seasoned 
portfolios amortise and new investments are made at yields below historic levels. PAGE 31  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
None of the division’s portfolios at the year end were regarded as materially underperforming, with strong overall cash generation. Operational 
improvements have been made in systems, including the launch of a new customer facing website designed to further enhance customer 
service by increasing contact, information levels and payment options. This development is also expected to generate operational efficiencies 
in future periods.
Arrears on the segment’s secured lending business remain in line with recent performance at 17.5% (2016: 17.8%), which while higher than the 
average for the sector reflect the seasoning of the balances, which are mostly more than ten years old. Average arrears for secured lending of 
10.7% at 30 September 2017 were reported by the FLA (2016: 12.4%). 
The Group monitors actual cash receipts from acquired portfolios against those forecast in the evaluation which informed the purchase price. 
Up to 30 September 2017 such collections were 109.3% of those forecast to that point (2016: 109.0%)
Overall the charge for impairment in the segment reduced to £1.5 million (2016: £2.1 million), representing the stable arrears position and the 
impact of improving house prices on secured provisioning.
Outlook
The Group expects the flow of sale transactions to continue into the new financial year. Its strategic focus in this market will be on transactions 
which are more idiosyncratic in nature and therefore make best use of its core skills in pricing, data, operations and account management in 
generating value.
While Idem Capital has the most significant experience in secured and unsecured consumer loan transactions, it has access to specialists in 
other asset classes across the Group, enabling it to bid on a wider range of asset classes. It will also look for opportunities to deploy retail and 
corporate funding, with access to these funding sources giving it a potential competitive advantage.
The business will continue to maintain its detailed and disciplined approach to evaluating, pricing and bidding on portfolios, not compromising 
on yields and risk and thereby generating appropriate shareholder value.
A3.3  Funding review
The Group’s reorganisation in the period represents a major stage in its transition from an entirely wholesale funded lender, with equity 
representing a high proportion of working capital, reflecting more closely a typical funding structure with retail deposits at its core.
The structural changes have enhanced access to deposit funding and facilitated a review of the Group’s equity and dividend strategy.
A3.3.1  Debt funding
During the year, the Group continued to pursue its strategy of making increased use of its retail savings capability.
The availability of central bank funding at attractive rates to support lending in the year impacted on the Group’s use of other wholesale funding, 
with no securitisation transactions taking place. The amount of warehouse facilities available for new lending was also reduced to take account 
of the increased availability of retail funding.
The Group’s funding at 30 September 2017 is summarised as follows:
2017 2016 2015
£m £m £m
Retail deposit balances 3,615.4 1,873.9 708.7
Securitised and warehouse funding 7,781.8 9,947.1 9,700.0
Central bank facilities 700.0 - -
Tier 2 and retail bonds 444.8 554.3 404.9
Total on balance sheet funding 12,542.0 12,375.3 10,813.6
Off balance sheet central bank facilities 109.0 108.8 -
12,651.0 12,484.1 10,813.6
The Group’s present medium term strategic funding objective is principally focussed on retail deposits, while optimising the use of central bank 
facilities. Securitisation will be used tactically if market conditions are favourable, or where it is appropriate for particular transactions. PAGE 32  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Retail funding
Retail deposits represent a reliable, cost-effective and scalable source of finance. As a consequence of the Group adopting its funding strategy, 
the volume of retail deposits has grown significantly during the year, with balances at 30 September 2017 reaching £3,615.4 million, an increase 
of 92.9% over the period (30 September 2016: £1,873.9 million). 
However, this represents only a small proportion of the UK savings market, with household savings balances reported by the Bank of England 
increasing by 1.3% in the year to 30 September 2017 to £1,120.8 billion (30 September 2016: £1,105.9 billion). This strong supply has helped 
to maintain the recent trend for low savings rates with the average annual interest on two year fixed interest bonds, reported by the Bank of 
England, having increased only from 1.00% in September 2016 to 1.26% in September 2017, in expectation of the autumn increase in bank 
base rates.
Paragon’s savings model provides customers with a range of deposit options, offering value for money and competitive rates, combined with 
the protection provided by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (‘FSCS’). It provides the Group with a stable funding platform, with a 
focus on term funding to manage interest rate risk and the ability to limit product availability to short periods of time. 
The Group’s straightforward approach and consistently competitive products have been recognised in the industry and by customers and 
Paragon was commended in the Best Online Savings Provider category at the 2017 Moneyfacts Consumer awards, the third consecutive year 
it has received this accolade.
In customer feedback 87% of those opening a savings account with Paragon in the year, who provided data, stated that they would ‘probably’ or 
‘definitely’ take a second product with Paragon (2016: 87%). The net promoter score in the same survey was +59, up from +51 in 2016.
Savings balances at the year end are analysed below.
Average interest rate Average initial balance Proportion of deposits
2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016
% % £000 £000 % %
Fixed rate deposits 1.89 2.11 24 28 74.0 71.1
Variable rate deposits 1.21 1.65 19 15 26.0 28.9
All balances 1.71 1.98 23 25 100.0 100.0
The average initial term of fixed rate deposits was 28 months (2016: 26 months).
Following the restructuring in the year, the scale of deposit-taking activity is expected to expand materially over the next few years.
Wholesale funding
The year has seen a scaling back of the Group’s wholesale funding. The Group’s strategic objective of creating a better balanced funding base, 
coupled with the availability of attractively priced funding from the Bank of England has meant that the Group has not accessed the public 
securitisation market since November 2015. 
At the same time, the quality of the Group’s loan assets has enabled three mortgage securitisations to be paid down, including one pre-credit 
crisis transaction, together with one of the Group’s pre 2007 consumer finance transactions. All were refinanced with retail deposits, releasing 
significant cash balances for use elsewhere in the Group. Further such refinancing transactions should be expected over the coming years. 
As a consequence of the increased focus on retail deposit funding, the Group’s warehouse capacity, which had been used to fund buy-to-let 
mortgage originations, was rationalised, reducing from £850.0 million at 30 September 2016 to £550.0 million at the year end, and further, to 
£350.0 million shortly thereafter. The remaining warehouse provides a standby capability and an alternative to retail deposit funding.
The reduction in the use of securitisation and warehouse facilities reduces the Group’s requirement to provide credit enhancement in these 
structures and releases working capital funds to the Group, where it can be used more effectively.
While the Group has not issued new securitisation debt in the year, it expects to do so in future, on a stategic basis when market conditions 
are favourable.
Central bank facilities
In the previous year the Group first accessed the borrowing facilities offered by the Bank of England, which provide flexible, low-cost 
collateralised funding designed to reinforce the transmission of low base rates to households and businesses. The Group drew down £108.8 
million under the Funding for Lending Scheme (‘FLS’) to support lending to SMEs, which increased to £109.0 million at 30 September 2017. The 
terms of this facility are such that neither the drawing or the liquidity provided appear on the Group’s balance sheet.
During the year the Group has made further use of Bank of England facilities, most significantly through drawings on the Term Funding Scheme 
(‘TFS’), with mortgage loans offered as security. The interest cost of TFS is very attractive compared with either retail deposits or securitisation 
and repayment is due four years after the drawing, in 2021. The Group uses the TFS to support new lending, rather than for the repayment of 
other facilities and total drawings are subject to a regulatory limit. PAGE 33  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
In common with many UK institutions, the Group has made extensive use of this facility and drawings have increased to £700.0 million at the 
end of the period (2016: £nil). Assets already pre-positioned with the Bank of England potentially give access to a further £114.3 million and the 
Group intends to optimise its use of this facility until the end of the drawdown window in February 2018.
Funding for Idem Capital assets
Idem Capital has continued its funding strategy of financing smaller scale acquisitions from the Group’s equity while keeping under review the 
opportunities to access retail funding for assets of appropriate quality and to introduce external funding when asset volumes and types make 
that economically appropriate.
Since 2015, Idem Capital has had a non-recourse funding facility with Citibank, which it uses to fund assets from time to time, releasing Group 
working capital. During the year drawings of £69.8 million were made on this facility. 
Certain legacy assets, principally second charge mortgage balances are also funded through pre-credit crisis securitisation structures. 
At 30 September 2017 the funding of the assets in the Idem Capital segment was distributed as shown below.
2017 2016 2015
£m £m £m
Purchased assets by funding source
External non-recourse funding 270.8 414.5 449.2
Retail deposit funding 247.0 250.6 -
Funded through Group resources 93.6 2.7 144.2
611.4 667.8 593.4
This demonstrates the flexibility in the Group’s funding for its debt purchase activities, and its ability to access third party and retail funding for 
appropriate transactions. This is particularly useful when bidding for performing portfolios, which the operation has targeted.
The assets funded through the Group also provide an opportunity to raise further liquidity, should it be needed.
Corporate funding
While the Group’s working capital has primarily been provided by equity since 2008, in recent years it has strategically expanded its use of 
corporate debt funding, allowing it to diversify its funding base and extend the tenor of its borrowings.
During the year, the Group paid down the £110.0 million Corporate Bond which matured in April 2017. This means that all the Group’s working 
capital debt funding has now been raised since the credit crisis.
The Group is rated by Fitch Ratings, and maintains its BBB- senior debt rating, with Fitch confirming this rating with a stable outlook on 
13 April 2017. On 25 September 2017, Fitch stated that the Group’s reorganisation has no immediate rating implications. The Group’s £1.0 billion 
Euro Medium Term Note Programme announced in January 2013 remains in place and continues to form part of the Group’s long-term funding 
strategy, although no issuance was made in the period. 
Further information on all the above borrowings is given in notes 45 to 49.
A3.3.2  Capital management
The Group has reviewed its capital management and maintenance policies following its reorganisation. The primary reliance on retail deposit 
funding in the new model fundamentally changes the working capital cycle of the Group, reducing the variability in working capital demand and 
hence enabling a reduction in working capital levels relative to the size of the balance sheet. 
The Group has continued to enjoy strong cash generation during the year. Available cash balances were £305.5 million at the year-end 
(30 September 2016: £383.1 million) (note 30) after investments in loan assets, share buy-backs and the repayment of the £110.0 million 
Corporate Bond. The Company sees opportunities to deploy capital to support organic growth and invest in portfolio purchases and potentially 
in further M&A opportunities, but recognises also the opportunity to return more of this cash to its shareholders.
Dividend and dividend policy
Following its review of capital, the Company has determined that it is appropriate to increase its normal level of dividends and will move from 
the previously announced policy of targeting a dividend cover ratio of 3.00 times, to 2.75 times in 2017 and then to 2.50 times in 2018, subject 
to the requirements of the business and the availability of cash resources.  PAGE 34  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
To provide greater transparency, the Company has also indicated that in future its interim dividend per share will normally be 50% of the 
previous final dividend, in the absence of any indicators which might make such a level of payment inappropriate.
In determining the level of dividend for the year, the Board has considered the dividend policy, but has also taken into account the Group’s 
strategy, capital requirements, principal risks, the level of available retained earnings in the Company, its cash resources and the objective of 
enhancing shareholder value.
On this basis, the Board is proposing, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 15 February 2018, a final dividend of 11.0 pence per 
share which, when added to the interim dividend of 4.7 pence, gives a total dividend of 15.7 pence per share for the year. This represents an 
increase of 16.3% from 2016, bringing the dividend cover to 2.75 times (2016: 3.00 times) (note 7(a)). 
The progress of the dividend for the year is shown in the chart below.
Dividend for the year (pence)
In respect of the years 2011 - 2017

Regulatory capital
The Group is subject to supervision by the PRA on a consolidated basis, as a group containing an authorised bank. As part of this supervision, 
the regulator will issue individual capital guidance setting an amount of regulatory capital, defined under the international Basel III rules, 
implemented through the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (‘CRD IV’), which the Group is required to hold relative to its risk 
weighted assets in order to safeguard depositors in the event of severe losses being incurred by the Group. 
The Group maintains extremely strong capital and leverage ratios, with a capital ratio of 18.7% at 30 September 2017 (2016: 19.0%) and a 
UK leverage ratio at 6.6% (2016: 6.3%) (note 7(d)), leaving the Group’s capital at 30 September 2017 comfortably in excess of the regulatory 
requirement. The CET1 ratio, 15.9% at 30 September 2017, remained stable in the period (2016: 15.9%), despite the effect of share buy-backs 
and dividends, as a result of the Group’s profit in the period and the actuarial gain on the defined benefit pension plan. The Group’s medium term 
CET1 target is 13.0%.
The Group notes the consultation paper issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (‘BCBS’) on 15 December 2015 regarding the 
proposed amendments to the Standardised Approach (‘SA’) for assessing the capital adequacy of institutions. The most material proposal for 
the Group relates to a potential increase in the risk weightings applicable to buy-to-let lending assets. The Group considers that the proposed 
risk weightings do not properly reflect the strong credit performance of the asset class in the UK and has engaged with both the PRA and the 
BCBS as part of the consultation process. The BCBS has also issued a consultation paper in March 2016, proposing revisions to the Internal 
Ratings Basis (‘IRB’) for assessing capital, which is based on firms’ own internal calculations and subject to supervisory approval. The proposals 
may serve to limit the comparative advantage available to IRB users over SA users through the use of floors. Final announcements on the 
results of these consultations are still expected and the Group will be closely monitoring developments as they progress.
The Group also notes the steps taken by the PRA towards using its assessment of Pillar 2 capital to ameliorate the perceived capital advantage 
of IRB banks over those using the SA, which they regard as distortive to the market. The regulator published its final policy statement on this in 
October 2017, and the Group is considering its potential impact.
Notwithstanding the outcome of these consultations, the Group has substantial performance data and excellent credit metrics to support the 
adoption of an IRB approach for determining appropriate risk weightings for its buy-to-let mortgage assets. Other UK institutions currently 
using an IRB approach for their buy-to-let portfolios achieve materially lower risk weightings than the 35% required by the present SA, with PRA 
benchmark figures, most recently updated in October 2017, being typically in the low to mid-teen percentages. 
In addition to the potential capital advantages from adopting the IRB approach, the Group sees broader business benefits from adopting the 
disciplines required by IRB as a core part of its risk management structure and it has continued to progress a project to prepare an application 
to the PRA to adopt an IRB in future. This will build on the Group’s existing core competencies in credit risk and data handling and should lead to 
further enhancements in the internal risk governance framework. 
The Group expects to be in a position to apply formally for IRB authorisation for its buy-to-let portfolio in early 2019. This will be the first portfolio 
for which authorisation is sought, with further asset classes being added on a phased basis to achieve the coverage required by the IRB rules. PAGE 35  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Gearing and share buy-backs
The Group’s reorganisation during the year, coupled with the strong capital base and low leverage in the Company’s balance sheet, provide 
the opportunity for the business to reduce its over-reliance on equity capital, improving returns for shareholders. The future requirement to 
raise debt for liquidity purposes has been reduced by its access to retail deposit funding and the Group is able to take a long term view of 
opportunities available to it in the corporate debt markets to optimise its funding, working capital and regulatory capital position over time.
At the same time the Company will carefully monitor any excess equity position and consider whether any adjustment is required, either through 
further changes in the dividend policy or through share buy backs.
An analysis of the Group’s central funding between corporate debt and equity (note 7(c)) is shown below.
Balance of central funding resources
At 30 September 2017
percentage
Equity Debt
The reversal of the trend above from equity toward debt is a result of the raising of the 2016 Tier 2 Bond ahead of the repayment of the 
£110.0 million Corporate Bond, leading to an element of double funding across the previous year end.
In November 2014 the Group announced a share buy-back programme, which had been extended to £150.0 million by November 2016, and was 
subsequently extended to £165.0 million in July 2017. 
The size of the programme is reviewed periodically to take account of anticipated investment opportunities and the balance of the Group’s 
debt and equity capital resources. During the year the Group bought back 15.3 million of its ordinary shares at a cost of £65.5 million 
(note 57), these shares being held in treasury. The Board intends to extend the programme by up to £50.0 million in the financial year ending 
30 September 2018. These shares will also be initially held in treasury but may be cancelled subsequently.
The Company currently has the necessary shareholder approval to undertake such share buy-backs and will propose the appropriate renewal 
of the relevant authority at its 2018 Annual General Meeting, when a special resolution seeking authority for the Company to purchase up to 
26.5 million of its own shares (10% of the issued share capital excluding treasury shares) will be put to shareholders.
Capital Outlook
The Board keeps under review the appropriate level of capital for the business to meet its operational requirements and strategic development 
objectives. The strength of its business lines, the diversification which has been achieved in the funding base in recent years and the further 
opportunities for growth and sustainability opened up by the group reorganisation, have now created the foundations upon which to develop 
the Group’s next phase of growth. PAGE 36  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts

Total operating income increased by 3.6% to £252.8 million (2016: £244.0 million). Within this, net interest income increased by 4.2% to 
£232.6 million from the £223.2 million recorded in the year ended 30 September 2016. The increase reflects growth in the size of the average 
loan book, which rose by 5.1% to £10,930.8 million (2016: £10,400.0 million) (appendix A). 
Net interest margins (‘NIM’) in the year ended 30 September 2017 reduced marginally to 2.13% compared to the 2.15% in the previous year 
(appendix A), driven by increased funding costs from the £150.0 million corporate bond issued in 2016, which attracted interest of £10.9 million 
in the year, reducing NIM by 0.10%. The Group expects NIM to expand by between 0.05% and 0.10% in 2018.
Other operating income was £20.2 million for the year, compared with £20.8 million in 2016. The reduction principally results from lower levels 
of third party servicing income, where previously serviced assets were acquired in the previous financial year, partly offset by broker income 
from the Premier business acquired on 30 September 2016.
Operating expenses increased by 10.6% to £102.3 million from £92.5 million reported in the previous year, partly reflecting the increase in the 
average number of employees to 1,317, a 5.4% rise (2016: 1,249) and the acquisition of Premier. The year has also seen significant investments 
in systems and personnel in order to support the launch of new products and the expansion of existing business lines. This resulted in the overall 
cost:income ratio increasing to 40.5% from 37.9% for the corresponding period last year (appendix B), although it remains significantly below 
the industry average.
The Board remains focused on controlling operating costs through the application of rigorous budgeting and monitoring procedures. Costs of 
between £105.0 million and £115.0 million are anticipated for the Group in 2018 and the Group expects the overall cost:income ratio to improve 
over time as acquired and start-up operations are integrated into the Group and it starts to see the benefits of income growth from its new and 
expanded operations. PAGE 37  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
The charge of £5.3 million for loan impairment has decreased from that for 2016 (2016: £7.7 million). As a percentage of average loans to 
customers (appendix A) the impairment charge remains broadly stable at 0.05% compared to 0.07% in 2016. The Group has seen favourable 
trends in arrears performance over the period, both in terms of new cases reducing and customers correcting past arrears, whilst increasing 
property values have served to reduce overall exposure to losses on enforcement of security. The loan books continue to be carefully managed 
and the credit performance of the buy-to-let book remains exemplary.
Yield curve movements during the period resulted in hedging instrument fair value net losses of £0.4 million (2016: £0.6 million net losses), 
which do not affect cash flow. The fair value movements of hedged assets or liabilities are expected to trend to zero over time, as such this item 
represents a timing difference. The Group remains economically and appropriately hedged. 
Corporation tax has been charged at the rate of 19.1%, a broadly similar level compared with 19.0% for the previous year. For the next financial 
year Paragon Bank is expected to reach the threshold for the Bank Tax Surcharge and will pay an additional 8.0% tax on the excess of its 
company profit over £25.0 million. This is expected to increase the Group’s overall tax charge.
Profits after taxation of £117.2 million (2016: £116.0 million) have been transferred to shareholders’ funds, which totalled £1,009.4 million at the 
year end (2016: £969.5 million), representing a tangible net asset value of £3.45 per share (2016: £3.12) and an unadjusted net asset value of 
£3.84 per share (2016: £3.50) (Appendix D).
A3.4.2  Segmental results
Following the group reorganisation in September 2017, the Group now analyses its results between three segments, which are the principal 
divisions for which performance is monitored:
• Mortgages, including the Group’s buy-to-let, and owner-occupied first and second charge lending and related activities
•  Commercial Lending, including the Group’s motor finance and other equipment leasing activities, together with other offerings targeted 
towards SME customers
• Idem Capital, including loan assets acquired from third parties and legacy assets which share certain credit characteristics with them
The Group’s central administration and funding costs, principally the costs of service areas, establishment costs, and bond interest have not 
been allocated.
Results for the year have been presented on the basis of the new segments and comparative amounts restated accordingly.
The underlying operating profits of these business segments are detailed fully in note 14 to the annual report and are summarised below.
2017 2016

Idem Capital 75.9 79.0
233.3 221.2
Unallocated central costs (88.1) (77.4)
145.2 143.8
Mortgages
Trading activity during the year in the Mortgages division was very strong, with the segmental profit at £143.3 million, up 7.6% from the previous 
year (2016: £133.2 million). This increase arose both from increases in the loan book and from improved funding costs as the business made 
more use of retail funding.
Commercial Lending
Segmental profit in Commercial Lending increased 56.7% in the year to £14.1 million (2016: £9.0 million) as the asset finance operation acquired 
in 2016 contributed a full year’s activity to the results. The Premier brokerage business, acquired on 30 September 2016 also made its first 
contribution. Loan assets were substantially increased, especially in motor and asset finance, with the segment’s loans to customers increasing 
49.0% over the year.
Idem Capital
The Idem Capital division’s portfolios continued to perform well in the year to 30 September 2017. However, the level of new investment was 
offset by the scale of reductions in the brought forward balance, reducing earnings marginally, which coupled with the reduction in third party 
servicing income noted above, reduced segment profit by 3.9% to £75.9 million (2016: £79.0 million). PAGE 38  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts

An analysis of the Group’s financial assets by type is shown in note 32. Movements in the Group’s loan asset balances are discussed in the 
lending review section (Section A3.2).
Movements in derivative financial assets arise principally as a result of the effect of changes in exchange rates on instruments forming cash 
flow hedges for the Group’s floating rate notes. These movements do not impact on the Group’s results.
Cash flows from the Group’s securitisation vehicle companies and the acquired portfolios remain strong. These, together with debt raisings, 
financed further investments in loan portfolios, the capital requirements of Paragon Bank and credit enhancement for mortgage originations. 
Cash was also utilised in the share buy-back programme, which commenced during December 2014 and where £166.2 million (including costs) 
had been deployed by 30 September 2017. Free cash balances were £305.5 million at 30 September 2017 (2016: £383.1 million) following the 
repayment of the Group’s £110.0 million corporate bond in the year (note 30).
Movements in the Group’s funding are discussed in the funding review section (Section A3.3).
The accounting value of the deficit in the Group’s defined benefit pension plan has reduced significantly over the year ended 
30 September 2017. The triennial valuation of the Plan was completed in the period and the actual experience of the scheme membership over 
the three years ended 31 March 2016 was incorporated into the valuation under International Accounting Standard (‘IAS’) 19. Gilt yields also 
increased over the year and together these resulted in the deficit under IAS 19 falling to £29.8 million (2016: £58.4 million). A corresponding 
actuarial gain of £29.0 million before tax was recognised in other comprehensive income (2016: loss of £37.2 million). PAGE 39  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
While the valuation under IAS 19 is that which is required to be disclosed in the accounts, pension trustees generally use the technical provisions 
basis as provided in the Pensions Act 2004 to measure scheme liabilities. On this basis, the valuation at the triennial valuation date was 
£18.0 million and this had reduced to £14.9 million at 30 September 2017, representing an 87.0% funding level. 
A3.5  Operational review
A3.5.1  Management and people
The Group has always recognised that its people are its most important asset and are key to its future growth and development. The learning 
and development of its employees, together with a rigorous recruitment process are a key part of the Group’s organic growth strategy and 
underpins the strong progress it has made. It retains its Gold Investor in People status, reflecting the quality of its internal processes, and during 
the year has continued to act, by invitation, as an Investor in People Champion, sharing its experience with other businesses. This places it in the 
top 1% of companies in the UK for people development. 
The Group prides itself on the fact that its people remain with it for a long time. Its annual employee attrition rate of 13.2% is below the national 
average and 28.8% of its people have over ten years service, with 9.3% having achieved over 20 years with the Group. We believe this is due to 
providing quality development opportunities and creating a place where people want to work, which has meant that knowledge and experience 
have been retained in each of our specialist areas. We believe our people are well positioned to support the Group’s future growth strategy.

The Group is proud to have signed the Women in Finance Charter, sponsored by HM Treasury, during the year. The Charter’s objectives reflect 
the Group’s own aspirations in the field of gender diversity and the Group published its targets under the Charter during the year.
The Group is making good progress and will issue its first report under the Charter in January 2018.  The Group notes the publication of the 
Hampton-Alexander (‘HA’) review on gender diversity during the year. The Group believes that its Women in Finance objectives are consistent 
with the review’s recommendation and notes that its proportion of female senior managers at the year end, as defined by HA, was 31.4% 
(2016: 29.2%).  
The Group has calculated its gender pay gap at April 2017, as required by law. This calculation shows that median female pay in the Group was 
30.4% less than the median male pay. This is broadly in line with the results reported by the few financial services companies to publish their 
results so far and narrower than the 33.7% gap for the sector reported by the Office of National Statistics in their Annual Survey of Hours and 
Earnings published in October 2017. 
The Group will be analysing its gender pay gap data as part of its Women in Finance initiative to determine if there are areas where urgent action 
is required, but preliminary results suggest where groups of similar positions exist, there is no evidence of systematic gender bias on pay.
During the year, as part of the preparations for the Group reorganisation, the Board, initially through the Nomination Committee, gave in-depth 
consideration to the appropriate Board and governance structure for the reorganised Group. It concluded that it was appropriate to invite two 
independent non-executive directors of the Bank, Patrick Newberry and Finlay Williamson, to join the Board and to appoint two additional 
non-executive directors, particularly looking to increase the Board’s experience and skills in retail banking and risk, as well as improving the 
Board’s diversity.
As a result, Barbara Ridpath and Graeme Y orston, together with the two Bank directors, joined the Board on 20 September 2017. The four newly 
appointed directors bring a wealth of experience to the Board, including retail banking experience. PAGE 40  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Barbara brings listed PLC experience and a strong financial background as well as experience in operational risk and financial ethics, having 
worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Standard & Poor’s and JP Morgan. She is currently a director of St Paul’s Institute which 
examines moral and ethical aspects of finance and economics, and a non-executive director of ORX, a trade association for operational 
risk professionals.  
Graeme is a former Chief Executive of the Principality Building Society, which operates in many of the same markets as the Group. He 
has over 43 years experience in the financial services industry and held a number of senior roles with Abbey National including leading IT , 
change management and call centre activities. His experience will enhance the Board’s understanding of operational and customer issues in 
retail banking.
In appointing Patrick Newberry and Finlay Williamson to the Board, their experience of seeing the Bank through its early development, the 
launch of its various product lines and the establishment of its relationship with the regulator, is retained. This will be of great value to the Board 
in its strategic considerations for future developments. Patrick and Finlay also have a broad knowledge of the Group’s operations which will 
enable them to contribute strongly to the Board immediately.   
Before joining the Paragon Bank board, Patrick spent 25 years with PricewaterhouseCoopers as a consulting and regulatory partner, focusing 
on the financial services industry, adding to the Board’s regulatory experience. Finlay is a former Finance Director of Virgin Money, having 
previously held a number of senior finance roles in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. He brings significant experience of finance, management 
and accounting in the UK retail banking industry to the Group.
The Group’s succession planning strategy has also been an important area of focus during the year, with all Board and executive management 
roles together with their direct reports identified from a leadership and specialist perspective. Immediate successors are in place for these roles 
for the short term to provide business continuity and longer term succession plans are being developed for those with career aspirations and 
strong potential. This area will remain a priority for the Board, with the assistance of the Nomination Committee, during the forthcoming year.
A3.5.2  Risk
The effective management of risk is crucial to the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. It operates a risk governance framework, 
designed around a formal three lines of defence model (business areas, Risk and Compliance function and Internal Audit) supervised at 
Board level.
The Risk Management framework was reviewed in detail during the year as part of the preparations for the Group’s internal reorganisation. In 
particular, the Board reviewed its procedure for setting and managing risk appetites, together with the risk appetites themselves. 
The first line of defence has continued to exercise effective control of the risks arising from the Group’s operational activities. Supported by 
the Risk and Compliance function, further progress has been made in the year by business areas in embedding the Group’s risk management 
framework, including enhancements to risk event reporting, risk and control self-assessments and the development of key risk indicators.
The Group has continued to strengthen its second line risk management capabilities including in areas such as cyber security risk, credit risk 
modelling and data protection. The Risk and Compliance division now includes dedicated functions responsible for the oversight of Credit Risk, 
Property Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risk, Operational Risk, IT and Cyber Security, and Financial Crime. To progress its objective of obtaining 
regulatory approval for the implementation of an IRB approach to credit risk, the Risk and Compliance function also has a Director of IRB and 
supporting specialist resource.
As part of the Group’s reorganisation, the former Group and Bank Risk and Compliance functions were integrated, helping to remove 
unnecessary duplication and thereby maximise the effectiveness of the second line of defence. 
The principal challenges in the risk environment faced by the Group during the year include:
• The potential impact of the proposals on capital regulation from the BCBS
• Execution and transitional risks arising from the recent major internal reorganisation 
• The impact of continuing uncertainty as to the terms on which the UK will leave the EU in March 2019
• The impact of fiscal changes on the demand for buy-to-let mortgages in the UK
• Changes in the regulatory environment relating to the underwriting of buy-to-let mortgages 
• Continuing transitional risks arising from the integration and expansion of the acquired Asset Finance business 
•  Heightened cyber-security risks as a result of the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber-attacks affecting the financial services 
sector 
•  Major regulatory developments including the implementation of the fourth Money Laundering Directive and the impending implementation 
of the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’)
The Group continues to closely monitor its exposure to current and emerging risks as they develop and considers itself well placed to mitigate 
their impact.
Further details regarding the governance model, together with the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, the ways in which they 
are managed and mitigated and the extent to which these have changed in the year are detailed within Section B6 of this annual report. PAGE 41  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
A3.5.3  Regulation
The Bank is authorised by the PRA and regulated by the PRA and the FCA. The Group is subject to consolidated supervision by the PRA and a 
number of its subsidiaries are authorised and regulated by the FCA. As a result, current and projected regulatory changes, particularly revisions 
to the Basel supervisory regime, continue to pose a significant risk for the Group. The governance and risk management framework within the 
Group has therefore been developed to ensure that the impacts of all new regulatory requirements are clearly understood and mitigated as far 
as possible.  Regular reports on key regulatory developments are received at both executive and board risk committees.
Whilst the Group is impacted by a broad range of prudential and conduct regulations, given the nature of its operations, the following are of 
particular note:
•  The PRA completed the implementation of major policy changes to underwriting standards for buy-to-let mortgage contracts during 2017. 
These require firms to assess whether the rental income derived from the mortgaged property is sufficient to support the monthly interest 
cost of the loan payments using an interest coverage ratio (‘ICR’) test. In addition, supplementary underwriting requirements apply for 
“portfolio landlords” which the PRA has defined as borrowers with four or more distinct, mortgaged, buy-to-let properties. As a result of its 
extensive experience within the buy-to-let sector and its historically conservative approach to underwriting, the Group was able to begin 
operating in line with the new requirements well ahead of the regulatory deadline
•  In March 2017, the FCA issued a policy statement to complete the consultation process regarding Payment Protection Insurance (‘PPI’) that 
it began in 2015. This included setting a deadline of 29 August 2019 by which consumers will need to make PPI complaints and new rules 
and guidance on the handling of PPI complaints. The Group has assessed the operational and financial implications arising from the policy 
statement which it does not consider to be material
•  The PRA has updated its supervisory statement setting out the approach to strengthening individual accountability in banking under 
the Senior Managers Regime (‘SMR’). Whilst the Bank has fully implemented the regime, the Group is conscious of its extension to other 
Financial Services and Markets Acts firms with effect from 2018. It is therefore taking appropriate steps to ensure it is able to comply with 
the requirements
•  In June 2017, the PRA published a policy statement on IRB residential mortgage risk weights.  This has been incorporated into the Group’s 
IRB project approach
•  In July 2017, the PRA published the results of its review of consumer credit lending, expressing concern that firms’ credit models might not 
always fully consider a borrower’s total indebtedness nor how their ability to repay could be affected in the future. The Group has reviewed 
its approach in this area and is confident with the robustness of its assessment processes and controls
•  The GDPR will come into force with effect from May 2018 and represents the most significant revision to data protection legislation for 
several decades. The Group is therefore taking appropriate steps to ensure it will be compliant with the new legislation by the required 
deadline
Whilst the Group, along with the rest of the UK corporate sector does not have clear visibility on potential regulatory changes that may be 
introduced following the UK’s decision to leave the EU, it does not have any EU passporting issues that need to be considered. 
A3.6  Conclusion
In recent years Paragon’s business model has undergone significant change as it transitioned from a non-bank monoline lender into a retail 
funded banking group. A diversification strategy has led to the development of six new lending product lines within three years and the formation 
of a bank to establish a deposit funding franchise, which in 2017 saw balances exceed £3.6 billion. The transition of the model developed further 
this year with the structural reorganisation, which effectively saw the Bank re-positioned at the top of the Group subsuming virtually all the 
business’ assets and liabilities. This structure has provided numerous immediate benefits to the operating model and will improve funding 
efficiencies and capital mobility over time. The business is now better positioned to exploit the increasing opportunities in the UK retail banking 
market as it structurally shifts in favour of specialist lenders which can display a greater understanding of the markets, products and customers 
they serve.
In 2017 Paragon has, alongside this transition, witnessed strong growth across all products with total lending increasing by 29% to £1.9 billion. 
Buy-to-let lending benefitted from the increased professionalisation of the sector, a trend that is expected to continue following further 
regulatory change. Commercial Lending also experienced strong growth following investment in technology and distribution in the year. 
Notwithstanding this growth, and the benign credit environment, the Group is maintaining a firm discipline on risk and pricing, being cognizant 
of the potential for more uncertain times ahead.
With a strong capital base, exemplary asset quality, increasingly diversified funding, and a broadening product range supported by a more 
financially efficient operating model, the Group is well positioned to exploit the opportunities and manage the challenges ahead.
