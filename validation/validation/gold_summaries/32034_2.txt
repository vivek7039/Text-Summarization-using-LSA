 HIGHLIGHTS
TRANSITION COMPLETED
Operational and strategic highlights
• The Company’s transition to a fully self-publishing 
business model was completed in November 2016 
with the successful launch of Frontier’s second 
franchise, Planet Coaster. In July 2017 Planet Coaster’s 
first paid additional downloadable content was launched.
• Elite Dangerous, which launched in December 2014, 
continues to perform well. In June 2017 the franchise’s 
addressable audience was further expanded with 
release on the Sony PlayStation 4 platform.
• Frontier’s next major game franchise, based on 
the Jurassic World movie franchise, was revealed 
in August 2017. Jurassic World Evolution is planned 
for launch in summer 2018 alongside the movie 
launch of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.
• £17.7 million was raised in July 2017 through a strategic 
investment from Tencent, a leading Internet and 
interactive entertainment company based in China. 
This will improve and accelerate Frontier’s growth 
into the key Chinese market and help drive scale-up 
of the business.
Financial highlights

(FY16: £21.4 million) as the launch of the Planet Coaster

annual sales.

(FY16: £21.1 million) accounted for 97% of total

(FY16: £1.2 million) representing an operating 
margin of 21% (FY16: 6%) and EBITDA increased

• Operating cash flow (operating profit excluding 
non-cash items, less investments in franchises and 
other intangible assets) was an inflow of £3.4 million 
(FY16: outflow of £2.7 million).

to £12.6 million (FY16: £8.6 million). Following the 
£17.7 million strategic investment by Tencent the
