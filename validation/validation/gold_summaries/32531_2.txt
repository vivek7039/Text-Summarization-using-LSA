up 7.1%, in line with our 
expectations
• Net debt of £109.3 million

focused on markets with 
long‑term growth drivers where 
the Group can be market leader

Superconducting Technology, 
and announced sale of

tax on a continuing basis in

1. Throughout these Financial Statements we make reference to adjusted numbers. These are presented as, in the opinion of the Directors, they present a clearer picture of the business performance. 
A full definition of adjusted numbers can be found in Note 1. Where we make reference to organic numbers these exclude the effect of acquisitions and disposals. Where we make reference to 
constant currency numbers these are prepared using the exchange rates which prevailed in the previous year rather than the actual exchange rates which prevailed in the year.
