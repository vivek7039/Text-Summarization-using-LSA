Q&A WITH  
THE CEO
Kevin Bradshaw
What are the three key things you  
have learned in your first five months 
with Northgate?
KB My first impressions on joining are that Northgate is a 
fundamentally good, well positioned business, with great 
people that have a real desire to serve our customers well 
and in turn deliver strong returns for our shareholders. 
There is however, work to be done and I am excited by the 
challenges that lie ahead. 
What is your vision for the Group  
over the medium term?
KB Over the first five months I have managed to spend 
time across our network with people working in all areas 
of the business. I believe that the potential for Northgate is 
very significant and that we are a business that is capable 
of delivering good long term growth in cash flows with 
returns well ahead of our cost of capital. The strategic review 
on pages 6 to 39 highlights four key growth priorities to 
deliver these returns. The first area that needs attention is, of 
course, the UK business and I have already started to address 
this with self-help actions and leadership changes. 
What have been the reasons for the 
reduction in vehicles on hire in the UK?
KB Competition has certainly intensified but our market 
research concludes that the rental market has grown by 
c.6% a year over the last three years. Reductions in vehicles 
on hire in our business have been broad-based across the 
range of customer sizes, industry sectors and geography. 
Some critical key weaknesses have persisted in the execution 
of our sales and marketing efforts and I have put in measures 
to address these going forward.
What are your key sustainability 
priorities over the medium term?
KB We constantly strive to reduce environmental impacts 
to ensure we are building a sustainable business. Over the 
medium term I will encourage further initiatives around 
energy usage and waste management to ensure we continue 
to progress.

How do you envisage Brexit  
impacting the Group?
KB It is currently unclear what, if any, impact Brexit will 
have on the Group. Economic growth will drive demand 
and on the other hand our flexible product lends itself well 
to periods of uncertainty. Under any scenario the Group 
has a secure funding base and robust balance sheet which 
underpins our confidence for the future.
