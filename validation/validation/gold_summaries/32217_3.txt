 Chairman’s statement
I am delighted with the progress the Group has shown this year in 
terms of profit growth, with our first large acquisition trading well. 
There are good prospects for the coming year as we increase our 
market share.
Review of the year
Over the last few years the Group has 
been developing a growing pipeline of 
prospective business. Bringing a number 
of these prospects on stream during the 
year, as well as a keen focus on 
maintaining high-levels of service for 
existing introducers, allowed the business 
to grow over the period. I was particularly 
pleased to see us organically grow our 
transactional volumes by 4% while the 
market shrank in volume terms by 13%.
 
There were challenging times with the 
changes in the buy-to-let regulations, 
followed by the slow down post EU 
referendum. However, this was less 
prolonged than initially feared and the 
housing market returned to more normal 
levels in the autumn, although the longer-
term issue of a lack of housing stock for 
sale is still a factor. 
The business has developed and 
launched a new panel management 
solution for lenders which has been well 
received and has resulted in a number of 
new contracts being won. Some of these 
contracts have only recently gone live and 
I am excited by the opportunities for the 
business in this area.
Final dividend
Subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 
28 July 2017 , the board proposes a final 
dividend of 1.10p per share, payable on 
4 August 2017 to those shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 
7 July 2017 . This, together with interim 
dividend of 1.10p per share already paid, 
takes total proposed distributions relating 
to the year ending 31 March 2017 to 2.20p 
per share.
Acquisition of Conveyancing Alliance 
Holdings Limited (CAL)
The Group was delighted CAL joined us  
in December 2016. Harpal Singh and 
John Phillips have done an excellent job  
in building a profitable business with an 
excellent reputation; their openness to 
improving both our businesses’ 
profitability is welcome.
 
CAL provides similar conveyancing 
services to United Legal Services in the 
mortgage broker and estate agency 
channels, but with some service and 
brand differences which will be 
maintained. Since acquisition CAL has 
continued to grow and has contributed  
to the overall Group’s profitability in the 
year under review.
Board changes
As trailed in the last Annual Report, 
Nigel Hoath, founder of the Group, 
stepped down from his position as 
Non-executive Director in August. 
Again, our thanks go to Nigel for his 
contribution to building the business. 
Outlook
The prospects for the housing market and 
the wider economy remain uncertain but 
with Brexit two years away there appears 
to be a general feeling of just getting on 
with things. While there was a fall in 
housing transactions last year, the OBR 
is predicting a modest increase this year. 
Whatever the backdrop, the business 
has a good pipeline of prospects and will 
continue to help its existing introducers 
to grow their business. The Group is 
focused on providing the customer with 
an excellent experience and will continue 
to develop products and services which 
further enhance this.
The Group has had another busy year 
bringing on new clients while coping with 
changing market conditions. We are very 
much a people business and everyone 
has been asked to row just a little harder 
during the year and I am delighted that 
they have risen to the challenge. I would 
like to thank all our staff for their 
adaptability and enthusiasm. We have 
been able to increase the number of 
employees who hold options during the 
year meaning that two-thirds of our staff 
now hold options enabling them to share 
in our success.
 
The team at ULS looks forward to the 
coming year.
