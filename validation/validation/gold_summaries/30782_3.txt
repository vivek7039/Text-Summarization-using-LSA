 of our strategic and business goals, providing leadership to the 
business on culture, values and ethics, affording strong oversight 
of risk management and making certain there is alignment with 
shareholder interests and effective shareholder relations. 
The aim of this report is to provide shareholders with a clear 
perspective of your Board’s approach to corporate governance, how 
we have complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code ('Code’) 
and the work of the Board and its Committees during 2017 .
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENTS
2017 has been a year of particular focus on corporate 
governance in the UK with scrutiny from businesses, the 
government and the wider public. The Board have paid close 
attention to these developments including the Government’s 
Corporate Governance Green Paper, the BEIS Select Committee 
inquiry into corporate governance and the FRC’s consultation on 
proposed amendments to the Code. We noted the proposals with 
interest and are reviewing these to ensure any changes can be 
implemented in due course and strengthen the governance 
framework as we continue to operate in an ever-evolving 
environment. 
We remain strongly supportive of the principle of boardroom 
diversity and have continued to be mindful of the 
recommendations by the Hampton Alexander Review, which 
builds on the Lord Davies Review into 'Women on Boards'. The 
Group also supports the Parker Review ‘Beyond One by ‘21’ 
recommendation in respect of ethnically diverse director 
representation on boards. More details about the diversity of our 
Board can be found in the report of the Nomination Committee 
on page 74.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
Succession planning has continued to be a key focus for the 
Board. The Nomination Committee maintained its focus on the 
NED refreshment programme and on evaluating the composition 
of the Board and its Committees. We have reviewed the necessary 
skills required to address the evolving and changing needs of our 
business. It is my intention to continue to ensure that we maintain 
a Board that works effectively and cohesively under my leadership. 
The Nomination Committee deliberated on a broad range of 
candidates to ensure individuals with wide-ranging experience, 
expertise and attributes were considered to support the existing 
skills on the Board and to support the continued growth and 
success of the Group. More information on the role and activity of 
the Nomination Committee is detailed on pages 72 to 74.
As announced on 2 March 2017 , Alan Brown stepped down from 
the Board on 24 May 2017 after completing six years’ service as a 
Non-Executive Director. We further announced on 27 July 2017 
that Michael Wareing, after serving for over six years as the Chair 
of the Audit Committee and as the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director would step down from the Board on 30 
September 2017 . I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
both Alan and Michael for their dedicated service and valuable 
contribution since joining the Board in 2011.
On 1 July 2017 we welcomed Gurnek Bains and Jean-Michel Valette 
to the Board as Non-Executive Directors and members of the 
Nomination Committee and Audit Committee respectively. Gurnek’s 
expertise is in the areas of culture change, executive coaching, 
board and strategic talent development while Jean-Michel brings 
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
As reported in the Chief Executive Officer’s review, Intertek has 
delivered good results as we have continued to pursue our 
strategy focused on Total Quality Assurance. In line with our 
progressive dividend policy of sustainably growing the dividend 
each year whilst maintaining minimum dividend cover of 2.5 times 
earnings, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 47 .8p 
bringing the total for the year to 71.3p, up 14.3% and increasing 
the dividend payout ratio to circa 50% in 2018.
The Company remains focused on strong free cash flow 
generation with the result that net debt at the year end of 
£544.1m was 26.8% lower than at the end of 2016. With the 
aim of increasing shareholder value, as well as organic growth, 
we continue to pursue a disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Our strong financial position means we have the flexibility to 
consider strategic acquisition opportunities in new niche and 
emerging areas as well as pursuing acquisitions in the core 
businesses whilst investing in laboratories and equipment to 
support future growth.
T o underpin the successful delivery of long-term sustainable 
growth and shareholder value, your Board is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance. The Board is responsible for 
ensuring the appropriateness and effectiveness of the Group’s 
management and control framework in order to support the delivery 
The Board is committed to the successful

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION
CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION to the Board experience in branded consumer goods, US corporate 
governance, strategic planning and finance. Graham Allan joined the 
Board on 1 October 2017 as our new Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director and as a member of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees. His background in Asia and consumer 
goods, and particularly food and beverages will prove invaluable.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In the context of the Board changes during the year and in 
accordance with the requirements of the Code, we undertook an 
internally facilitated assessment. I am pleased to report that the 
evaluation concluded that each Director is making significant 
contributions to debate and discussion and that the Board and its 
Committees continue to operate effectively. Further details on the 
outcome of the evaluation and its process can be found on pages 
71 and 72.
CULTURE
Corporate culture is continually moving up the agendas of investors, 
our clients and other stakeholders. As such, we believe that the 
Board should give sufficient time not only to discussing 
performance and results, but also to understanding the culture and 
values that underpin a collaborative culture. We are focused on 
ensuring that our strategy and culture provides our people with the 
right platform to grow and develop their careers, but also allows 
them to be involved in activities which are socially responsible and 
enables them to engage with the communities in which they live 
and work. 
During the year, the CEO and his Executive Management T eam 
spent considerable time and energy on embedding Intertek’s values 
within the organisation, and reinforcing the levels of communication 
and behaviour that are expected of everyone. As an example, the 
values supporting the Group and the new brand identity exercise, 
which was rolled out during the year, were developed using the 
input from the business and, in conjunction with the 5x5 strategy 
for growth, have provided the platform to energise our people to 
enable us to get closer to our customers. The Board will continue to 
focus on our culture and promoting good governance to support 
openness and accountability throughout the business.
More detail can be found in the Strategic report on pages 2 and 3.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Our engagement with shareholders is outlined on pages 97 and 
98 and also in the Remuneration report in the letter from the 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee on page 81. I am 
interested in hearing the views of our shareholders. Your 
feedback helps us to ensure that the Board takes these into 
account when considering the strategic direction of the Group.
Finally, I would like to thank the Board, our Executive 
Management and all our employees for their endeavours and 
commitment during 2017 .
