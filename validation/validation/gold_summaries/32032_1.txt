 Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

Introduction
Still at the beginning of our journey… 
after 25 years 
I am pleased to report another successful 
year, with revenue for the 12 months 
ended 31 May 2017 up 17.4% to £50.5m 
(2016: £43.0m). We are over half way 
towards our medium term goal of growing 
revenues to £100m and we continue to 
focus on delivering great outcomes for our 
clients, with one of our key aims being to 
reduce their total expense ratios (“TERs”) 
while maintaining our target profit margin. 
Sustained demand for advice, driven by our 
clients’ desire for a better understanding of 
their financial position, and the continued 
development of our investment and asset 
management proposition have driven 
strong new business flows, which together 
with acquisitions completed in the 
current and prior financial year increased 
total client assets under management, 
administration and advice by 17.5% to 
£7.77bn (2016: £6.61bn) at the year end. 
Organic growth was supplemented by 
£1.2m of revenues generated by the MC 
Trustees pension administration business 
acquired in September 2016, plus full-year 
revenues of £7.1m (2016: £5.2m) from the 
five businesses acquired in the prior year . 
EBITDA
5
 was up 18.0% to £10.5m  
(2016: £8.9m), maintaining EBITDA  
margin at 20.8% (2016: 20.7%) despite 
further investment in the infrastructure 
of our business and an expected fall in 
banking revenues. 
Adjusted EPS
6
 increased 11.4% to 34.1p 
(2016: 30.6p), while basic EPS was up 
18.7% to 24.8p (2016: 20.9p), with growth in 
operating profits stated after £0.4m (2016: 
£0.3m) of acquisition-related costs and 
£0.3m (2016: £0.5m) of notional finance 
charges on the unwinding of discounts on 
long-term provisions. The effective rate of 
taxation was 16.9% (2016: 16.6%) due to 
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities on 
acquired intangibles following further cuts 
in the substantively enacted rate of UK 
corporation tax. 
Our success is based upon the delivery 
of quality advice, services and products, 
growing our clients’ assets and enhancing 
their financial outcomes. The foundation 
of this success is the development of our 
people and I am delighted we have created 
a business our clients are proud to be 
a part of, our people feel proud to work 
for and which is one that recognises and 
rewards talent and hard work. 
Our recent achievements have been 
recognised with a number of industry 
awards for individual and corporate 
achievements nationally and locally, 
including Best Corporate Pensions 
Advice Firm at the Retirement Planner 
Awards 2017, as well as being highly 
commended with a 5-star SSAS rating at 
the Moneyfacts Awards 2017. 
In addition to being an Investors in People 
organisation, the Group continues to be 
recognised for creating opportunities 
for young people and recently won 
Apprenticeship Employer of the Year at 
the 2017 Leicester Apprenticeship Hub 
Graduation Ceremony. 
Industry overview
Mattioli Woods operates within the UK’s 
financial services industry, which is 
subject to the effects of volatile markets 
and economic conditions. In recent years 
we have seen a period of unprecedented 
change in legislation and regulation. 
As a result of changing customer needs 
the market for our services continues to 
grow, with there now estimated to be a 
record five million Britons paying higher

Royal seal of approval as Ian and Bob receive MBEs from Prince of Wales
Co-founders Ian Mattioli and Bob 
Woods were presented with MBEs 
by Prince Charles in an investiture 
ceremony at Buckingham Palace 
in May 2017.
They were named as recipients of the 
awards in the New Year’s Honours List in 
recognition of their services to business 
and the community.
Both were given their insignia by His 
Royal Highness in front of their proud 
families in the palace’s elegant ballroom. 
“It was so nice to be there alongside so 
many people who were being recognised 
for their selfless actions, ordinary people 
who give freely of their time and efforts 
yet seek no reward.”
Former chairman Bob Woods, now 
Senior Adviser to the company, said: 
“To be there, surrounded by so much 
history, and to think we were a small 
part of it was an incredible feeling and 
something I’ll always cherish.”
“It was an amazing occasion, 
a real mixture of excitement 
and adrenaline, but at 
the same time incredibly 
humbling”

We continue to be proactive in relation to 
the opportunities this creates, with our 
specialists dedicated to keeping up with 
the pace of change. Our entrepreneurial 
model allows us to adapt and advise our 
clients accordingly. 
Our markets are highly fragmented and 
serviced by a wide range of suppliers 
offering diverse services to both individual 
and corporate clients. These markets 
remain highly competitive, with recent 
regulatory changes, including the abolition 
of provider commissions on corporate 
pensions in April 2016 and increased 
capital requirements for SIPP operators 
from 1 September 2016, driving further 
consolidation across the industry. 
The Financial Advice Market Review 
(“FAMR”) published by the FCA and  
HM Treasury in March 2016 made a series 
of recommendations designed to tackle 
barriers to consumers engaging with 
financial advice and help the industry 
develop more cost-effective ways of 
delivering advice, particularly through the 
use of technology, while the FCA’s recent 
review of the asset management market 
highlighted its concerns over pricing. 
We continue to invest in the development 
of our IT platform and anticipate that the 
entry of new competitors with innovative 
technology (such as ‘robo-advice’) may 
drive some margin compression in the 
wider market. I expect this, coupled with 
regulatory and market concerns around 
the cost of financial services, to further 
validate our vertically-integrated model, 
where seeking operational efficiencies in 
administration and reducing investment 
management and administration costs 
are key elements of our drive to reduce 
our clients’ TERs, while maintaining 
fair and sustainable profit margins for 
our shareholders. 
Our services
Our core pension and wealth management 
offering serves the higher end of the 
market, including controlling directors and 
owner-managed businesses, professionals, 
executives and retirees. Our broad range 
of employee benefit services is targeted 
towards medium-sized and larger 
corporates. 
In recent years, the Group has developed a 
broader wealth management proposition, 
grown from its strong pensions advisory 
and administration expertise, with the 
Group’s income now derived from four  
key service lines: 
 » Investment and asset management; 
 » Pension consultancy and 
administration; 
 » Employee benefits; and 
 » Property management. 
We aim to operate a seamless structure, 
allowing us to cover all aspects of wealth 
management and employee benefits, 
without confusing strategy for individual 
service lines, such as our advice-led SSAS 
and SIPP proposition. 
Medium-term goals
Our vision is to create a long-term 
sustainable business, built on integrity 
and trust, and delivered with passion. 
Throughout our first 25 years we have 
stayed true to our core values, putting 
our clients at the heart of everything we 
do and doing what is right to build long-
term shareholder value. To assist in the 
achievement of our long-term objectives, 
in early 2014 we announced the following 
medium-term goals:
 » Revenue  £100m
 » Assets under management,  
administration and advice £15bn
 » EBITDA margin 20% 
We are making strong progress towards 
these goals and remain a business built 
on the integrity and expertise of our people. 
We will continue to focus on delivering 
great outcomes for our clients, with 
one of our key aims being to grow and 
preserve their investment assets. 
SET
GO
The Board and Senior Executives have 
long debated the structure of our rapidly 
growing group. When we announced our 
medium-term goals to the market we had 
annual revenues of £23m and assets under 
management, administration and advice 
of £3.6bn.
The business has changed from a young 
entrepreneurial business into what I now 
call ‘a small, friendly corporate’. Last year, 
my longstanding business partner Bob 
Woods stepped down after ten years in 
the role of Executive Chairman to focus 
on his client portfolio, new business 
development and acting as an ambassador 
for Mattioli Woods. Bob and I have now 
worked closely together for over 30 years. 
With Joanne Lake stepping into the 
Non-Executive Chairman role, it was a 
timely opportunity to look closely at the 
structure of the Group. We added to the 
executive team with the appointments of 
Sara Andrews as Chief Business Officer 
and Simon Gibson as Chief Investment 
Officer and created SET
GO
, our Senior 
Executive Team, with the ‘go’ highlighting 
that we are set, ready and moving 
forward. The introduction of SET
GO
 gives 
all our people – clients, shareholders, 
employees and suppliers – a very clear 
operational structure that is enhancing 
our management of the Company and 
will enable it to further grow and develop. 
The new SET
GO
 structure combined with 
a smaller Board is logical, practical and 
in all our people’s best interests.
Mark Smith and Alan Fergusson stepped 
down from the Board in August 2017, 
continuing in their full-time executive 
roles as key members of the SET
GO 
team. Mark’s and Alan’s experience adds 
great value to the Group and both have 
given their support to these changes, 
for which I am truly grateful – it shows 
their long-term commitment to realising 
our ambitions.

Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
“Demand has surpassed our expectations and we 
have built a well-diversified portfolio of structured 
products within the fund”
Mark Fuller
Head of Structured Products
Mattioli Woods has seen huge 
demand for its industry-leading 
structured products fund, which 
has attracted over £100m of 
investment in its first six months.
The unique venture delivers substantial 
cost-savings and better returns for 
clients. It was created in association with 
Commerzbank AG, a leading commercial 
bank with branches and offices in more 
than 50 countries.
The fund – recognised by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) – offers greater 
security, an improved investment 
process, higher potential returns and 
instant diversification of products.
It builds on the company’s long-standing 
track record of managing more than 
£250m in structured investments, which 
have provided average returns of more 
than 6% per annum.
Mark Fuller, explains the concept 
and why it has been such a 
runaway success.
Prior to the fund’s launch, what 
did the company offer in terms 
of structured products?
Previously, we offered individual 
structured products with individual 
pay-offs. However many clients held a 
number of these individual structured 
products, in effect giving them a ‘fund’ 
of structured products. The multiple 
structured product holdings of many 
clients gave us the premise for 
launching the fund.
Why did Mattioli Woods decide it 
was time to launch its own fund?
We wanted to evolve our structured 
product offering by building on what 
we already had. SPs have provided 
steady attractive returns since 2005 at 
Mattioli Woods, but all the old structured 
products had a number of drawbacks 
- primarily credit exposure to the bank 
issuing the structured product and the 
administration associated with investing 
in structured products. The fund gives 
all the advantages of structured product 
investing without any credit exposure 
and the administration is now much 
less time consuming.
How long did it take to set up?
Once we agreed on what we were going 
to do, it took around nine months. A big 
proportion of this time (more than three 
months) was taken up obtaining all the 
necessary regulatory approvals.
In what way does it differ from 
others on the market?
Our fund was the first of its type to be 
offered to retail investors. The fund’s 
exposure can be recreated by buying 
individual structured products, but the 
extra features such as the daily liquidity 
and collateralisation cannot. Our clients 
are only exposed to the movement of the 
structured products held by the fund, 
which makes our fund unique.
How would you describe its 
success to date?
Improving the client experience of 
investing in structured products was at 
the core of what we set out to achieve. 
Clients can now buy units in the fund 
as easily as buying shares. Furthermore, 
we publish the price of the units in the 
fund every day and the fund’s holdings 
are available on our dedicated website  
www.structuredproductsfund.com. 
The amount of money we have attracted 
into the fund shows how clients have 
understood and endorsed what we have 
created. For me, the amount raised is 
a secondary consideration. I am solely 
focussed in achieving the target return 
for clients – whether we have £1m in 
the fund or £100m.
The fund was seen as ground-
breaking at the time of launch. 
Do you think it will be emulated 
by other companies?
It has already been emulated by 
other structured product providers. 
A large French bank, Societe Generale, 
is launching its own fund in Q3 2017. 
Who can invest in the Mattioli 
Woods fund – and how much do 
they need to put in?
Any Mattioli Woods client can invest. 
The minimum investment is £3,000. 
This can be as a lump sum or in 
monthly instalments.
What is the minimum 
investment period?
It is intended to be held for the long-
term, and clients should invest with at 
least a two-year investment horizon. 
However, units in the fund can be bought 
and sold every day if clients need to 
access their investment in the fund.
What are the likely returns?
We are targeting cash plus 6%. 
Cash means 3 month Libor – the 
standard cash benchmark. 
However, I view this is a minimum 
return – not a maximum.
Name one of the main advantages 
it has over other funds.
The vast majority of funds rely on assets 
invested in going up to achieve a return. 
Our structured product fund can achieve 
a return if the underlying assets we 
invest in go up, down or stay the same. 
The fund is also collateralised, meaning 
we are not exposed to the insolvency of 
any of the banks we deal with.

The acquisition of MC Trustees during  
the year added £466.5m of client assets, 
with a net inflow of £699.3m during the 
year comprising:
 » An increase of £568.7m in SIPP 
and SSAS funds under trusteeship, 
following a period of strong investment 
returns and net organic growth of 
7.6% in the number of schemes being 
administered at the year end. We 
enjoyed 11.8% net organic growth 
in direct11 schemes, with 1.6% net 
organic growth in the number of 
schemes the Group operates on an 
administration-only basis (excluding 
the acquisition of MC Trustees)
 » A £186.5m increase in other personal 
and pension assets; and
 » A £55.9m fall in the value of assets 
held in the corporate pension schemes 
advised by our employee benefits 
business, following the loss of a large 
client in the North Sea oil and gas 
industry, which has gone through a 
difficult period of cost-cutting and 
redundancies. It should be noted that 
revenues in our employee benefits 
business are not linked to the value 
of client assets in the same way that 
certain of our wealth management 
revenue streams are. 
We have extended our asset management 
business through our purchase of 49% of 
Amati, an award-winning specialist fund 
management business based in Edinburgh, 
focusing on UK small and mid-sized 
companies. Amati is the manager of the 
TB Amati UK Smaller Companies Fund; 
two AIM Venture Capital Trusts (Amati VCT 
plc and Amati VCT 2 plc); and an AIM IHT 
portfolio service. Amati’s total AuM had 
increased from £120m at acquisition to 
over £165m at the year end. We anticipate 
further growth in the value of Amati’s AuM, 
including the boards of the VCTs plans to 
launch a joint fundraising to raise around 
£20m between the two VCTs later this year . 
Mattioli Woods has the option to acquire 
the remaining 51% of Amati in the two 
years commencing 6 February 2019 for 
a mixture of cash and Mattioli Woods’ 
ordinary shares. 
Segmental review
Investment and asset management
Investment and asset management 
revenues generated from advising clients 
on both pension and personal investments 
increased 23.5% to £21.0m (2016: £17.0m), 
representing 41.6% (2016: 39.6%) of 
total Group revenues. Income from both 
initial and ongoing portfolio management 
charges increased to £10.7m (2016: 
£8.8m), as the value of clients’ assets in 
discretionary portfolios increased 29.5% to 
£1.14bn (2016: £0.88bn). The Group’s gross 
discretionary assets under management, 
including Custodian REIT, the FP 
Mattioli Woods Balanced Fund (formerly 
the Thoroughbred OEIC) and the Mattioli 
Woods Structured Products Fund totalled 
£1.63bn (2016: £1.17bn) at the year end. 
The Mattioli Woods Structured Products 
Fund was launched in November 2016 
and has raised over £100m to date, 
generating fund management charges 
of £0.2m during the year . The fund has 
been designed around our core objective 
of delivering sustainable long-term 
returns to clients while lowering their 
costs and offers investors the benefits of 
collateralisation, instant diversification, 
continuous availability and liquidity. 
Adviser charges based on the value  
of assets under advice were £10.1m 
(2016: £8.2m). The growth in funds under 
management and advice continues to 
enhance the quality of earnings through 
an increase in recurring revenues, with 
the proportion of investment and asset 
management revenues which are 
recurring being 81.0% (2016: 81.7%).  
As with other firms, these income  
streams are linked to the value of funds 
under management and advice, and are 
therefore affected by the performance  
of financial markets. 
Pension consultancy  
and administration
Retirement planning is often central to our 
clients’ wealth management strategies. 
We maintain our technical edge through 
our widely acknowledged understanding of 
UK pension legislation, which allows our 
consultancy team to deliver meaningful 
guidance to our clients. Our client 
base primarily comprises owner-
managers, executives and members 
of the professions. Additional fees 
are generated from the provision of 
specialist consultancy services. 
In July 2017, the work and pensions 
secretary announced that individuals 
born between 1970 and 1978 will now 
have to wait an extra year, until they 
are 68, to claim their state pension. 
While continual change (and talk of 
change) to the UK pensions system may 
work against the Government’s aim 
to ensure all individuals save for their 
retirement, I expect it to drive sustained 
demand for advice, benefiting our core 
pensions business. 
Pension consultancy and administration 
revenues were up 13.9% to £18.9m  
(2016: £16.6m), representing 37.4% 
(2016: 38.6%) of Group revenues of which 
92.6% (2016: 82.6%) were recurring, with 
additional one-off revenues earned in the 
prior year following significant changes  
in pension legislation. The growth in 
revenues was driven by the total number 
of SIPP and SSAS schemes administered 
by the Group increasing 27.3% to 10,021 
(2016: 7,872) at the year end, with the 
acquisition of MC Trustees during the  
year adding 1,554 schemes. 
Fees for direct pension consultancy 
and administration, where the Group 
deals directly with the client in all areas 
associated with their pension affairs, 
increased 11.0% to £14.1m (2016: £12.7m), 
with sustained demand for advice as more 
people look to take advantage of pension 
freedoms. The number of direct schemes 
administered by the Group increased 11.8% 
to 5,140 (2016: 4,598), with 764 (2016: 665) 
8 Certain pension scheme assets, including clients’ 
own commercial properties, are only subject to a

new schemes gained in the year (excluding 
acquisitions), representing 16.6% (2016: 
17.3%) of the number of schemes at the 
start of the year . 
Our focus remains on the quality of new 
business, with an average new SIPP value 
of over £0.3m and average new SSAS value 
of over £1.0m. We also maintained strong 
client retention, with an external loss rate
12
 
of 2.1% (2016: 2.4%) and an overall attrition 
rate
13
 of 3.6% (2016: 3.6%). 
Third party administration fees increased 
31.4% to £4.6m (2016: £3.5m), with £1.2m 
of revenues generated by MC Trustees 
during the period. The number of SSAS 
and SIPP schemes the Group operates  
on an administration-only basis increased 
to 4,881 (2016: 3,274) at the year end.  
In recent years, Mattioli Woods has 
been appointed to operate or wind-up 
a number of distressed SIPP portfolios 
following the failure of the previous 
operator . Lost schemes include the 
planned transfer of members of these 
distressed SIPP portfolios to alternative 
arrangements, with the 265 schemes lost 
during the period being more than offset 
by acquisition of MC Trustees’ portfolio  
and organic growth. 
Strong growth in pension fees was offset 
by an anticipated fall of £0.2m in banking 
revenues to £0.2m (2016: £0.4m), following 
the cut in the Bank of England base rate  
to a historic low of 0.25% in August 2016. 
The introduction of increased regulatory 
capital requirements for SIPP operators 
on 1 September 2016 and the accelerating 
pace of consolidation within the SIPP 
market is putting some smaller operators 
under increasing pressure to join forces 
with larger firms. 
Property management
Property management revenues increased 
26.8% to £5.2m (2016: £4.1m) or 10.3% 
of total revenue (2016: 9.5%), of which 
90.4% (2016: 91.6%) represented 
recurring annual management charges. 
Our subsidiary Custodian Capital is the 
external fund manager to Custodian 
REIT plc and also manages properties 
on behalf of pension schemes and private 
clients, managing an overall portfolio of 
property investments with a net asset 
value of £445.0m (2016: £328.1m) at the 
year end. The majority of our property 
management revenues are derived from 
the services provided to Custodian REIT, 
which now has a market capitalisation 
of almost £400m and offers one of the 
highest yields
14
 among its UK property 
investment company peer group, coupled 
with the potential for capital growth from 
a balanced portfolio of real estate assets. 
Custodian Capital manages our “Private 
Investors Club”, which offers alternative 
investment opportunities to suitable 
clients by way of private investor 
syndicates. This continues to be well 
received by clients, with £20.6m (2016: 
£9.9m) invested in seven (2016: eight) 
new syndicates completed during the year . 
As part of our strategy to create a 
single, strong identity across our Group, 
Custodian Capital will be renamed Mattioli 
Woods Capital in the first half of the 2018 
calendar year . 
Employee benefits
At a time when the employee benefits 
market is going through extensive 
transition, we recognise the value that 
having a full employee benefits offering 
adds to the Group, allowing us to realise 
synergies between it and our wealth 
management business, with revenues of 
£0.7m (2016: £0.6m) generated in cross 
referrals between the two divisions during 
the last financial year . 
Employee benefits revenues were up 
1.9% to £5.4m (2016: £5.3m), representing 
10.7% of total revenue (2016: 12.3%). 
I believe this is a major achievement, 
following the rebasing of our employee 
benefits business to create the platform 
to optimise our position in this market. 
The move to a fee-based proposition has 
been well-received by corporate clients, 
with 75.9% (2016: 78.7%) of employee 
benefits revenues recurring, and I expect 
our Executive Financial Counselling, 
Boardroom Pay and Financial Education 
initiatives to continue to gather pace. 
There is rising recognition from 
organisations of the importance 
of investing in employee benefits. 
Employers are increasingly encouraging 
staff wellbeing and retirement savings, 
which we expect to drive a period of 
steady growth in the UK employee benefits 
market, and I am delighted over 100 
new corporate clients were attracted to 
the Group’s range of employee benefits 
services during the year . 
In addition, the employee benefits work 
of our Aberdeen business is stabilising 
following several years of localised 
contraction in the oil and gas industry. 
Our membership of the Worldwide Broker 
Network, on which Alan Fergusson serves 
on the board, is driving an increasing 
number of referrals and we have grown 
our consultancy team to capitalise on 
these new opportunities. 
The FAMR highlighted concerns around 
a developing ‘advice gap’, driven by: 
 » Increasing responsibility on individuals 
to manage their own financial affairs; 
 » The ability of individuals to pay for 
advice; and
 » Advice needs arising from pensions’

We believe the Government’s emphasis 
on workplace advice presents new 
opportunities for us to realise further 
synergies between our employee benefits 
and wealth management businesses. 
Financial performance and  
future developments
Group results
Revenues were up 17.4% to £50.5m  
(2016: £43.0m), with sustained demand for 
the Group’s services. We are particularly 
pleased with the continued development 
of our broader wealth management 
proposition and the integration of recently 
acquired businesses during the year . 
The mix between the Group’s key revenue 
streams changed during the period, 
summarised as follows: 
 » 41.6% investment and asset 
management (2016: 39.6%);
 » 37.4% pension consultancy and 
administration (2016: 38.6%);
 » 10.7% employee benefits  
(2016: 12.3%); and
 » 10.3% property management  
(2016: 9.5%). 
EBITDA increased 18.0% to £10.5m  
(2016: £8.9m), with EBITDA margin of 
20.8% (2016: 20.7%) despite further 
investment in the infrastructure and 
sustainability of our business, a fall in 
banking revenues and costs associated 
with the completion and integration of 
recent acquisitions. 
To facilitate a like-for-like comparison 
with prior years, acquisition costs of  
£0.4m (2016: £0.3m) incurred on 
acquisitions during the year have been 
added back in calculating adjusted 
EBITDA and adjusted profit before tax. 
Adjusted EBITDA

 increased 17.2% to 
£10.9m (2016: £9.3m), while adjusted 
EBITDA margin was 21.6% (2016: 21.6%). 
12 Direct schemes lost to an alternative provider as a 
percentage of average scheme numbers during the 
period.

purchase, external transfer or cancellation as a 
percentage of average scheme numbers during  
the period.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Previously, I set out our aim to reduce 
the TERs incurred by clients and I see 
both a market expectation and possible 
regulatory or legislative pressure to 
reduce product costs, which could bring 
about some continued pressure on sector 
margins. We plan to manage this by 
realising operational efficiencies through 
the development of our IT platform and 
securing further reductions in investment 
management and platform costs. 
Net finance costs
The Group has maintained a positive net 
cash position throughout the year, with net 
finance costs of £0.2m (2016: £0.3m) due 
to the impact of £0.3m (2016: £0.5m) of 
notional finance charges on the unwinding 
of discounts on long-term provisions. 
Taxation
The effective rate of taxation on profit 
on ordinary activities of 16.9% (2016: 
16.6%) was again below the standard 
rate of tax primarily due to the 
recalculation of deferred tax liabilities 
on acquired intangibles following a cut 
in the substantively enacted rate of UK 
corporation tax from 18% to 17%. The net 
deferred taxation liability carried forward 
at 31 May 2017 was £2.8m (2016: £3.0m).
Earnings per share and dividend 
Adjusted EPS
16
 was up 11.4% to 34.1p  
(2016: 30.6p) with strong revenue growth 
and an increase in operating profits. 
Basic EPS increased 18.7% to 24.8p  
(2016: 20.9p), with a fall in the value of 
add backs to adjusted EPS as a result 
of a fall in notional finance charges on 
the unwinding of discounts on long-term 
provisions. Diluted EPS increased 18.2% 
to 24.7p (2016: 20.9p), with the exercise 
of 226,841 options issued under the 
Company’s share option plans during the 
year and the issue of 256,061 new shares 
as consideration for acquisitions. 
Dividends
The Board is pleased to recommend the 
payment of an increased final dividend of 
9.4p per share (2016: 8.65p). This makes 
a proposed total dividend for the year of 
14.1p (2016: 12.5p), a year-on-year increase 
of 12.8% (2016: 19.0%), demonstrating 
our desire to deliver value to shareholders 
and confidence in the outlook for our 
business. The Board remains committed 
to growing the dividend, while maintaining 
an appropriate level of dividend cover . If 
approved, the final dividend will be paid 
on 27 October 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 22 
September 2017. 
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations fell to 
£10.5m or 100% of EBITDA (2016: £11.8m 
or 133%). A £1.8m increase in cash flows 
from operating activities before changes in 
working capital and provisions to £12.3m 
(2016: £10.5m) was offset by a £1.8m 
increase in the Group’s working capital 
requirement (2016: decrease of £1.3m) 
following a £2.0m (2016: £0.5m) increase 
in trade and other receivables and a 
£1.5m decrease (2016: £0.2m increase) 
in provisions after the settlement of 
contingent deferred consideration on 
acquisitions and cash settled share-
based payment awards during the year . 
The impact of the increase in receivables 
and decrease in provisions was partially 
offset by a £1.7m (2016: £1.6m) increase 
in trade and other payables, which was 
primarily due to:
 » A £1.3m increase in accrued staff 
bonuses at the year end, following 
another successful year and an 
increase in headcount across the 
Group; and 
 » A £0.6m increase in trade payables 
at the year end, with a £0.9m stage 
payment on the New Walk office 
development outstanding at the 
year end. 
The increase in trade and other receivables 
was due to:
 » A £0.9m increase in accrued income 
and prepayments as a result of the 
increase in assets under management 
and advice during the year;
 » A £0.7m increase in other receivables 
following an increase in property 
insurance premiums incurred by the 
Group to be recharged to clients at the 
year end; and
 » A £0.4m increase in trade 
receivables following strong growth 
in direct pension consultancy and 
administration fees. 
Net cash at 31 May 2017 was £23.0m 
(2016: £29.8m), with £2.8m of initial 
cash consideration paid and £0.2m 
cash acquired on the two transactions 
completed during the year, plus £2.3m 
(2016: £1.1m) of contingent deferred 
consideration paid in cash on historic 
acquisitions. 
Outstanding trade receivables fell to 
40 days’ sales (2016: 46 days), with an 
increase in investment and asset 
management revenues and a continued 
focus on credit control, while trade 
payables remained at 52 days’ 
purchases (2016: 52 days). 
Capital expenditure in the year was £9.1m 
(2016: £1.7m), with the most significant 
costs being £7.4m incurred on the 
development of the Group’s new offices 
in Leicester, £1.1m investment in new 
computer hardware, software and office 
equipment and £0.5m on the purchase of 
new company cars following continued 
expansion of the consultancy team. 
The continued development of the Group’s 
technology infrastructure is a key part of 
our strategy and although taking longer 
than we initially anticipated, investment in 
our bespoke pension administration and 
wealth management platform continues in 
line with expected spend. We are reviewing 
the possibility of moving to a hosted IT 
infrastructure, which may offer improved 
data security, business continuity and 
scalability for future growth. 
Bank facilities
The Group does not have an overdraft  
facility due to the headroom the 
Group’s current cash balances provide 
on its working capital requirements. 
Management will continue to review the 
level of bank facilities the Group may 
require going forward. 
Capital structure
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:
 2017 2016
 £000 £000
Net cash (22,979) (29,809)
Shareholders’ equity 72,595 65,581
Capital employed 49,616 35,772
The Group continues to maintain a net cash 
position, with net cash balances falling 
to £23.0m (2016: £29.8m) due to capital 
expenditure during the year, coupled with 
the initial cash outflows on the acquisition 
of MC Trustees and the Group’s investment 
in Amati. 
Regulatory capital
The Board considers it prudent for the 
Group to target headroom of circa 25% over 
the FCA regulatory capital requirement. 
The Group’s regulatory capital requirement 
has increased in recent years, and in 
addition its capital is eroded when it makes 
acquisitions due to the requirement for 
intangible assets arising on acquisition to 
be deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 
The Group continues to enjoy significant 
headroom on its increased regulatory 
capital requirement following the 
acquisition of MC Trustees and its

impairment of acquired intangibles, and notional 
finance income and charges. Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

investment in Amati during the 
year, allowing us to pursue further 
acquisition opportunities. 
Acquisitions
We have invested £46m since our 
admission to AIM in 2005 in bringing 
20 businesses or client portfolios into 
the Group, developing considerable 
expertise and a strong track record in the 
execution and its subsequent integration 
of such transactions. 
In September 2016, we were pleased to 
acquire MC Trustees, bringing additional 
scale and expertise to our pension 
administration business. MC Trustees 
is a great fit culturally and strategically, 
serving a similar client base to the Group’s 
existing business, while complementing our 
existing operations. 
The Group’s strategic investment in Amati 
announced in February 2017 brings a 
new dimension to our asset management 
business, which we expect to deliver 
significant synergies for each business. 
The five businesses acquired during the 
previous financial year have integrated well 
and all have contributed positively to the 
Group’s trading results since acquisition, 
increasing earnings and enhancing value. 
With increasing complexity and continuing 
consolidation across the key markets in 
which we operate, we expect there will 
be further opportunities to accelerate our 
strong organic growth by acquisition. 
Relationships
The Group’s performance and value to 
our shareholders are influenced by other 
stakeholders, principally our clients, 
suppliers, employees, the Government 
and our strategic partners. Our approach 
to all these parties is founded on the 
principle of open and honest dialogue, 
based on a mutual understanding of 
needs and objectives. 
Relationships with our clients are managed 
on an individual basis through our client 
relationship managers and consultants. 
Employees have performance development 
reviews and employee forums also provide 
a communication route between employees 
and management including SET
GO
. 
Mattioli Woods also participates in 
trade associations and industry groups, 
which give us access to client and 
supplier groups and decision-makers 
in Government and other regulatory 
bodies. Mattioli Woods is a member of 
the Association of Member-directed 
Pension Schemes and the Quoted 
Companies Alliance. 
Resources
The Group aims to safeguard the assets 
that give it competitive advantage, including 
its reputation for quality and proactive 
advice, its technical competency and 
its people. 
Our core values provide a framework 
for integrity, leading to responsible and 
ethical business practices. Structures for 
accountability from our administration 
and consultancy teams through to SET
GO
 
and the Group’s Board are clearly defined. 
The proper operation of the supporting 
processes and controls are regularly 
reviewed by the Audit, Risk and Compliance 
Committee and take into account ethical 
considerations, including procedures for 
‘whistle-blowing’. 
Our people
advantage of new business opportunities, 
with the number of consultants having 
increased to 115 (2016: 104) at the year end. 
With continued growth in our investment 
and asset management business, and 
to support our growth ambitions, we 
strengthened our SET
GO
 team through 
the appointments of Simon Gibson as 
the Group’s Chief Investment Officer 
and Sara Andrews as Chief Business 
Officer . Simon is a well-respected fund 
manager with over 30 years’ investing 
experience, while Sara brings more 
than 25 years’ experience of developing 
people and managing change within fast-
growing businesses. 
We also welcomed 26 employees to 
the Group as part of the MC Trustees 
acquisition. As an Investors in People 
company we are committed to 
developing our people and building the 
capacity to deliver sustainable growth. 
Recent expansion has seen us move into 
larger premises in London and Glasgow, 
and open a new office in Manchester . 
We enjoy a strong team spirit and facilitate 
employee equity ownership through the 
Mattioli Woods plc Share Incentive Plan 
(“the Plan”) and other share schemes. 
At the year end the proportion of eligible 
staff invested via the Plan remained high 
at 58% (2016: 61%) and we will continue to 
encourage broader participation in the Plan. 
Forward-looking statements
The strategic report is prepared for the 
members of Mattioli Woods and should not 
be relied upon by any other party for any 
other purpose. Where the report contains 
forward-looking statements these are 
made by the directors in good faith based 
on the information available to them at 
the time of their approval of this report. 
Consequently, such statements should be 
treated with caution due to the inherent 
uncertainties, including both economic and 
business risks underlying such forward-
looking statements and information. 
The Group undertakes no obligation to 
update these forward-looking statements. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks which 
could hinder the implementation of our 
strategy and have a material impact on 
our long-term performance. These arise 
from internal or external events, acts or 
omissions which could pose a threat to  
the Group. 
We are proud of our consistently high client 
retention rate, but continue seeking ways 
to strengthen this. We believe the most 
significant risk we face is potential damage 
Our friend and colleague,
Ketan Radia
In September 2016, Mattioli Woods 
lost one of its very best. Our friend 
and colleague, Ketan Radia, passed 
away shortly after playing football 
with his beloved two boys and family. 
Ketan was a fantastic employee and 
ambassador for all things Mattioli 
Woods. Ketan’s friends within the 
Group continue to help and provide 
support to his wife Reena and the 
boys. Ketan is so sadly missed.
As we continue to grow, our previous 
“Small to Big” employee engagement 
theme has evolved into our new “Big to 
Better” initiative, which will enable us to 
retain our core principles as a business 
built on the integrity, expertise and passion 
of our people. Our total headcount at 
31 May 2017 had increased to 568 (2016: 
504) and we continue to invest in our 
graduate recruitment programme, with 25 
(2016: 25) new graduates and 16 (2016: 15) 
apprentices joining the Group during the 
year . We are also developing programmes 
for ‘life served’ people seeking exciting 
opportunities for a change in career or a 
return to work. We continue to expand our 
consultancy and technical teams to take  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

Chief Executive’s Officers review continued
to our reputation as a result of poor client 
service and we are determined not to let 
standards slip. We address this through 
ongoing quality control procedures and the 
provision of regular training for all our staff. 
Pension regulations will continue to be 
reviewed. Future changes may not produce 
an environment that is advantageous to 
the Group and any changes in regulation 
may be retrospective. To address this risk, 
we are committed to ensuring that our 
views are expressed during consultation 
exercises and that we respond positively 
and rapidly to new regulations. 
We also recognise that a significant 
skills shortage would represent a risk to 
growth. We are mitigating this risk through 
investment in our graduate, apprentice 
and life served recruitment programmes 
and by providing incentives to motivate and 
retain our existing employees. Throughout 
the Group, we have introduced Financial 
Assess, a web-based training programme 
provided through the Chartered Insurance 
Institute, written specifically from a 
financial services perspective. This training 
helps maintain staff competence and 
compliance within our organisation 
and brings a better understanding to 
all employees of the markets in which 
we operate. 
One source of revenue is based on the 
value of cash balances held in clients’ 
schemes. These balances are not 
included in the Consolidated or Company 
statements of financial position. In recent 
years, lower banking margins due to a 
continued low interest rate environment 
have resulted in a decline in these 
revenues. Following the Bank of England’s 
decision to cut the base rate to a historic 
low of 0.25% in August 2016 we have 
reviewed how we might enhance our client 
banking model and plan to launch a new 
pooled banking solution for our clients’ 
pension scheme accounts later this year . 
The Group has an indirect exposure to 
security price risk on investments held 
by clients, with discretionary portfolio 
management fees, fund management 
fees, adviser charges (including legacy 
investment commissions) and property 
management fees being based on the 
value of clients’ assets under management, 
administration or advice. Periods of 
volatility in a particular asset class may see 
changes in how our investment revenues 
are derived. However, a great strength 
of our business is that we can continue 
to derive income from investments in all 
asset classes, while ensuring our clients’ 
investment strategies are appropriately 
aligned to the prevailing market conditions 
and suitable for their financial needs. 
The table on pages 24 to 27 outlines the 
current risk factors for the business 
identified by the Group. The risk factors 
mentioned do not purport to be exhaustive 
as there may be additional risks that 
materialise over time that the Group 
has not yet identified or deemed to have 
a potentially material adverse effect on 
the business.
Corporate social responsibility
We believe that running a profitable 
and growing business, which creates 
jobs and contributes to the economic 
success of the areas in which it operates, 
is a good platform for good corporate 
social responsibility. 
Mattioli Woods has a long-standing 
commitment to ensure our staff can 
engage with their local communities, 
playing a valuable role by forming 
innovative partnerships with other 
organisations and charities. This social 
awareness is present throughout the 
business, from our employees to our 
clients, our professional connections 
and the suppliers we use.
We have a high level of engagement 
within our local communities. Each year, 
we sponsor both business, sports and 
community awards. Our business has 
benefited greatly from winning numerous 
awards and we feel its right to help other 
businesses reap the rewards of such 
accolades. In addition, we sponsor a variety 
of local clubs, business and sports related 
events across the country. We believe 
this brings many benefits to the local 
community and beyond. 
The Group is pleased to continue 
sponsoring the Rothley 10k, one of the 
most celebrated charity road running races 
in Leicestershire, which attracted almost 
800 runners in 2017, a new record for the 
race, which again raised over £20,000 of 
essential funds for a variety of local causes, 
including LOROS, Rainbows, County Air 
Ambulance Service, Age UK, Eye Camps 
and RNLI. 
In 2015 we chose our first national charity, 
Breast Cancer Now, the UK’s largest 
breast cancer charity dedicated to funding 
research into this devastating disease. 
By tackling the disease in the labs, on the 
political agenda, through public health 
information and with the health service, it 
believes it can transform the outlook for 
everyone affected by breast cancer . To date, 
the Group has raised over £127,000 for 
the charity. 
Employees across the country have been 
involved in a number of activities to raise 
essential funding for this great cause, 
including a group wide cycling challenge, 
Tough Mudder in the Midlands, the National 
Three Peaks Challenge, the London and 
Edinburgh marathons, Glack Attack in 
Aberdeen and numerous cake sales 
and challenges. 
We also continue to sponsor wheelchair 
racer Sammi Kinghorn, who won two 
gold medals at the world para athletics 
championships in London in 2017 and 
now has her sights set on the 2018 
Commonwealth Games.
In addition, we support many other smaller 
charities such as Newmarket’s Open 
Door initiative, which provides vulnerable 
people with supported housing and training 
opportunities; Rainbow House in Preston, 
a comprehensive programme for children, 
young people and adults with neurological 
conditions and Project Luangwa, an 
international charity supported by our 
Solihull team that provides education in 
Zambia through the construction of schools, 
sponsoring of students and provision of 
educational materials.
The Group continues to create opportunities 
for young people through both its Financial 
Services Development scheme and 
apprenticeship recruitment, recently 
winning Apprenticeship Employer of the 
Year at the 2017 Leicester Apprenticeship 
Hub Graduation Ceremony. This year, 
we are looking to recruit 24 graduates 
and increase our apprentice intake 
to 25. We have also given 21 students 
the opportunity to work with us to gain 
valuable work experience during the year . 
Finally, as our Chairman has stated, Bob 
and I were honoured in the Queen’s New 
Year’s Honours List and received MBEs 
for business and community services in 
Leicester – an honour greatly appreciated 
by us both.

Mattioli Woods brings 
new look to heart of 
Leicester city centre
 
Leicester’s city landscape continues 
to transform as work forges ahead 
on the new home for Mattioli 
Woods’ Leicester team.
 
Months of intensive construction work 
have completely reshaped the New Walk 
area as the company’s new offices edge 
nearer completion.
 
The purpose-built structure will provide 
50,000 sq ft of space and house more than 
400 staff when they switch from Enderby 
next year .
 
The site was formerly the headquarters of 
Leicester City Council, whose offices were 
demolished in February 2015 after being 
declared unsafe.
 
Mattioli Woods’ staff have been taken on 
a series of monthly visits to see first-hand 
how the building project is developing.
 
Other improvements in the area include 
new homes, retail outlets and a public 
area designed to complement tree-lined 
New Walk.
