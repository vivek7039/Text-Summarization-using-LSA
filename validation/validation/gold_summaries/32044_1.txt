OUR PERFORMANCE
Group revenue 
For the financial year ended 31 May 2017 , the Group increased 
reported revenue by 17 per cent to £244.5m (2016: £209.1m). 
Excluding Domain Services business that was exited during 
the year, the growth was £37 .7m or 18 per cent. 
The table below shows the proportions of growth that were 
organic (net sales growth in businesses that were owned for 
equivalent periods in the current and prior year), acquisitions 
growth (includes the full year impact of prior year acquisitions), 
and growth resulting from the impact of FX rates. Growth from 
changes in FX rates is calculated by restating the prior year 
revenue figures at current year rates.

Note: the Group’s current information systems do not report the impact of foreign 
exchange movements as a matter of course. The figures above are therefore 
calculated at year end using assumed weighted average exchange rates for 
each relevant currency for each year in question. This is being addressed in the 
Group’s new consolidation system which is being implemented in the first quarter 
of the new financial year.
The FX growth above is driven by increases in the weighted 
average exchange rates of both the US$ and €uro against 
£GBP, both of which strengthened by around 15 per cent.
The geographical breakdown of revenue by the location of the 
delivering business for the current and past year is as follows 
(Domain excluded):

Total revenue 241.9 100 204.2 100
Note: some businesses sell a modest amount of services in other countries and 
report that revenue as being within their own geography.
The amount of Group revenue earned outside the UK 
increased by £35.0m and reflects the impact of the Fox-
IT acquisition in the Netherlands half way through the last 
financial year and also strong growth in our US Assurance 
business. Both of these factors occurred within the Assurance 
division where the share of Group revenue has now risen to 
85 per cent (2016: 83 per cent).
Underlying organic revenue growth in the first half of the 
financial year was 19 per cent but in the second half fell by 
5 per cent compared to the prior year periods. The second half 
of the current year actually saw revenue fall compared to the 
first half,  contrary to the historical trends the business has 
delivered. 
Weakness in the second half compared to the prior year and 
the first half of the current year was particularly focused in 
MSS third party product sales which were £6.5m down in the 
second half compared to the first half.

Fox High Assurance product sales were also down £1.2m in 
the second half. Between them these reductions accounted for 
85 per cent of the fall in sales between the first and second 
halves.
A more detailed breakdown of the revenue performance of 
the Group in each of the operating segments is shown earlier 
in this announcement in the Assurance and Escrow divisional 
reports.
The Group is currently reviewing the basis on which revenue 
analysis is further reported. This review will include concepts 
such as recurring revenues, contracted revenues and repeat 
business. The Group may need to implement systems changes 
to accurately capture this analysis across all business units. 
Some further analysis is set out in the divisional reviews.
The Group continued to have minimal reliance on any one 
customer or sector. Within Assurance the largest customer 
represents approximately 4 per cent of Assurance revenue. 
The largest customer in Escrow is just over 1 per cent of total 
Escrow revenue. 
Group profitability and margins
The Board and Executive management use a number of 
non-GAAP measures in their day-to-day management of 
the business. The Group’s primary financial profitability 
measure will be Adjusted EBIT. Last year the Group used 
Adjusted EBITDA for this purpose. It is management’s view 
that Adjusted EBIT is more closely aligned to the underlying 
performance of the business. The majority of our peers and 
stakeholders use this metric, and hence it is therefore a more 
appropriate KPI for use in the business and in our external 
communications.
The table below sets out the reconciliation between reported 
statutory measures and the non-GAAP measures of Adjusted 
EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA.

OUR PERFORMANCE
During the year, despite delivering growth in most of our 
business units, each business unit and the Group as a whole 
have seen a contraction in our margins. The main cause relates 
to cost increasing both before and at a faster rate than the 
growth in our revenues in each business unit.
Margins contracted due to increases in both direct and indirect 
costs. Salary related costs represent approximately 70 per cent 
of the Group’s cost base. Cost increases were largely driven 
by a significant increase in headcount (16 per cent) combined 
with average salary increases of 6-7 per cent to give total 
salary-based cost increases of approximately 23 per cent, or 
around 16 per cent of sales. 
This compares with total organic and acquisition-based 
revenue growth of 15 per cent and led to a consequent 
reduction in utilisation and realisation from our professional 
service delivery staff. 
We also made investments in new sales structures that have 
not yet born fruit in proportionately increased revenues.
Other indirect cost increases reflect £3.4m of additional 
depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible assets 
linked to a number of systems having entered service, and 
hence these have started amortising. In addition, there was 
a £1.3m acquisition impact on these costs. Premises costs 
increased by £1.4m, partly to accommodate extra staff and 
also in upgrading facilities. Marketing spend rose £1.3m as the 
Group sought to raise its profile in a number of areas. 
As a result, Adjusted EBIT in the year fell from £39.7m to 
£27 .5m despite the benefit of a positive foreign exchange 
impact of £0.6m. At the same time, our Adjusted EBIT margin 
fell from 19.4 per cent to1 1.4 per cent. The following shows the 
key drivers for the reduction in year-on-year profitability.
The Group’s overall EBIT result included £0.2m of losses from 
the now closed Domain Services operating segment (2016: 
operating losses of £1.4m). The current year charge was then 
offset by a £1.2m profit on disposal of Open Registry (also 
treated as an adjusting item).
The Group’s reported pre-tax loss was £55.3m (2016:  
£9.4m profit).

How we are  
part of your daily life
ASSURANCE — SAFEGUARDING HEALTHCARE
One of the biggest ransomware attacks in recent history started somewhere in 
Europe on the morning of Friday 12 May 2017 .
Unnoticed for several hours, it circulated itself across the globe, infecting 
computers by exploiting a weakness in Windows operating systems that allows 
malicious code to be spread through file-sharing structures without a user’s 
consent.
In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) was the most high-profile victim. 
Nearly one-third (30 per cent) of all NHS Trusts were affected, with staff being 
forced to turn patients away and cancel appointments.
Victims in other countries include US delivery service FedEx, French car maker 
Renault and Russia’s Interior Ministry.
The malware, called WannaDecrypter, WannaCry or WCry, spread easily due to 
its ability to self-propagate; an instruction in the malicious code told it to jump 
to other vulnerable machines if it cannot connect to a specified address. This is 
reminiscent of the worm outbreaks of the early 2000s.
How our business model enables this
In these crisis situations, NCC Group’s 24/7 Security Operations Centres and 
managed services capability demonstrate their worth. Working around the clock, 
the team consistently delivers value and reassurance to customers across 
the globe, taking proactive steps to protect our customers and enhance our 
monitoring as new information and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) become 
available.
Over the course of the WannaCry attack, our Security Operations Centres carried 
out the following activities:
 z Provided expert analysis of the threat and offered pragmatic advice to all our 
SOC customers
 z Developed and then enhanced advanced SIEM correlation logic to monitor 
for attacks on customer networks, using IoC information provided from the 
Threat Intelligence (TI) research by NCC Group analysts
 z Used NCC Group’s threat sensors to proactively monitor for IoCs
 z Ensured commercial Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS) signature sets were 
up-to-date and monitored for the latest threats
 z Delivered 24/7 security monitoring, proactively watching for attacks and 
infection
 z Updated our SOC customers on a regular basis, including direct telephone 
calls to ensure that they were aware of the attack and to give them 
reassurance and assurance
How we will leverage this moving forward
As large-scale cyber attacks continue to occur on an ever-more frequent basis, 
it is important that your organisation is protected by utilising NCC Group’s 
24/7 Security Operations Centres and range of protective monitoring managed 
services. 
As a result of these proactive steps and measures, NCC Group’s SOC received 
the following feedback and praise:
“We have indeed received a note from the NCC Group SOC as 
part of the Network Threat Monitoring service, outlining the 
details of the attack and what to do to prevent damage – greatly 
appreciated. As always, we value the services that NCC Group 
brings to the table and are confident that our layered defense 
would offer the necessary resilience in this situation.”

OUR PERFORMANCE
ASSURANCE DIVISION – BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Assurance revenue
Assurance now accounts for 85 per cent of Group revenue 
and the impact of foreign exchange rates contributed £8.0m 
to the growth in the division. In addition, Assurance benefited 
from the full year effect of the prior year acquisition of Fox-IT 
(impact in 2017: £14.0m) and acquisitions in the year just 
completed (PSC £5.9m and VSR £1.1m). Net organic growth 
was £6.8m which represented year-on-year growth of 4.0 per 
cent with the balance due to changes in foreign exchange 
rates (£8.0m impact). The table below shows the revenue 
split between Security Consulting and a combined Web 
Performance and Software Testing.

Security Consulting 178.1 138.9 28
Web Performance and 
Software Testing 26.6 30.0 (1 1)
Total 204.7 168.9 21
Revenues in our Web Performance and Software Testing 
businesses fell by £0.5m (5 per cent) and £2.9m (14 per 
cent) respectively. In Web Performance we felt the impact of a 
slower take up than expected for a new service line and have 
taken an impairment charge on this business. In Software 
Testing the loss of a project that was already underway at 
the start of the year, following a strategic decision to cancel 
a divestment by the customer, had a negative impact on both 
revenue and costs as utilisation rates for permanent staff fell.
Towards the end of the financial year, both Web Performance 
and Software Testing businesses saw a pick up in sales 
pipeline opportunities and also in some longer term contract 
wins.
The table above can act as a guide to the impact on revenue of 
the proposed disposals of the Web Performance and Software 
Testing businesses during the course of the new financial year 
ending 31 May 2018. Neither business is particularly seasonal 
and therefore any reduction to the Group total turnover 
following the disposals is likely to be pro rated to the point in 
the new year when the businesses are sold.
The Assurance division saw very mixed revenue results during 
the year. While the headline growth rate for the Security 
Consulting activities is very attractive, some business lines saw 
better performance than others. The underlying performance 
of the Security Consulting business lines is much easier to 
understand by using constant currency and also by splitting 
performance between organic and acquisition based growth.  
Assurance revenue is broken down into more detail in the table 
below in terms of the impact of changes in foreign exchange 
rate, the impact of acquisitions in both the prior year and the 
year under review, and the “organic” performance of a number

The table on the opposite page highlights the number and 
variety of moving parts in explaining this year’s revenue 
performance. The impact of changes in FX rates and 
acquisitions are clearly shown in the top half of the table. For 
the purposes of this analysis, given that Fox-IT was acquired 
at the end of November 2015, the whole of the first half of 
the current financial year’s revenue has been attributed to the 
impact of the acquisition.
Growth in UK and US consulting revenues was very 
healthy, representing growth of 19 per cent and 24 per cent 
respectively on a constant currency basis. This was driven 
by a combination of market growth and our ability to capture 
share due to our scale. In addition, we have been bringing new 
products to market and continuing to expand our focus areas 
beyond transactional activity. Within Fox-IT we saw two strong 
opposing forces. As previously announced, a key customer for 
Fox High Assurance products (Fox-HA) significantly slowed 
down its purchases from the business following the change 
in ownership of the company. It is clear that we should have 
engaged with this customer in a transparent way ahead of 
the acquisition to allay some of their concerns. However, we 
have since been working hard and collaboratively to allay the 
concerns of the customer and we are starting to see some 
new orders coming in for Fox-HA products from this critical 
customer. If momentum is maintained we should see some 
growth in this service line in the new financial year compared 
to the year ending 31 May 2017 .
In sharp contrast to Fox-HA, the other Fox service lines saw 
organic growth of 17 per cent in the second half of the year 
compared to the same period of ownership in the prior year. 
In particular, our CTMp platform and Threat Intelligence made 
promising progress. This is particularly pleasing in that both 
of these are key service lines that we aim to expand within 
the Netherlands and then to leverage in other NCC Group 
locations. The scalability of the CTMp platform will also support 
margin recovery. It is for this reason and the emerging recovery 
in Fox-HA, that while the execution challenges for the business 
are reflected in the impairment of around 30 per cent of the 
goodwill associated with the acquisition, we remain confident 
about the prospects for the Fox-IT business and its capability 
to support a broader platform of scalable high value add 
services across NCC Group.
In MSS we also saw two conflicting but slightly different 
themes from those in Fox. The negative force there has 
been in the resale of third party products which fell by £7 .4m 
compared to the prior year, equating to a fall of 48 per cent, 
and a fall in 2017 second half sales of products of almost 
90 per cent to £0.7m. The fall partly reflects the end of an 
earn-out period that had been put in place when the business 
was acquired by the previous owners and subsequently 
extended by NCC Group . In addition, we are trying to change 
our focus to higher value add activities and the building of 
long-term relationships with our customers.
We have not pursued these sorts of sales as strongly as in 
previous years. Instead, where we continue to sell third party 
products, we will aim to link those purchases to implementation 
consulting advice and after sales services such as monitoring 
in our Leeds based Security Operations Centre (SOC). While  
the revenue would have helped the year’s results, we are not 
overly concerned as we seek to deliberately rebalance the 
business away from single transaction reselling of third party 
products. Similar to Fox, in the areas of the business where we 
do see longer term value and growth potential, the service lines 
grew by 17 per cent year-on-year.
The summary of the Assurance revenue is:
 z Good growth was delivered in those areas where we want 
to place our future focus as this is where scalable margin 
recovery can be created. 
 z Fox-HA will start to recover in the coming year. 
 z Reselling third party products in MSS in the medium-term 
will be continued if we can create linkages to our own value 
added after sales services. 
 z Acquisitions and FX also played a strong supporting role in 
the revenue growth story.

OUR PERFORMANCE
ASSURANCE DIVISION – BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW
The table below is based on an estimated split of our 
Assurance revenue streams based on currently available 
information. As noted elsewhere, we will be improving the 
quality and granularity as well as the relevance of our internal 
management information systems over the coming years. The 
data is, however, accurate enough to give a broad indication of 
the split of revenue streams.
2017 2016
Assurance revenue £m
% of 
total £m
% of 
total
Consulting services 156.1 76.2 122.4 72.5
Managed services 24.9 12.1 1 1.8 7 .0
Product sales 23.8 11.6 34.7 20.5
Total 204.7 100.0 168.9 100.0
While revenue grew in total by £35.8m (21 per cent), the 
absolute level of operating profit fell year-on-year by £9.1m 
(35 per cent). The fall in operating profit is all the more stark 
because it is after the positive impact of foreign exchange 
gains of £0.4m and the benefit of acquisitions. The acquisition 
benefits were from a full year of ownership of Fox-IT (£0.5m) 
and part year ownership of PSC and VSR (£1.7m benefit).
The underlying business performance in the Assurance 
division generated £1 1.3m less operating profit than last 
year (down 44 per cent) on £6.8m organic revenue growth. 
Adjusted EBIT margins fell to 8.2 per cent (2016: 15.3 per 
cent). The most significant driver for this was the increase in 
overall salary costs.
Our consulting businesses in the UK and US both saw a 
fall in absolute profitability as a lack of control over the cost 
base meant that it grew faster than our revenue streams. In 
particular, this reflected a strategy to build sales and delivery 
teams ahead of equivalent revenue growth and that led to 
margins being compressed in both businesses at a gross 
margin and EBIT margin level. At the same time, the Group 
was starting to develop its strategic sales capability to allow us 
to move further up our customers’ internal purchasing decision 
chains to become less transactional and more strategic in 
approach. That investment has been slower than anticipated in 
bearing fruit.
The Assurance business will typically see one or two major 
unplanned contract wins in any particular year. These can 
be related to the reaction to a major event at a customer or 
a specific proactive project such as corporate activity. In the 
year to May 2017 , the division did not have a material benefit 
from any such contracts and actually suffered from the loss 
of some. In one specific case, a large-scale Software Testing 
project (referenced above) was already underway with staff 
deployed on the ground. When the customer discontinued the 
contract the revenue stream stopped very quickly in the first 
half, whereas it had been expected to run for most of the year. 
A second large-scale project was cancelled before it began. 
In the third, which had not become a contracted order but 
had been a firm prospect as NCC Group was the preferred 
supplier for that type of work, the customer decided not to 
proceed with the work. The estimated potential revenue from 
the three contracts was around £14-17m and £6-7m of gross 
margin (based on a gross margin assumption of 40 per cent). 
Approximately £7-10m of this revenue had been included in 
the Group’s operating plan at the start of the year.
The most challenged part of the Assurance division was MSS 
which saw a fall in revenue of £4.6m (14 per cent). As noted 
earlier, while much of the revenue fall related to less attractive 
sales of third party products, the gross margin delivered would 
still have been a helpful contribution towards the overhead 
base. 
Similarly to the consulting businesses, in MSS the Group 
set about rebalancing the sales efforts and teams towards 
strategic and higher value added sales of customer solutions, 
comprising product, professional services and managed 
services. While we are confident that this is the correct 
approach in the medium-term, the short term impact was to 
increase our cost base at a time when revenues were falling. 
There was also the impact of ongoing integration challenges 
for the MSS service lines (acquired under the Accumuli plc 
transaction).

How we are  
part of your daily life
ASSURANCE — SECURING SUPPLY CHAINS 
Supplier Assured
Effective information security comprises a number of internal factors that 
are directly within an organisation’s control – e.g. technologies, governance, 
processes and people.  Other factors can be outside of an organisation’s control 
such as interactions with suppliers. 
Third party suppliers can be an attractive way for cyber criminals to gain access 
to data and networks that would otherwise be beyond their reach. A huge range 
of external suppliers, from marketing to accountants to legal firms, may all hold 
intellectual property or sensitive personal information on employees and clients 
or may provide access into an organisation’s environment. 
In order to avoid costly damage to customer confidence, reputation and 
ultimately the share price, organisations must ensure comprehensive security 
audits of third party suppliers and partners are carried out and that all necessary 
security measures are being implemented and maintained.
NCC Group understands that organisations are using an increased number 
of suppliers, and on-site audits for the whole supply chain is not financially 
or operationally feasible. NCC Group has therefore developed a risk based 
approach to help organisations gain assurance that information security risks 
and requirements such as GDPR are managed effectively for their suppliers.
How our business model enables this
NCC Group has worked for a number of years auditing and assessing our 
clients’ supply chains to ensure that they are secure and robust. As such, 
we have made a significant investment in people, processes and technology 
associated with this. More recently, we have developed an end-to-end “Supplier 
Assured” managed service utilising a combination of on-site assessments and 
a remote questionnaire and evidence based validation to deliver a cost effective 
solution to our clients’ third party security.
The service is made up of four key pillars:
1. Supplier Landscape Assessment: We will conduct a questionnaire based 
risk assessment on your entire supplier landscape to help you identify your 
high risk suppliers and quantify how they impact your organisation’s data and 
technologies.
2. Supplier Audit: Suppliers will be asked to complete a 14 domain control 
self-assessment to ensure they have appropriate security controls to 
mitigate key risks. We will review the results of this self-assessment and 
select suppliers for on-site audits to ensure that risks are captured fully and 
effectively.
3. Supplier Remediation Management: We can help manage supplier risk 
remediation programmes by advising on measurable solutions that allow client 
continued assurance that risks are managed in line with business objectives. 
Lessons learnt from all remediation activities will be passed throughout the 
client organisation and its supply chain.
4. Supplier Management Strategy and Remediation: We can help 
strengthen the effectiveness of your supplier management programmes 
by providing assistance where you need it. We can help assess and build 
security controls, policies and procedures, on-boarding security requirements, 
off-boarding requirements etc. and assist in embedding this in your target 
operating model.
NCC Group works with a number of large organisations to successfully deliver 
this service in a modular fashion. Its Supplier Assured managed service is based 
on a secure portal platform to pseudo-automate the supplier review process and 
remove the traditional email and spreadsheet supplier review approach which 
can quickly become unmanageable for a large number of suppliers.   
For one well known supermarket chain we have recently undertaken a proof of 
concept exercise prior to a full roll out of the service, enabling the client to gain a 
clear understanding of the supplier risk landscape and also develop, implement 
and manage an appropriate remediation approach. Over 2,000 suppliers were 
ranked and the top 50 were selected for assessment by NCC Group. To ensure 
new suppliers were included within the tracker, a short-term due diligence 
process was developed with a strategic plan to fully mature the process.  
How we will leverage this going forward

The financial services sector has dealt with online criminal threats for nearly 
two decades yet the threats are ever increasing. Various types of criminals, and 
at times, nation states, have targeted their continuously evolving techniques for 
financial gain at banks and other financial institutions and their customers across 
the globe. 
In addition, espionage is a real and continuous threat for many organisations 
including financial services and governments. A defining feature of espionage is 
that it involves stealing of confidential or sensitive information such as intellectual 
property or PII and that it is designed to go unnoticed. The information may be 
used for competitive advantage or to support geopolitical goals. The damage 
resulting from espionage campaigns is often material and the impact can 
sometimes only be gauged after time. 
How our business model enables  
resilient finance
NCC Group’s Dutch based subsidiary, Fox-IT, has tracked criminal threat groups 
ever since the first attacks on online banking, giving us unique insight into 
criminal organisations, their modus operandi and the tools that they use. We use 
this insight and our knowledge to provide financial institutions with very specific 
and real-time information to detect and mitigate attacks along with contextual 
information about the individuals that may be unwittingly involved in fraud. 
In 2010, one of the largest banks in the Netherlands approached Fox-IT to 
help tackle the problem of fraud. Together, Fox-IT and the bank developed 
an innovative fraud detection platform (DetACT) as a means to directly 
operationalise our threat intelligence in order to help combat attacks such as 
Internet banking and credit card fraud. 
Other banks in the Netherlands joined later in our efforts to reduce damages 
as a result of Internet banking fraud, which peaked to €33m in 2012. Last year, 
fraud damages were less than €1m for the first time since 2007 in the Dutch 
market. Fox-IT is proud to have significantly contributed to this successful 
reduction in risk to the Dutch banking system. 
Globally, financial regulators are increasing the scrutiny of their markets with 
regards to demonstrated cyber resilience with the UK and the Netherlands 
leading these efforts today. NCC Group, as a Bank of England approved provider 
under the CBEST scheme, and Fox-IT, with wider NCC Group support as a De 
Nederlandsche Bank for TIBER scheme, is well placed in the market. These 
accreditations have resulted in NCC Group performing red team engagements 
for some of the most prolific financial market infrastructure providers and 
institutions in the UK, the Netherlands and the wider European market. 
How we will leverage this going forward 
Fox-IT continues to track criminal groups in order to understand how they 
work and predict what they will do next. The more recent blending of criminal 
and espionage operations shows the importance of following these threats 
closely. This in turn helps continuously improve Fox-IT’s fraud detection platform 
and it also feeds its Managed Detection and Response (MDR) platform with 
threats intelligence in order to provide rapid detection of these threats at earlier 
stages, when criminals infect systems that they can later use to carry out fraud. 
Additionally, our fraud detection platform gained traction in other parts of Europe, 
where we are currently helping banks fight fraud. 
Incident Response assignments are opportunities to see attackers live at 
work. They provide valuable information about the attacker’s means, motives 
and technical indicators of successful attacks. Fox-IT and NCC Group use 
information gained from such cases in multiple ways. 
First and foremost, we use it to detect new attacks with our MDR platform that 
protects all our customers. We also use the information for historic analysis to 
determine if any of our other customers has been the victim of an attack similar 
in nature. The insights we obtained during the IR case often lead to innovations 
in our MDR platform, thus continuously improving the platform. Lastly, any 
information about the attackers is used by our threat analysts as a starting point 
for further investigation into that attacker.
For red teaming in the financial sector, as Singapore, Hong Kong, the European 
Central Bank and other regulators implement robust resilience programmes, 
NCC Group’s experience, global reach, scale and technical investment means we 
are well placed to capitalise on market opportunities.

ASSURANCE — AUTOMOTIVE SPECIALISM
The Metrocab is London’s first zero emission capable taxi, developed by Frazer-
Nash Research and Ecotive. The vehicle uses an electric battery and a petrol 
engine, which extends the range of the battery. NCC Group works as a cyber 
security and assurance partner to Frazer-Nash Research to independently advise 
on the security of in-vehicle networks and systems.
Automotive cyber security
Many people talk about modern connected cars as “computers on wheels”. This 
analogy is not technically correct – a better one would be “complex networks on 
wheels”, comprising multiple network technologies and segments, connecting 
a range of different embedded computers from many different suppliers to 
sensors, actuators and display interfaces. Many of the embedded computers 
present within vehicles have been connected to each other for years in closed 
on-board vehicle networks. However, the big change that has prompted cyber 
security concerns in recent years has been the connectivity between the 
on-board vehicle network and the public mobile phone network, connecting 
vehicles to Telematics Service Providers and to the wider Internet. This change 
has required much greater scrutiny of the design and implementation of vehicle 
systems than has previously been deemed necessary, to ensure that remote 
attacks against connected cars cannot result in data theft or safety concerns.
How our business model enables this
NCC Group has been providing cyber security advice and guidance to  
the automotive industry since 2012. Our dedicated Transport Assurance  
Practice constantly updates assessment methodologies, tools and techniques 
through a research-led approach to consultancy. By having specialist technical 
teams, whose cyber security experience is augmented by domain-specific 
knowledge, we are able to provide world-leading services to the global 
automotive supply chain.
How we will leverage this moving forward
We already work as cyber security and assurance partners to many of the 
world’s leading vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers. With our research-led 
approach we are able to foresee new challenges facing the automotive industry, 
from vehicle-based ransomware and security concerns around autonomous 
vehicles, to the impact of GDPR legislation on car manufacturers.

OUR PERFORMANCE
ESCROW DIVISION - BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Revenue performance
The Escrow division now accounts for 15 per cent of Group 
revenues (2016: 17 per cent). Escrow revenue for the year grew 
by £1.8m (5 per cent) to £37 .1m (2016: £35.3m). Excluding the 
impact of FX, at constant currency rates underlying growth was 
£0.1m (0.3 per cent).

UK 25.4 25.7 (1)
USA 7.9 6.2 27
Europe 3.9 3.4 13
Total Escrow revenue 37.2 35.3 5
Escrow UK
Escrow UK revenue was £25.4m (2016: £25.7m). During 
the second half of the year we identified that some invoices 
had been recognised as revenue ahead of the related service 
delivery. The correction of this issue reduced reported revenue 
in the year by £1.0m with an almost equivalent EBIT impact. 
The issue had built up over three years and no individual year 
required a material adjustment and hence the full impact 
was recognised as a one-off, non-recurring, non-cash item 
in the current year. While there was never any question of 
not delivering the service, and in many cases payment was 
received in advance, this revised approach is deemed to be a 
more appropriate application of the Group’s unchanged policy 
on revenue recognition. 
The reported 1 per cent reduction in revenue (2016: 8 per cent 
growth) would have been growth of 3 per cent if not for the 
one-off adjustment.
Escrow UK recurring revenues increased to £14.1m (2016: 
£13.7m) and terminations remain at around 1 1 per cent with 
nearly 90 per cent of all contracts renewed (2016: 90 per 
cent). 
We expect UK growth to remain modest given the relative 
market maturity and our market share.
Escrow USA 
Escrow USA revenues grew by 27 per cent to £7 .9m (2016: 
£6.2m) with recurring revenues of £4.5m. Approximately half 
of this related to the impact of changes in FX rates with the 
balance all being organic growth. In the fourth quarter we 
restructured our senior management and sales team in Escrow 
USA to build further on the significant opportunity we have in 
that country.
Escrow Europe 
Escrow Europe revenues grew by 13 per cent to £3.9m 
(2016: £3.4m) with recurring revenues of £2.1m. However, 
all of this and more was the result of changes in FX rates. On 
an underlying organic basis the business actually shrank by 
3 per cent. This reflects significant management change in our 
European Escrow team that are being addressed in the first 
half of the new financial year.
Escrow Rest of the World 
The division has recently established an office in Dubai to take 
advantage of the Group’s reputation and expertise in a region 
that has good demand potential for escrow services and in 
which we have a number of existing clients, allowing us to build 
a larger footprint in anticipation of Expo 2020.
Our short-term goals for the Escrow division as a whole are:
 z To maintain our market leading position in the UK, delivering 
modest annual organic growth
 z To continue to develop evolving solutions for customers in a 
SaaS and cloud based world
 z To build on our scalable capability in the US
 z To stabilise our relatively small footholds in a number 
of European territories (the Netherlands, Germany, and 
Switzerland)
 z To begin to build out from our new positions in our “Rest of 
the World” offices in Dubai and Singapore
Escrow UK now has 1 1 1 employees (2016: 107), Escrow 
Europe has 12 employees (2016: 15) and the North American 
Escrow businesses have 41 employees (2016: 59).

follows:

Escrow profitability analysis

reporting purposes, RoW EBIT is included within the UK.

Europe 1.9 2.0 (5)
Share of corporate costs (3.9) (3.2) (22)
Total Escrow EBIT 19.1 20.1 (5)
The £1.0m impact on profitability of the revenue recognition 
issue has been noted above. Because the revised approach was 
adopted in the second half of the financial year but applied to 
the year as a whole, it has had a disproportionate impact on the 
reported results in the second half. Excluding this adjustment, 
EBIT for Escrow would have been flat year-on-year.
The division experienced some of the same increases in 
the cost base as seen in the Assurance division but to a 
lesser degree. As a result, EBIT margins in the division fell 
by 5.6 per cent to 5 1.3 per cent (2016: 56.9 per cent) with 
revenue recognition being a one-off 2.6 per cent reduction. 
The revised operating model that is already in place for the 
Escrow teams around the world mean that the division should 
deliver an improvement in margins in the new financial year 
ending May 2018.

ESCROW — BUSINESS CRITICAL  
SOFTWARE CONTINUITY
A leading holiday operator decided to introduce a new reservations system to 
enable all of its high street outlets and businesses to have online access to the 
same real time price information for holiday packages. 
As a way of facilitating the real time availability of hotels, flights and car rental 
information the system was key to the holiday operator’s strategy of improving its 
service in line with its customers’ expectations and booking behaviour. 
The holiday operator began the process of replacing its legacy systems with a 
system that could communicate with the myriad of reservation systems used in 
the travel market and enable agents to give customers instant availability and 
reservation details. 
The system was also designed for use on multiple channels including websites, 
retail shops and call centres. 
The holiday operator takes business continuity for its critical reservation 
infrastructure seriously, so when planning for the new platform it wanted to 
ensure that provisions were in place to protect itself should an event occur that 
had the potential to disrupt the ongoing service of the application and affect 
customer experience. 
How our business model enables this
Following a review of the marketplace and the protection solutions on offer, 
the holiday operator decided to partner with one of the world’s leading 
escrow providers, NCC Group. NCC Group’s software escrow solutions are 
a smart, simple way of managing risk by protecting the huge investment that 
organisations make in software each year. 
Under the terms of an escrow agreement, NCC Group holds a copy of the 
source code behind the business critical application or platform and commits 
to release the material if a “trigger event” should occur that would render the 
software supplier incapable of fulfilling its contractual obligations. If such an 
event occurs, the holiday operator can apply for the material to be released 
quickly and safely, minimising cost and disruption. This would then enable it to 
maintain and support the application in-house or appoint a qualified contractor 
to do so. 
As part of all its escrow agreements, NCC Group carries out an Integrity Test on 
the material received to ensure it is virus free, accessible and of the expected 
type. This process ensures that any obvious mistakes in the deposit are detected 
and resolved.
However, due to the nature of the software in question and the uncertain 
economic climate, NCC Group recommended that as well as ensuring that 
the source code is stored and regularly updated, the holiday operator should 
commission Full Verification testing of the application to ensure that the source 
code deposited could be built into the working system if needed.
NCC Group’s range of verification services are specifically designed to 
remove any uncertainty of what is held in escrow and test the accessibility and 
completeness of the material.
The verification process gives both end users and suppliers complete peace 
of mind. Initially, the verification consultant worked with the supplier through a 
complete build of the source code and then worked with the team at the holiday 
operator to test that the correct application was created. The entire process was 
detailed in a comprehensive report, which the holiday operator can then use as a 
step-by-step manual to build the source code into the working application.
When its software supplier unfortunately went into administration, the holiday 
operator needed to invoke the escrow agreement and requested a source code 
release from NCC Group. The fact that the holiday operator had taken steps to 
mitigate risk, and had ownership of the build reports for the reservation system, 
played a crucial part in the legal negotiations that followed with its supplier’s 
administrators.
Only because the holiday operator had carried out verification of the source 
code through NCC Group’s Full Verification and Build Assured Verification did 
it have a full build report for the business critical reservation infrastructure that 
enabled it to carry on maintaining and supporting the application by appointing 
an alternative contractor to do so.
How we will leverage this going forward
Most businesses rely on IT applications to run important and critical functions 
within their organisation. As the use of IT across organisations continues to grow 
it is increasingly important to ensure that businesses have a plan in place to 
mitigate against the risk of software supplier failure. NCC Group will continue to 
engage with both software providers and our customers to help and form part of 
an organisation’s business continuity plan.

part of your daily life
SOFTWARE TESTING — NEW SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION 
NCC Group’s client, a major luxury fashion retailer, required a testing partner 
who could manage the complex implementation of two third party solutions, 
maintaining the quality standards in parallel development.
The main challenge was the integration of the transformed EPOS system and 
the new loyalty offering, from both a technical and process perspective, into its 
current business model with minimum disruption.
These two projects were of the upmost importance as they will ultimately 
strengthen the client’s position in the retail industry and help it to maintain 
customer loyalty while meeting key strategic goals.
Software is not the client’s core business and it needed a quality partner to bring 
a strong approach as well as a complete testing solution.
How our business model enables this
Given the scale of the EPOS transformation, the client needed absolute clarity 
about how the validation and testing effort would ensure that both technical and 
business requirements were delivered as expected to fully support its business 
strategy and activities.
NCC Group put together a joined-up approach to deliver testing across the 
various transformation areas, ensuring that the solution delivered business value 
for the client. This included:
 z Leveraging NCC Group’s Delivery Centre to provide a remote, on-shore 
capability, with a local test manager to ensure tight communication and 
accountability.
 z Testing of the EPOS system and devices from NCC Group’s Delivery Centre, 
evaluating functionality from front of store to back end systems without 
taking up space in the client’s offices.
 z Testing of the loyalty solution across a range of browsers and devices, 
ensuring consistent customer experience and supporting incentivisation by 
the client.
 z Testing of the international version of the client’s website, validating orders 
across 1 1 7 countries into its fulfilment capability.
 z Testing of the client’s marketplace functionality, allowing customers to order 
directly through to suppliers through the client’s website and ensuring that 
the expansion of this marketplace delivered value to customers.
 z With NCC Group’s support at all stages of the process, the client 
successfully implemented two new key initiatives. The transformed EPOS 
system is now live in one of the main store locations and being rolled out at 
other locations.
 z The new loyalty application is currently being used by its customers and 
the international website and new marketplace have also successfully gone 
live. This allows the client to deliver a competitive retail experience to its 
customers on a global scale.
How we will leverage this going forward
 z The transformation enabled the client to deliver value to customers and 
NCC Group looks forward to working closely with the client as the company 
continues to expand and refine its retail offering.
 z This valued NCC Group client had a number of challenges, including lack of 
expert test consultant skills, shortage of desk space in prime London territory 
and expertise in delivering similar sized, business critical projects. The project 
was both demanding and critical to the continual success of this client both 
online and in store and failure to deliver was not an option. We partnered at 
the most critical stage where business requirements were being determined, 
we introduced testing early into every phase of development, and provided 
this client with a robust strategy to deliver and go live without fault. Key 
delivery points and objectives are below:
 — Previous expertise in sector and project type
 — Ability to scale with the exact skills at speed
 — Flexible on-site / off-site model (but all on-shore)
 — Develop a strategy that would be agreeable by the Board for budget 
approval and sanction
 — Ability to manage all test phases and manage stakeholders to  
Board level
 — Drive down costs where appropriate but without affecting test quality
 — Shared responsibility to meet demanding timescales
 — Secure, highly confidential off-site facilities
