Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
FOCUSED ON 
GROWING 
PROFITS
We are focused on growing  
profits and in 2017 have delivered 
increasing new business margins  
and profits
Introduction
I am pleased to present my CEO Statement 
for 2017. This year marks the first full year’s 
results post-merger (for the combined two 
predecessor businesses, now reporting 
as Just Group plc), and I am immensely 
proud of all we have achieved. We have 
demonstrated that we can adapt and 
respond to the changing retirement and 
regulatory landscapes to meet the needs of 
our customers, deliver improved margins, 
sustainable growth in profits and, in doing 
so, created value for our shareholders. 
Performance review
We compete in attractive growth markets 
and our strategy is focused on growing 
profits not headline sales. Expanding markets 
enable us to achieve profitable growth as 
selecting the most attractive risks is easier 
when there is more business to choose from. 
During 2017 we have improved margins and 
delivered significant growth in new business 
operating profit and adjusted operating 
profit. New business operating profit was 
£169.8m for 2017, an increase of 37% 
compared to the prior year, and adjusted 
operating profit before tax grew in the same 
period by 35% and was £220.6m. IFRS profit 
before tax for 2017 was £181.3m, an increase 
of 5% compared to 2016.
In addition, we have delivered synergy 
benefits of £52m on a run rate basis from the 
merger which is in excess of both our original 
target of £40m and our revised target of 
£45m. This has contributed materially to the 
Group’s new business profitability. 
Our product range across Retirement Income, 
Drawdown and Lifetime Mortgages is well 
established and presents a comprehensive 
offering to at-retirement and in-retirement 
customers. During the year, Retirement 
Income sales rose by 4% to £1,889.9m. 
Once again we are proud to have been 
awarded Financial Adviser 5 Star service 
awards in both the Life & Pensions and 
Mortgages categories, for the 13th and 10th 
consecutive years respectively. This is a great 
achievement and a well-deserved reflection 
of the Just customer experience that we have 
been working so hard to deliver each and 
every day.
Capital and dividends
During the year the Group’s primary 
insurance subsidiary, Just Retirement 
Limited (“JRL”), achieved an inaugural 
Insurer Financial Strength credit rating of 
A+, and in addition JRL and Just Group plc 
achieved Issuer Default Ratings of single A. 
 
Furthermore, the Group improved its 
liquidity options by agreeing a £200m 
revolving credit facility with three banks, 
which remains undrawn.

Mortgages
The Group’s Solvency Capital Requirement 
coverage ratio was estimated at 141% at 
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 
151%), as expected due to the transitional 
measures for technical provisions (“TMTP”) 
recalculation and strong new business 
volumes written during the year, with the 
majority of our own funds comprised of  
Tier 1 capital. Our economic capital ratio at 
31 December 2017 was 238% (31 December 
2016: 216%). 
Since year end our capital position has been
strengthened further by our successful issue
of £230m 7 year Tier 3 capital at a 3.5% 
coupon in February 2018.
The PRA continues to publish industry-wide 
consultation papers and supervisory 
statements setting out its expectations for 
certain aspects of prudential regulation. 
There is a possibility that the implementation 
of one or more of these could result in a 
change to the regulatory capital position of 
the Group. We maintain frequent dialogue 
with regulators to ensure we implement the 
emerging policies appropriately.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 
2.55p per share, a total of 3.72p per share for 
2017. This is an increase of 6% from 2016. 
Colleagues
In each of our markets we have teams 
focused on delivering for our customers. 
It is the hard work, creativity and 
determination of these teams that enable 
Just to succeed. Our colleagues ensure 
we continue to respond effectively to the 
changing external environment and their 
resilience and enthusiasm were critical to 
the Group achieving the excellent set of 
results we have reported. My thanks go 
to all our colleagues across the Group for 
their hard work and support throughout the 
year and for their determination to make a 
positive difference to our customers’ lives.
And finally…
We have delivered what we set out to 
achieve during the year, including the 
implementation of our new brand, Just. 
The rollout of the new brand has provided 
the opportunity to bring together the best 
of our predecessor companies and has 
encouraged our talented colleagues across 
the Group to create new ways of achieving 
our mission to deliver a fair, fulfilling and 
secure retirement for our customers. The 
outlook remains favourable for each of our 
key businesses. We have demonstrated our 
ability to grow profits and position the Group 
to select the most attractive risks so that we 
may grow sustainably and deliver value to 
our shareholders, outstanding service to our 
customers and opportunities for our people.
