 Whether it is prototyping new 
technologies, opening our first 
consumer innovation lab, Studio B, 
or collaborating with Fintech partners 
with the development of our new 
small business e-lending solution, 
we are building a bank focused on 
a differentiated customer experience 
that will put customers more in 
control of their money. 
I am delighted to report that we have maintained 
momentum in delivering our strategic priorities and 
commitments and, as a result, we are delivering 
significantly improved financial performance, have 
recorded our first statutory profit in over five years 
and are recommending an inaugural dividend to 
shareholders. 
As the only truly full-service challenger bank of 
scale across both Retail and SME in the UK market, 
we have delivered ahead of market growth in both 
mortgages and SME lending and we remain on track 
to deliver our commitment to provide up to £6bn 
of lending to SMEs by the end of 2019. 
Our results show improved underlying profit, 
sustainable loan growth, a stable margin and 
improved returns – all achieved in a highly 
competitive market and a continuing low growth, 
low interest rate environment. Our cost efficiency 
programme is also ahead of plan, with underlying 
operating costs coming in at £675m, down 7% year 
on year. We have also continued to work through 
our legacy conduct issues and our statutory profit 
includes the impact of a conduct charge of £58m 
primarily due to historical payment protection 
insurance (PPI) mis-selling.
CYBG is perfectly placed to disrupt the market – 
we have the size and full-service Retail and SME 
capabilities that no other UK challenger bank can 
offer, yet we are smaller and more agile than the 
complex structures of the ‘big five’ UK banks.  
We are well capitalised, have a high-quality loan 
book and prudent risk appetite, along with powerful, 
established local brands. These have now been 
joined by an innovative brand in B, which has 
broadened our customer demographic and reach 
outside of our core regions. We have over 100,000 
B customers since launch in 2016 and we were 
proud to receive the FStech Award 2017 for Digital 
Launch of the Year. 
The pace and scale of transformation across our 
business has been considerable in 2017. We have kept 
up our relentless focus on enhancing our customers’

Chief Executive Officer’s review
experience through operational improvements and 
have maintained excellent progress on the delivery 
of our plan to provide a truly omni-channel model 
for customers. As part of our digital journey, over 
the past year we have introduced straight-through 
online account opening, Apple and Android Pay, as 
well as piloting an innovative new online SME lending 
facility through one of our Fintech partnerships. 
In addition, our migration of our Clydesdale and 
Yorkshire Bank accounts to our digital platform, iB, is 
well advanced and we expect all personal customers 
to begin migrating to iB on the web by the end of 
2017 with SME customers to begin migration onto 
iB, both mobile and web, in 2018. 
Like other banks and high street retailers we are 
seeing a shift in the way customers choose to do 
business with us and more often customers are 
using telephone, internet and mobile channels to 
do day-to-day banking. As a result, the number of 
transactions which take place in branches is falling, 
with customers increasingly using a branch only 
when they want to speak with us about a significant 
life event. We are constantly reviewing our branch 
footprint and while a number of branches were 
closed this year, we opened new flagship branches 
in Edinburgh and Birmingham as part of a broader 
multiyear strategy to expand our presence in key 
northern cities. 
In April, we opened our innovation lab, Studio B, 
in London. Unlike anything else on the high street, 
Studio B enables us to collaborate directly with 
customers and other interested parties on the 
design of future banking products and services, then 
showcase and test our best ideas with colleagues, 
customers and members of the public – all within 
a fully functioning customer banking centre. While 
in September we expanded our UK presence into 
Birmingham with the opening of a next generation 
B store which, as well as being a fully operational 
branch, is also a showcase for customers to 
experience our digital innovations. 
Over the next 12 months I am confident we have 
both the opportunity and the ability to create a 
differentiated customer experience that positions us 
as a progressive, forward-looking organisation able to 
thrive today, tomorrow and in the future, delivering 
on commitments to our customers, our people and 
our shareholders. Finally, I am very grateful to the 
Chairman, the Board and our colleagues for their 
backing and insight as we continue on our journey.

OUR FIRST AGM  
AS A LISTED BUSINESS
Our Board and members of our Executive Leadership 
Team travelled to Australia in January for our first AGM 
as a listed business. We fully recognise that a significant 
proportion of our shareholders are not based in the UK 
and we believe it’s important that we are able to speak 
to people face to face about CYBG and our strategy for 
growing the business.
The decision to host the AGM in Melbourne was warmly received and well 
attended – we welcomed more than 250 people to the event and an even 
wider audience joined via a live webcast.
The overall tone of the event was positive, reflecting on the solid progress 
we have made in our landmark first year.
