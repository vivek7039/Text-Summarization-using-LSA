Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Driving the value
I have been CEO of Stobart 
Group for almost 10 years and 
during that time we have 
generated a compound 
shareholder return of around 
10% p.a. We have also 
developed Energy and Aviation 
platforms to deliver our targets 
to 2018 and beyond. The Group 
is now uniquely placed as an 
entrepreneurial public limited 
company that creates value, 
supported by its strong heritage 
in logistics and systems and 
with a real focus on delivering 
great customer service. With a 
market capitalisation of close to 
£800m, a strong balance sheet 
and a progressive dividend 
policy, the Group is well placed 
to continue to deliver strong 
returns to shareholders for the 
foreseeable future.
Highlights and  
History of Stobart Group
2004: Purchased Eddie Stobart Limited 
for £2m – previously losing £10m per 
annum in 2003.

the London Stock Exchange through a 
£138m reverse takeover of Westbury

transport and rail business. 
2008: Created a platform for a 
multimodal logistics business.
2009: Invested in London Southend 
Airport with its 45 minute rail link to 
London.
2010: Purchased initial 50% of Stobart 
Energy, subsequently increased to 
100%, that has now become the 
leading supplier of biomass in the UK.
2012: Invested in Stobart Air, a 
Dublin-based regional airline that now 
operates under the Aer Lingus brand, 
and an aircraft leasing business.
2012: Purchase of Moneypenny 
property portfolio, which subsequently 
delivered a 22.5% IRR.
2012: Autologic acquired for £12m and 
since realised 6x money multiple.
2014: Reconstituted the Stobart Group 
Board under the chairmanship of Iain 
Ferguson CBE (ex Unilever and CEO  
of T ate & Lyle plc). 
2014: Sale of 51% of Eddie Stobart 
Logistics (ESL) when the Group had a 
market capitalisation c.£475m, realising 
£196m of cash to reduce debt levels 
and strengthen the balance sheet. 
2017: ESL floated on AIM with a market 
capitalisation of £573m delivering a 
return of 4.2x since the sale of 51% in 
2014, creating significant value for 
shareholders. ESL being transformed 
from a road transport to a logistics and 
distribution business operating across 
a broad range of sectors underpinned 
by blue chip customers.
Where are we today? 
Stobart Group now comprises three core 
operating divisions in sectors with real 
growth opportunities. Our Energy, Aviation 
and Rail civil engineering businesses are 
all well placed for profitable growth over 
the next five years. Our Infrastructure 
and Investments divisions continue their 
programme of divestment, creating 
further value for shareholders. 
Energy – this year has been about 
establishing the foundations of 
infrastructure, logistics and people 
to ensure our ability to deliver on our 
long-term fuel supply contracts into 
over 20 biomass plants around the UK. 
Widnes and Tilbury storage processing 
sites are now up and running and 
those plants are progressing towards 
commissioning. Development of other 
processing sites at Port Clarence 
and Rotherham is also underway. 
A full management team is now in 
place, focused on professionalising 
the industry to deliver long-term 
sustainable supply and management 
of predominantly recycled wood under 
long-term index-linked contracts. 
Aviation – a significant year for the 
Aviation division with continued 
development of our airport, London 
Southend, which we believe will play a 
key part in providing capacity for the 
constrained London air travel market. 
A London airport that has technical 
capacity to handle 10m+ passengers, 
45 minutes from London, will over time 
be a very valuable asset for the Group. 
We have consolidated our regional 
airline and aircraft leasing businesses, 
taking full ownership, and will continue 
to develop our valuable long-term 
franchise with Aer Lingus as well as 
support Flybe in the Isle of Man and 
from our London Southend Airport.  11

Rail and Non-Rail Civil Engineering – 
our Rail business continues to support 
speciality work for Network Rail as well 
as being a tier 2 supplier to the industry. 
We expect to see continued growth under 
the Stobart brand. The non-rail business 
has also supported infrastructure projects 
in our Energy and Aviation divisions by 
providing an efficient low-cost value 
engineering construction solution. 
Infrastructure – our plan to divest non-
core infrastructure assets continues and 
we have delivered against our plan this 
year. The business is also very good at 
providing asset management initiatives 
working alongside our Rail division, 
and delivering on-time and to budget. 
Investments – the post year-end IPO of 
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc valued the 
Group’s 49% investment at £184.8m, 
significantly ahead of the year-end 
carrying value of £58.4m and realised 
cash of £113.3m. This is a great example 
of how we have created significant value 
for the Group and our shareholders. 
People
One of my personal business 
beliefs is to employ people that are 
better than yourself and I see this 
as a strength from a shareholder 
perspective as well as CEO. 
Working together with our new Group 
CEO, Warwick Brady, whom I have known 
for several years and worked closely 
alongside for the last six months, I believe 
that we can bring extensive value to the 
Group. I am strongly of the view that 
Warwick’s industry-wide knowledge and 
experience will help grow and support 
the entire Group. I am confident that his 
business experience and entrepreneurial 
approach will be a key part in the next 
chapter of Stobart Group’s value creation.
Energy – headed by Ben Whawell, CEO 
Stobart Energy and the ex-Group CFO. 
We have worked together for the last 
17 years and I am confident that he has 
the skills and experience to move the 
Energy business to the next level and 
create significant shareholder value.
Aviation – this division includes 
airports, a regional airline and an aircraft 
leasing company. These businesses 
all have potential and are supported 
by our proven logistics expertise. 
The teams within this division, led 
by Glyn Jones, will support Warwick 
in delivery of our objectives.
Rail – Managing Director Kirk T aylor, of 
our Rail and non-rail civil engineering 
business, has worked with me since 
1994. He is diligent and passionate 
about our business and can grow Rail 
to be the number one specialist provider 
to the rail and construction industry, 
as well as supporting the Group in any 
value-adding infrastructure projects.
Whilst I am handing over the reins to 
lead and run Stobart Group to Warwick, 
Ben, Glyn and Kirk, as the third largest 
shareholder, I believe that we are now 
on the next stage of our journey that 
will realise the significant potential of 
the Group over the coming years. 
As a key founder of Stobart Group, I am 
committed to remaining on the Board for 
the foreseeable future and to supporting 
Warwick’s transition to Group CEO. I 
will support the Executive Management 
team and the Board by devoting 50% of 
my time to the Group and the delivery 
of further significant shareholder value. 
The remainder of my time will be 
spent working with Richard Butcher to 
deliver value in our Infrastructure and 
Investments divisions and, in particular in 
launching and developing Stobart Capital, 
bringing together the Group’s investment 
activities under a new value creation unit. 
This will be a platform, working alongside 
external professionals and exploiting my 
entrepreneurial skills and experience, 
to bring investment opportunities to the 
Group that complement the strategy, 
and have the potential to create 
further returns for shareholders.
I would like to thank Richard for his 
valued contribution to the business over 
many years and also thank Mark for his 
work as interim CFO over recent months.
