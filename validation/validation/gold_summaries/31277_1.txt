Introduction
2017 was a challenging year for Velocys, 
but despite this, the Company has made 
significant progress towards developing 
what we expect will be the first of a 
number of repeatable biorefineries. Our 
strategy is for Velocys to be at the heart 
of building plants that convert forestry 
residues into renewable fuels for the US 
market. Considerable headway has been 
made on the interrelated work streams 
required to progress the US Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) loan guarantee 
programme, including the delivery of the 
FEL -2 engineering study , and securing 
a 100-acre site in Natchez, Mississippi. 
The performance milestones the Velocys 
Fischer- Tropsch (FT) system reached at 
a commercial scale at ENVIA during 2017 
and the first part of 2018 were crucial 
milestones on the way to delivering our 
future biorefineries.
None of this would be possible without the 
efforts of our talented, energetic team that 
has stepped up to the challenges we have 
faced with great determination, skill and 
prior experience. I particularly thank them 
for their professionalism during the internal 
restructuring process undertaken in the 
summer of 2017 .
Strategy implementation
With the ENVIA biorefinery in operation, 
the Company has the required commercial 
and technology springboard from which 
it aims to deliver its bold, long-term 
vision to place Velocys at the forefront of 
production of cellulosic renewable fuels. 
With a reorganisation of the senior team 
and the appointment of John Tunison as 
Interim CFO we now have a strong Executive 
Committee to bring decisive leadership 
to deliver this goal. 
The three pillars of the strategy we have 
adopted are outlined on page 3. We are all 
focused on the delivery of the next phase on 
this journey . We are building a consortium 
of strategic and financial partners to deliver 
investment, scale and pace to market 
and are leveraging the Company’s project 
management, commercial, engineering, 
operational and technology expertise to 
optimise future plant costs and timelines. 
In the summer of 2017 , after it had 
been demonstrated that the Velocys 
technology installed at ENVIA ’s Oklahoma 
City plant was performing as expected 
at a commercial scale, we concluded 
that the primary phase of our technology 
development programme had been 
successfully completed. In July 2017 we 
ceased certain R&D activities and total 
headcount was reduced from 76 at the 
end of 2016 to 42 at the end of 2017 . 
The changes made allowed us to direct 
our resources towards those business-
critical areas in which milestone-delivery 
is all important in the short and medium 
term. They will also reduce the ongoing 
operational costs of the business by nearly 
£2m per year .
The Company has maintained a corporate 
and commercial office in the UK, from 
where it will direct the implementation 
of its strategy and commercialisation 
of its considerable intellectual property 
portfolio. These UK-based capabilities 
are now located at the Harwell Science 
and Innovation Campus, and include the 
project management team supporting the 
UK waste-to-renewable jet fuel project. 
We will continue to expand and develop our 
capability to develop our US biorefineries 
from our operational base in Houston. In 
addition, we will further scale up resources 
to support the clients licensing our 
technology as well as to ensure protection 
of our intellectual property .
Our two fundraises in the last 12 months 
have provided us with a runway to 
implement our strategy , most notably to 
support the plan to achieve final investment 
decision (FID) for the Mississippi biorefinery 
project. As outlined in the Financial review 
(see page 17) further funding is required to 
reach this milestone. The Financial review 
(and note 17) also outlines the reasons 
behind a significant write down in value  
of certain assets, mostly Goodwill and  
In-process technology made in these  
report and accounts.
Our biorefineries
ENVIA
In 2Q 2018 we announced the disappointing 
news that a leak has been detected at the 
Oklahoma City plant that is believed to 
have originated inside one of the plant’s 
two FT reactors. Based on a preliminary 
investigation the Company believes the 
root cause of the issue originated with the 
design of an ancillary system and is not 
a result of a flaw in the core Velocys FT 
technology . The Company is working with 
ENVIA and third party consultants to verify 
the root cause of the leak. Velocys remains 
committed to the ENVIA plant and will work 
with ENVIA to assess the likely repair cost 
and consequent funding requirements. 
Successive milestones were met at ENVIA 
over the course of 2017 , as outlined on 
page 10. Most recently (post-period end), 
we were pleased to report that the RINs 
produced at ENVIA were verified under the 
Quality Assurance Program approved by 
the US Environmental Protection Agency . 
ENVIA has achieved significant milestones 
in the last 12 months, notwithstanding 
a number of other challenges. For example, 
in Q2 2017 , the Engineering, Procurement 
and Construction (EPC) contractor entered 
bankruptcy proceedings; the plant was 
down or in reduced operation for several  Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 9

weeks in early 2018 (post-period end) 
while repairs were carried out after 
extreme cold weather; and, as part of 
normal plant commissioning, a series of 
improvements have been made to control 
systems and other equipment to minimise 
plant downtime and improve reliability . 
More details are given on page 10. 
After the experiences of the last 12 months, 
I have enormous confidence in Velocys’ 
highly-skilled technical team that are called 
on by ENVIA to support the Oklahoma plant. 
While ENVIA remedies the present issue, 
ENVIA ’s aim will be to operate the plant 
using one reactor . ENVIA is working with 
Velocys, the licensor , to develop a solution 
that will return the plant to full operation 
with minimal loss of revenue, whilst always 
assuring safety and minimising the risk 
of adverse impact to the environment. 
Working through these obstacles at 
the Oklahoma plant has afforded a 
number of learning opportunities that 
Velocys will apply to future biorefineries, 
reducing technology risk and further 
optimising operations.
An impairment was made against Velocys’ 
investment in ENVIA, predominantly driven 
by a less ambitious revenue forecast based 
on a revision of operational availability and 
product and RIN pricing. 
Mississippi biorefinery
Throughout 2017 we made encouraging 
progress towards the development of our 
first biorefinery in the US using woody 
biomass as feedstock (see pages 12 and 
13 for more details). We welcome the 
significant support for the plant at county 
and state levels. The local community 
has responded positively to the prospect 
of the quality jobs that the construction 
and operation of the plant would bring 
to the area.
Velocys and its partners are making 
progress towards completing all the 
required work packages to deliver 
a successful USDA loan guarantee 
application, secure project investment 
and deliver the FID. Velocys selected an 
engineering partner to carry out a scoping 
and optimisation study . Velocys and its 
engineering partner are working through 
the complex process of cost and value 
engineering, to optimise plant capital 
cost, operating cost, carbon intensity and 
the financial returns from the project. 
Reaching FID will be subject to securing 
further funding (see further details in the 
Financial review on pages 16 and 17). Other 
significant risks identified and associated 
mitigation actions with the project 
development programme are outlined on 
pages 20 to 22.
Our target is to secure a conditional 
commitment from the USDA in Q3 2018, 
and to reach FID in 2H 2019. These, and 
other intermediate milestones, are outlined 
in the timeline on page 12. 
Although our focus is the delivery of 
the Mississippi biorefinery project, 
we are looking beyond this plant, as our 
strategic plan is to put in place strategic 
partnerships that will deliver multiple 
biorefineries. The site selection process 
for the Mississippi biorefinery produced 
a list of other highly suitable sites in 
a number of other states.
UK waste-to-renewable jet fuel
Consistent with our core strategy of 
delivering biorefineries producing 
renewable fuels, in Q3 2017 we entered 
into an industry partnership to develop 
a waste-to-jet fuel plant in the UK. 
Our approach to this opportunity 
leverages further our technology, 
integrated plant design and skills base. 
Velocys intends to license its technology 
to the plant and provide project 
management, engineering, operations 
and technical service support to the 
project. The other project partners include 
British Airways, that intends to offtake 
the jet fuel produced. Velocys has led 
the initial feasibility stage of the project, 
for which all members of the partnership 
provided  funding. 
Velocys believes that there is an 
opportunity to develop a series of waste-
to-jet fuel plants in the UK and recognises 
that there is a larger non-UK market to be 
exploited. The changes to the Renewable 
Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO), 
recently passed through Parliament, have 
provided the commercial platform for 
this opportunity; for the first time, jet fuel 
is to qualify for credits under the RTFO. 
These changes to the RTFO are designed 
to promote sustainable aviation and 
heavy goods transport and are expected 
to provide long-term policy support for 
this market. 
Biorefinery being developed  
by Red Rock Biofuels
In May 2018 (post-period end) Velocys’ 
customer, Red Rock Biofuels (RRB), 
started constructing the biorefinery it 
is developing in Oregon, USA, which will 
incorporate Velocys’ technology. The third 
party developer has issued a notice to 
proceed for the manufacture of Velocys’ 
FT reactors and catalyst. RRB’s Lakeview 
project is expected to deliver around $15m 
revenues to Velocys during construction 
and early operations of the plant, and 
an additional $30m or more over the life 
of the biorefinery. Over $6m has already 
been invoiced and received from RRB.
The licensing of our technology to Red Rock 
Biofuels biorefinery is complementary 
to our strategy to develop our own 
biorefineries. 
Outlook
I believe we will look back at 2017 as the 
year Velocys transformed into a renewable 
fuels company. Although some of these 
changes were difficult they have set up 
the Company for the future delivery of 
multiple biorefineries and long-term 
sustainable growth. The ENVIA plant has 
validated our FT technology at commercial 
scale and from this platform we plan to 
grow and be at the forefront of supplying 
significant quantities of cellulosic 
renewable fuels. We have a demanding 
plan to deliver in 2018, but we are well 
placed to meet these challenges.
