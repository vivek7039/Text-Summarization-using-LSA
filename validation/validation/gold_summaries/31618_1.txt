Actively manage the portfolio
The	Group	will	continue	to	
implement	a	more	rigorous	
approach	to	allocation	of	capital.	
Having	deliberately	segmented	its	
business	into	Core	and	Non-Core,	this	
development	is	enabling	management	
to	increase	its	focus	on	events	that	
present	the	greatest	opportunities	whilst	
reducing	distraction	from	smaller	events.
The	Core	shows	are	of	strategic	importance	
to	our	future	and	include	the	Group’s	
largest	shows,	those	with	the	greatest	
potential	for	growth	and	a	number	of	
smaller	but	strategically	important	shows.	
The	Non-Core	shows	consist	of	smaller	
shows	with	less	potential	for	growth.	
As	part	of	the	Group’s	strategy,	a	top	
priority	remains	to	apply	a	full	suite	
of	transformational	levers	to	its	Core	
events	to	realise	their	full	potential.	This	
includes investing in content to drive 
great	customer	experience,	retention	
and	pricing.	Each	segment	of	the	Group’s	
portfolio	requires	a	different	degree	of	
focus	and	different	transformational	
levers	to	maximise	their	growth.
Our	international	sales	structures	have	
been	repositioned	to	focus	on	our	
Core	market-leading	events	and	this	
has	seen	strong	revenue	growth	which	
has	offset	the	cancellation	of	smaller,	
Non-Core,	low	yielding	events.	
During	the	year	we	discontinued	37	
unprofitable,	or	less	profitable,	shows.	
In	line	with	its	product-led	strategy,	the	
Group	will	continue	to	proactively	review	
its	portfolio	on	an	ongoing	basis.
Work	is	underway	to	develop	an	‘ITE	
way’,	creating	a	blueprint	to	run	events	
that	is	consistent	globally.	With	the	
‘Best	Practice’	team	now	established,	
the	Group	has	implemented	new	
performance	management	processes	
and	sales	incentive	schemes,	leading	to	
demonstrable	results	as	it	transitions	
towards	a	sales-led	performance	culture.
One	area	of	particular	focus	has	been	onsite	
rebooking	at	a	number	of	Core	events,	
and	this	has	been	successful	in	improving	
sales	visibility	into	the	next	financial	year.
Overall,	the	programme	is	progressing	
according	to	plan	with	implementation	
underway	and	progress	evidenced	
across	the	five	levers:
Product-led acquisitions
In	due	course	the	Group	will	look	to	
make	selective	product-led	acquisitions	
to	accelerate	growth	in	line	with	its	strict	
M&A	criteria.	Each	opportunity	will	be	
carefully	reviewed	but	will	not	be	limited	
to	any	particular	geography	as	the	Group	
aims	to	run	the	best	shows	in	the	best	
industries	anywhere	in	the	world.
Several	criteria	will	determine	what	
the	Group	will	consider.	Acquisitions	
are	likely	to	meet	most,	but	not	
necessarily	all,	of	the	following:
–	 Scalability	–	in	sectors	with	high	growth	
potential 
–	 A	distinct	customer	value	proposition	–	
serving	a	clear	part	of	an	industry	sector
–	 Position	in	attractive	markets	for	events	
–	serving	a	high	growth	underlying	
market	
–	 Evidence	of	strong	organic	revenue	
growth	and	profit	margins
–	 Potential	to	roll	out	internationally	–	
dependent on the product 
–	 Earnings	accretive	–	offering	a	good	
return on invested capital
The	Group	is	building	a	pipeline	of	
product-led	opportunities,	but	will	
only	proceed	if	such	opportunities	
meet	most	of	these	criteria.
Trading
Having	focussed	our	early	efforts	on	
sales	and	marketing	initiatives	in	order	to	
drive	trading	performance,	I	am	pleased	
to	report	we	have	started	to	see	tangible	
evidence	of	progress.	All	sales	people	
across	the	Group	have	been	set	monthly	
sales	targets	and	a	new	commission	
structure	has	been	rolled	out.	This	has	led	
to	monthly	sales	league	tables	which	are	
continually	reviewed	and	has	enhanced	
visibility.	We	have	also	announced	‘Club	
Elite’.	This	initiative	recognises	and	rewards	
our	top	sales	talent	on	a	quarterly	basis	
and	is	instilling	a	culture	of	success.	It	
has	proven	so	effective	that	we	have	
actively	rolled	this	out	across	the	Group	
to	incorporate	marketing,	content	and	
support	services,	enabling	us	to	embed	
and	reward	high	performing	talent.	
I	am	pleased	to	say	that	these	early	
initiatives	have	contributed	to	our	
performance,	as	the	Group	has	
posted	its	first	year	of	like-for-like	
revenue	growth	in	four	years.
Operating rhythm
Efforts	to	refocus	the	organisation	on	
organic	trading	in	the	last	year	and	
embed	a	culture	of	engagement	are	
well	underway.	For	example,	we	have	
introduced	weekly	trading	meetings,	weekly	
review	of	sales,	monthly	regional	boards,	
event	level	strategy	pre	and	post	show,	
and	new	global	communication	channels	
to	showcase	event	successes	globally,	
helping	staff	to	feel	part	of	‘One	ITE’. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Statement

Philosophies
ITE’s	approach	is	based	on	a	view	
of	what	our	customers	want	–	and	
to	be	clear,	customers	include	both	
exhibitors	and	visitors.	Customer	
needs	are	continually	evolving.	
Return	on	Investment	(ROI)	is	now	a	key	
metric	for	exhibitors	and	an	increasing	
request	to	justify	spend	and	demonstrate	
return.	ROI	is	typically	best	delivered	
by	attending	the	main	event	in	any	
given	sector,	since	that	will	deliver	the	
largest	and	most	relevant	audience.
For	visitors,	Return	on	Time	(ROT)	is	
equally	important.	They	don’t	have	time	
to	visit	every	event	and	so	they	will	choose	
the	event	that	delivers	the	best	ROT.	
ROT	is	also	typically	best	delivered	by	
the	main	event,	with	the	largest	number	
of	exhibitors,	content,	networking	
opportunities	and	the	best	experience.
Running	market-leading	events	is	
therefore	critical,	and	it	is	becoming	
harder	and	harder	to	successfully	
run	second	tier	events,	since	they	
can’t	compete	on	ROI	or	ROT.	
In	response	to	this	we	are	making	content	
investment	a	priority.	Visitors	no	longer	
want	to	attend	events	that	act	just	as	
trading	platforms.	Good	quality	events	
have	become	places	to	learn,	network,	
discuss	and	debate;	they	act	as	an	
industry	platform,	bringing	a	business	
community	together	under	one	roof.
Visitors	use	events	to	gauge	what	their	
competitors	are	doing	and	where	their	
industry	is	going,	and	so	investing	in	
high	quality	content	–	from	distinguished	
keynote	speakers	to	detailed	technical	
seminars	–	is	critical	to	engage	and	
drive	high	quality	audiences	and	
senior	levels	of	participation.
New	technology	has	also	impacted	
the	industry.	People	once	thought	
that	technology	would	diminish	the	
need	for	face-to-face	events,	but	in	
reality	it	is	the	opposite.	Technology	
has	enabled	organisers	to	be	more	
efficient,	engage	better	with	our	
customers,	and	help	them	measure	
return	on	investment	more	effectively.	
New	technology	also	enables	organisers	
to	drive	retention	since	improving	events	
drives	increases	in	retention	rates	for	
exhibitors	and	increases	in	visitor	numbers.	
This	in	turn	attracts	new	business.
Retention	in	an	events	business	is	crucial.	
In	order	to	focus	on	retention	you	need	
detailed	customer	insight	and	data	analysis.
Market-leading	events	–	ROI	/	ROT Customer	insight	and	data
Content-led	–	high	on	relevance Customer	service
Retention-led	business	 
enabled	by	technology
Strong	sales	and	marketing	
performance-based	culture
This	ties	directly	into	customer	service,	
where	earlier	booking	of	exhibitors	
generally	improves	retention	by	helping	
them	to	prepare	for	a	successful	event.
Within	the	organisation	itself,	I	believe	
in	a	strong	performance-based	culture	
both	in	sales	and	marketing.	Training,	
monitoring,	managing	performance	
and	breeding	a	culture	of	success	by	
rewarding	achievement	is	the	basis	for	
strong	sustainable	organic	growth.
We	believe	that	a	strong	sales	and	
marketing	culture,	with	an	emphasis	
on	quality	of	events,	retention	and	
operational	efficiency	can	drive	sustainable	
growth	and	shareholder	value.
Priorities for 2018
The	Group	has	achieved	much	in	a	short	
space	of	time	since	we	announced	our	
evolved	strategy	and	TAG	programme.	
2017	has	put	in	place	the	building	
blocks	and	we	believe	that	we	have	the	
elements	in	place	to	succeed.	Now	it	is	
about	rigorous	attention	to	detail	and	
execution	of	our	plan.	In	the	year	ahead,	
our	main	focus	within	TAG	will	be	on	lead	
generation,	content	and	customer	service.	
Outlook
Whilst	we	continue	to	roll	out	the	TAG	
programme	across	our	Core	events,	we	
remain	focussed	on	trading	performance.	
The	stabilisation	of	trading	conditions	in	
Moscow	is	having	a	positive	impact	on	
the	outlook	for	next	year,	but	is	tempered	
by	challenging	trading	conditions	
elsewhere	in	the	markets	in	which	we	
operate.	As	at	24	November	2017,	the	
Group	has	contracted	£98m	of	revenues	
in	respect	of	2018	events,	compared	to	
£81m	at	this	stage	last	year	in	respect	
of	2017	events.	This	represents	an	
increase	of	20%	on	a	like-for-like	basis.	
The	Board	remains	confident	of	the	Group’s	
prospects	as	it	enters	the	new	financial	
year.	ITE	is	well	placed	to	realise	its	vision	
of	creating	the	world’s	leading	portfolio	of	
content-driven,	must-attend	events	that	
deliver	an	outstanding	experience	and	ROI	
for	our	customers.	A	fast	pace	has	been	
set	in	the	last	year	which	we	look	forward	
to	continuing	into	2018	and	beyond.

ITE	organises	high	quality	international	
business-to-business	events	globally,	
running	exhibitions	in	15	countries	in	2017.
We	have	been	operating	in	emerging	
markets	and	developing	economies	
for	over	20	years	and	have	developed	
extensive	experience	and	local	knowledge.	
As	a	Group	we	are	focussed	on	improving	
the	quality	of	the	events	we	operate	
and	are	pursuing	a	product-led	strategy,	
focussed	on	market-leading	events,	
irrespective	of	geographic	location	or	
industry	segment.	
We	hire	exhibition	space	from	local	venue	
owners	and	generate	our	revenues	
primarily	from	the	sale	of	exhibition	
space	at	our	events,	charging	exhibitors	
by	the	square	metre	for	space	sold.	Our	
exhibitors	use	our	exhibitions	as	sales	
and	marketing	events,	where	they	interact	
with	visitors,	promote	new	and	existing	
products,	generate	leads	and	ultimately	
make	sales.
Both	our	exhibitors’	and	visitors’	needs	are	
continually	evolving.	ROI	is	a	key	metric	for	
our	exhibitors,	while	ROT	is	becoming	a	
key	metric	for	visitors.	To	run	and	maintain	
market-leading	events	we	are	committed	
to	investing	in	content,	to	ensure	our	
events	are	places	to	learn,	network,	
discuss	and	debate.	Our	events	act	as	an	
industry	platform,	bringing	a	business	
community	together	under	one	roof.

1	 We	have	identified	successful	execution	of	the	TAG	programme	as	a	principal	risk	(see	page	52).	 
This	represents	a	risk	to	achieving	the	Group’s	vision.
The	TAG	programme,	announced	in	May	
2017,	is	being	implemented	to	transform	
the	Group	and	position	it	to	achieve	its	
vision.	The	ultimate	success	of	the	Group	
will	come	through	realising	its	vision,	which	
is	underpinned	by	five	strategic	priorities,	
set	out	opposite.	Each	of	these	has	been	
identified	with	the	Group’s	vision	in	mind.
Key	performance	indicators	(KPIs)	
have	been	identified	and	linked	to	the	
strategic	priorities.	Data	is	not	currently	
available	to	report	performance	against	
all	of	these	KPIs	–	this	will	come	with	
the	full	implementation	of	TAG	and	
the	roll-out	of	the	new	global	CRM	and	
finance	systems	–	but	a	number	of	these	
measures	are	already	being	reported	
against	internally.	The	KPIs	are	expected	
to	evolve	over	time	as	TAG	becomes	fully	
implemented	and	the	Group	focusses	
on	its	longer-term	strategic	aims.

Chief Financial Officer’s  
Statement
We	delivered	like-for-like	growth	
for	the	first	time	since	2013,	up	
5%,	reflecting	the	successful	
roll-out	of	the	first	wave	of	our	
TAG	initiatives,	assisted	by	the	
stabilisation	of	Moscow.
Revenues	for	the	year	were	£152.6m	(2016:	
£134.4m),	as	we	delivered	like-for-like	
growth	for	the	first	time	since	2013,	up	5%.
Overview
This	growth	reflects	the	successful	roll-out	
of	the	first	wave	of	our	TAG	initiatives,	
such	as	a	new	sales	incentive	structure,	
assisted	by	the	stabilisation	of	Moscow	and	
in	spite	of	challenging	trading	conditions	
in	some	of	our	other	markets.	Our	focus	
has	been,	and	will	continue	to	be,	on	our	
Core	events	and	this	is	reflected	in	the	
growth	experienced	across	our	Core	events	
in	the	year,	which	grew	at	a	much	faster	
rate	than	our	Non-Core	events.	Looking	
ahead	the	TAG	initiatives	are	also	having	
a	positive	impact,	with	deferred	income	
at	30	September	2017	of	£82.6m	(2016:	
£61.9m),	with	a	significant	proportion	of	
the	increase	coming	from	the	introduction	
of	our	new	onsite	rebooking	initiative.
The	Group	reported	losses	before	tax	of	
£3.2m	against	a	prior	year	loss	before	tax	
of	£4.1m.	This	was	after	including	one-off	
restructuring	costs	of	£5.0m	(2016:	£nil),	
£4.6m	of	which	were	incurred	as	part	of	
the	TAG	programme,	and	impairment	
charges	of	£14.3m	(2016:	£26.5m).
Headline	profit	before	tax	is	a	non-
statutory	measure	of	performance	
used	by	the	Group	as	it	better	reflects	
underlying	trading	performance.	After	
excluding	adjusting	items,	detailed	below,	
headline	profit	before	tax	was	£31.6m	
(2016:	£36.5m).	Included	within	headline	
profits	were	£2.8m	of	costs	associated	
with	the	TAG	programme,	such	as	the	
best	practice	teams	and	the	impact	of	
changes	to	the	sales	commission	structure.	
On	a	like-for-like	basis	headline	profit	
before	tax	has	grown	by	2%,	reversing	
the	trend	reported	in	recent	years.
Basic	and	diluted	earnings	per	share	were	
(3.1)p	(2016:	(3.6)p).	The	Group	achieved	
headline	diluted	earnings	per	share	of	
8.1p	(2016:	10.7p),	with	the	decrease	
largely	due	to	the	reduction	in	headline	
profits	in	the	year	and	the	increase	in	
the	Group’s	effective	tax	rate,	which	
is	discussed	in	more	detail	below.
Group	operating	cash	conversion	for	the	
year	was	134%	(2016:	112%).	The	significant	
increase	is	largely	as	a	result	of	the	onsite	
rebooking	initiative,	which	has	brought	
our	cash	inflows	forward,	and	also	from	an	
increase	in	forward	bookings	for	next	year’s	
events	attributable	to	an	upturn	in	trading,	
particularly	across	our	Core	events.	Net	
debt	at	the	year-end	has	reduced	to	£49.7m	
from	£59.1m	at	30	September	2016	as	a	
result	of	strong	cash	flows	from	operations.	
The	Group’s	£6.7m	cash	investment	in	the	
new	TAG	programme,	£10.0m	of	previously	
committed	acquisition	and	transaction	
costs	and	£8.7m	of	dividend	payments	to	
shareholders	have	been	funded	entirely	
through	cash	flows	from	operations.

Statement
continued
A	refinancing	of	the	Group’s	external	
debt	facility	was	completed	in	November	
2017	and	gives	the	Group	access	to	a	
new	£100m	facility	from	a	syndicate	of	
four	banks,	HSBC,	Barclays,	Citibank	and	
Commerzbank.	The	facility	amortises	by	
£10m	each	year	and	expires	in	November	
2021,	giving	us	certainty	over	funding	
through	the	life	of	the	TAG	programme.	
The	facility	has	more	favourable	pricing	
and	more	appropriate	covenants,	including	
a	leverage	ratio	which	is	now	assessed	
on	a	net	debt	to	EBITDA	basis,	replacing	
the	gross	debt	covenant	in	place	under	
the	previous	facility.	The	facility	is	also	
structured	to	allow	the	flexibility	we	
require	to	achieve	our	plans,	including	
larger	acquisition	baskets	and	more	
flexible	use	of	disposal	proceeds.
Trading summary
In	2017	the	Group	ran	234	events	(2016:	252).	The	decrease	is	primarily	attributable	to	
cancellations	of	smaller,	less	profitable	events.	A	detailed	analysis	of	volumes	and	revenues

Refer	to	the	‘Divisional	trading	summary’	section	for	commentary	on	each	operating	
segment.
Other	income	relates	primarily	to	rental	income	from	sub-leasing	unused	office	space.
Central	costs	include	all	costs	that	are	
not	allocated	to	the	Group’s	operating	
segments	when	headline	profit	before	tax	
is	reported	to	the	Senior	Operating	Board	
for	the	purposes	of	allocating	resource	and	
making	strategic	decisions.	These	include	
the	Group’s	corporate	overheads	and	
other	central	costs	that	are	included	within	
cost	of	sales.	The	corporate	overheads	
are	the	costs	of	running	the	head	office	
in	London	and	are	primarily	comprised	of	
the	staff	costs,	which	include	the	Group’s	
Executive	and	Non-executive	Directors,	
depreciation	of	the	Group’s	centrally	held	
assets,	office	rent	and	professional	fees.	
The	other	central	costs	included	within	
cost	of	sales	include	digital	marketing	costs	
that	are	not	event-specific,	but	span	the	
Group’s	portfolio	of	events.	The	increase	
in	central	costs	in	2017	follows	higher	
bonus	payments	in	the	year,	an	element	
of	which	is	based	on	the	achievement	of	
target	Group	results	for	the	financial	year.
Central	costs	in	2017	include	£1.3m	of	
TAG	costs	and	£1.4m	of	central	structure	
costs.	Of	the	£2.8m	of	costs	associated	
with	the	TAG	programme	that	have	been	
included	within	headline	results,	£1.3m	
do	not	directly	relate	to	the	reportable	
segments	and	have	been	recognised	
within	central	costs.	The	central	structure	
costs represent costs in London that 
were	primarily	incurred	prior	to	the	
launch	of	the	TAG	programme	to	ensure	
that	we	were	positioned	appropriately	
to	determine	the	Group’s	new	strategic	
direction	and	ultimately	to	implement	it	
successfully.	These	include	the	staff	costs	
and	recruitment	costs	of	the	new	Strategy	
Team	and	the	CFO,	to	the	extent	that	there	
was	no	comparable	cost	in	the	prior	year.
The	foreign	exchange	gain	represents	
the	retranslation	of	monetary	assets	and	
liabilities	held	in	our	subsidiary	companies	
that	are	denominated	in	currencies	
other	than	the	functional	currencies	
of	the	subsidiaries.	See	the	‘Foreign	
exchange’	section	for	further	details.
Net	finance	costs	relate	to	the	
interest	payable	on	our	external	
banking	facility	and	bank	fees,	net	of	
interest	income	for	the	period.
Headline results
In	addition	to	the	statutory	results,	
headline	results	are	presented,	which	are	
the	statutory	results	after	excluding	a	
number	of	adjusting	items,	as	the	Board	
consider	this	to	be	the	most	appropriate	
way	to	measure	the	Group’s	underlying	
performance.	In	addition	to	providing	
a	more	comparable	set	of	results	year-
on-year,	this	is	also	in	line	with	similar	
adjusted	measures	used	by	our	peer	
companies	and	therefore	facilitates	
comparison	across	the	industry.
With	the	exception	of	restructuring	
costs,	the	adjusting	items	presented	are	
consistent	with	those	presented	in	the	
previous	year.	The	restructuring	costs	
have	been	presented	separately	in	order	
to	report	what	the	Board	consider	to	
be	the	most	appropriate	measure	of	
underlying	performance	of	the	Group	
and	to	provide	additional	information	
on	the	scale	and	progress	of	the	
Group’s	transformation	programme.

Amortisation of acquired intangible assets
Amortisation	of	acquired	intangible	assets	relates	to	the	amortisation	charge	in	
respect	of	intangible	assets	acquired	through	business	combinations.	The	charge	has	
declined	in	the	year	as	a	result	of	a	number	of	our	historical	Russian	intangible	assets	
reaching	the	end	of	their	estimated	useful	lives,	offset	in	part	by	the	amortisation	on	
the	intangible	assets	recognised	on	completion	of	the	acquisition	of	Gehua	in	the	year.	
See	the	‘Portfolio	management’	section	for	further	details	on	the	Gehua	acquisition.
