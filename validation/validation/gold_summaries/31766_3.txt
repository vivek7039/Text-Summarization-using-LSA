 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 19
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I’m pleased to be writing this as 
we mark another year of continued 
strong growth, with a 33% increase 
in sales across all markets. 
We’ve delivered this while making 
substantial improvements to our 
infrastructure to unlock more growth. It’s 
no small achievement to push through 
fundamental changes behind the scenes 
while growing at pace in an increasingly 
crowded marketplace – and continuing to 
keep a laser focus on meeting customers’ 
needs. Our performance is a tremendous 
credit to the commitment and passion of 
everyone at ASOS. 
Strategic opportunities and 
challenges
The ASOS mission hasn’t changed: to be 
the world’s number one destination for 
fashion-loving 20-somethings.
We still see huge potential for ASOS in 
every market. 20-something fashion is 
global; and online penetration still has lots 
of room to grow. Our focus continues to 
be on finding ways in each market to give 
customers more of what they want, using 
technology and data to provide customers 
with a more personalised, convenient and 
reliable service, as Nick talks about in his 
operational review on page 20. We also 
believe that delivering Fashion with Integrity 
at scale will be a powerful – and essential 
– differentiator within our industry, and you 
can read about how we’re doing this on 
pages 36 to 46.
We’re very aware of the possibility of 
disruption, having disrupted retail from the 
outside ourselves. There are some sizeable 
operations with huge resources that are 
extremely interested in our market space. 
But we also believe there are opportunities 
within any new disruptive force. This 
makes it all the more important that we 
truly understand our business model, and 
particularly our purpose – why we’re here 
and how we’re different – something that 
we’ve done a lot of work on in 2017. 
 
Behind the scenes
The past year has seen some fundamental 
changes to our infrastructure, with 
developments like the opening of our 
second full-scale warehouse, Eurohub 2. 
We’ve also upgraded our systems to enable 
more international growth, and have 
brought our entire global Customer Care 
team into one large centre in the UK. 
Other initiatives in progress include the 
expansion of our London head office to 
accommodate our ever-growing team, as 
well as a two-year programme to overhaul 
our retail system to more efficiently deliver 
a better customer experience while 
scaling as we grow. Importantly, we’ve 
managed these large-scale transformational 
programmes without slowing our growth.
Our people and culture
We could do none of this without the 
passionate, committed and talented people 
at ASOS all working towards our goals and 
purpose. I’d like to thank them on behalf of 
the Board and our shareholders for all they 
do. We know that we’re asking people to 
raise their game as the business grows, and 
that this becomes more challenging each 
year. We’re extremely fortunate to have 
people who are engaged and energised 
by the challenge. And we work hard to 
maintain our unique and inclusive culture 
that encourages authenticity, bravery, 
creativity and fun. 
Board update
The Board’s focus is to ensure ASOS 
continues to lead the way in customer 
experience and that we’re prepared for 
the growth ahead. We exercise diligence 
so that our long-term investments – such 
as new systems and warehouse facilities – 
don’t affect the agility of the business and 
the experience we deliver. We’re also very 
aware that customers are becoming more 
conscious of how businesses use their data. 
With new European data regulations on the 
horizon, we’re making sure we put the data 
we collect to good use and manage risks 
while giving customers the transparency 
and control they expect from the businesses 
they engage with.
This year, for the first time, we conducted 
an external review of Board effectiveness 
(see the summary on page 54). We all 
must raise our levels of performance as the 
Company grows, and the Board is  
no exception.
Dividend strategy
The Board has again decided not to 
declare a dividend. We generate a 
significant return on invested capital, and 
we firmly believe the right thing for the 
business and our shareholders is to invest in 
the opportunities that lie ahead. 
Looking ahead
We are looking to the future with 
confidence and are excited about the 
opportunities that lie ahead. We will remain 
restless and totally focused on the evolving 
expectations of our customers. And we will 
do everything we can to strengthen and 
clearly communicate what makes ASOS 
different – for our exceptional employees, 
partners and millions of customers around 
the world.
