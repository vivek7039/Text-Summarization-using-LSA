STRATEGIC REPORT
STATEMENTS
Group strategy 
The Group’s “compounding” strategy 
is designed to generate strong growth 
in earnings and shareholder value 
over the business cycle, while building 
larger, broader-based businesses 
in the three Group Sectors of Life 
Sciences, Seals and Controls. 
The businesses target stable “GDP 
plus” underlying revenue growth over 
the business cycle with sustainable 
attractive margins and then convert 
the profit into strong free cash flow by 
tightly managing working capital and 
focused capital investments. The free 
cash flow generated then funds healthy 
growing dividends and selective value 
enhancing acquisitions which accelerate 
growth in revenues and profit to double-
digit levels. The strategy consistently 
delivers a return in excess of 20% 
pre-tax on total capital invested and 
steadily increasing shareholder value.
Business model and KPIs
Stable and resilient “GDP plus” underlying 
revenue growth is achieved through 
our focus on essential products and 
services funded by customers’ operating 
rather than capital budgets and supplied 
across a range of specialised industry 
segments. By supplying essential 
solutions, not just products, we build 
strong long term relationships with our 
customers and suppliers, which support 
sustainable and attractive margins. 
Finally, we encourage an entrepreneurial 
culture in our businesses through our 
decentralised management structure. 
These essential values ensure that 
decisions are made close to the customer 
and that the businesses are agile and 
responsive to changes in the market 
and the competitive environment.
The key performance indicators (“KPIs”) 
we use to measure the success of the 
business model relate to recurring 
income and stable underlying revenue 
growth, sustainable and attractive 
margins and organisational health. 
This year, underlying revenue growth, 
after adjusting for currency movements 
and acquisitions, has been a robust 7% 
with the growth rate strengthening in 
the second half of the year. Over five 
years, the average underlying revenue 
growth has been 5% p.a. which meets 
the Group’s target of “GDP plus” growth.
Adjusted operating margins improved 
this year by 10bps to 17.3% of revenue, 
as transactional currency pressures 
eased during the year in the Healthcare 
businesses and improved operating 
leverage with tight control of operating 
costs has offset other pressures on 
gross margins. Over five years the 
average adjusted operating margin 
has been ca. 18% against the Group’s 
medium term target of 18–19%.
The agility and responsiveness of the 
organisation is more difficult to measure 
directly, but non-financial KPIs can 
give an indication of the organisational 
health. The number of working days 
lost to sickness has consistently been 
only ca. 1% a year and over the last five 
years, the average length of service for all 
employees has been ca. 6.5 years (ca. 11 
years for the senior management cadre).

The Group’s strategy , 
consistently applied, delivers 
strong growth in earnings 
and shareholder value.

Chief Executive’s Review 07 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Financial performance
In 2017, the Group delivered strong 
double-digit growth in revenue and 
earnings with robust underlying 
growth, a modest net contribution 
from acquisitions and further 
benefiting from the strong tailwind 
from the depreciation in UK sterling.
The Group’s reported revenues 
increased by 18%, with currency 
movements increasing revenues by 
9% and acquisitions contributing a 
further 2% to the revenue growth, 
net of a small prior year disposal. 
On an underlying basis, after 
adjusting for acquisitions and for 
currency effects on translation, 
Group revenues increased by 7%. 
Group adjusted operating margins 
improved by 10bps to 17.3%, 
compared with 17.2% in the prior full 
year and the first half of the current 
year. Management gross margins have 
reduced overall by 60bps with margin 
pressures in several businesses from a 
combination of the impact on product 
costs from currency movements and 
increases in other margin support 
costs. These pressures have been 
partly mitigated by the stronger 
gross margins in recent acquisitions 
and transactional currency pressures 
in the Healthcare businesses have 
eased during the year. Operating 
costs as a percentage of revenue 
have reduced by 70bps with improved 
operating leverage from the 
increase in revenues and generally 
tight control of operating costs. 
Working capital as a percentage of 
revenue was managed down through 
the year to 15.0%, although the 
Group’s free cash flow reduced by 
6% to £55.7m, reflecting the absence 
of prior year proceeds from one-off 
property sales and the divestment 
of the Medivators business. 
Sector performance
In Life Sciences, underlying revenues 
increased by 4% after adjusting 
for currency movements, the 
acquisition of Abacus and the prior 
year disposal of the Medivators 
business. The Healthcare businesses 
benefited from stronger capital 
revenues as new technology was 
introduced and delayed projects 
were reactivated in the laboratory 
diagnostic sector. The Environmental 
businesses delivered steady growth in 
instrumentation sales and increasing 
service contract revenues. 
In Seals, underlying revenues 
increased by 4% after adjusting 
for currency movements and the 
acquisitions of PSP and Edco. In 
North America, the improving trend in 
industrial activity seen in the second 
quarter, following the US election, 
strengthened further as the year 
progressed. In the International Seals 
businesses, strong growth in the UK 
and Scandinavia was offset by more 
challenging market conditions in 
Switzerland, Russia and Australia. 
In Controls, underlying revenues 
increased by 14% after adjusting for 
currency movements and the prior 
year acquisitions of Cablecraft and 
Ascome. The Specialty Fasteners 
business increased revenues strongly, 
driven principally by a ramp-up in 
demand from customers in the Civil 
Aerospace sector. The Interconnect 
and Fluid Controls businesses also 
delivered good growth benefiting from 
increased project work and targeted 
investment in sales resources.
Acquisitions and disposals
Over the last three years, a total 
of ca. £90m has been invested in 
acquisitions which contributed ca. 
16% of 2017 Group revenues. 
During 2017, total acquisition spend 
was ca. £20m, of which ca. £15m 
was invested in the acquisition of 
Abacus, a long established supplier 
of diagnostics instrumentation and 
consumables to the Pathology and 
Life Sciences sectors in Australia and 
New Zealand. Abacus adds critical 
mass to our existing Healthcare 
businesses in the region and opens 
up new growth opportunities. 
In addition, two smaller bolt-on 
acquisitions were completed in the 
Seals Sector during the year – PSP 
in the US and Edco in the UK. After 
the year end, a small acquisition was 
completed in the Controls Sector 
of Coast Fabrication Inc. (“Coast”), 
a US specialty fastener distributor.
Our Year in Review
Growth strategy and KPIs
Overall growth is accelerated from 
underlying “GDP plus” levels to the 
corporate target of double-digit growth, 
through carefully selected, value 
enhancing acquisitions which fit the 
business model and offer entry into 
new but related strategic markets. 
Acquisitions are not made just to add 
revenue and profit, but rather to bring 
into the Group successful businesses 
which have growth potential, capable 
management and a good track record of 
profitable growth and cash generation. 
As part of our Acquire, Build, Grow 
strategy, we invest in the businesses 
post-acquisition to build a firm foundation 
to allow them to move to a new level of 
growth and improve operating margins. 
These acquisitions form a critical part 
of our Sector growth strategies and are 
designed to generate a pre-tax return 
on investment of at least 20% and 
hence support our Group objectives 
for return on total investment. 
Again we measure the success of the 
growth strategy with KPIs, the first of 
which is acquisition spend. To achieve the 
Group’s objective of strong double-digit 
growth, acquisition spend of at least £30m 
p.a. is targeted, though year on year spend 
will vary with the acquisition environment. 
This year, the Group invested ca. £20m 
in acquisitions, bringing the total over 
three years to ca. £90m. The acquisitions 
completed over the last three years have 
contributed ca. 16% of 2017 revenues. 
Strong cash flow funds our growth 
strategy (and supports healthy, growing 
dividends) and tight management of 
working capital maximises the conversion 
of profit to cash flow. This year, working 
capital has been managed down to 
a record low of 15.0% of revenue, 
generating free cash flow of £55.7m 
and representing a conversion rate of 
99% of adjusted post tax earnings. Over 
five years, the average working capital 
to revenue ratio has been 16–17% and 
average free cash flow has been £45m p.a. 
with an average conversion ratio of 98%.
The Group’s return on total investment 
measure is the pre-tax return on adjusted 
trading capital employed, excluding 
net cash, but including all goodwill and 
acquired intangible assets (“ROATCE”). 
This is used to measure the overall 
performance of the Group and very 
importantly, our success in creating value 
for shareholders through our acquisition 
programme. Over the last five years, 
ROATCE has comfortably exceeded the 
20% target and this year was 24.0%. 08 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Chief Executive’s Review

Building management 
strength
Essential values and culture
We encourage an entrepreneurial 
culture across our businesses, through 
a decentralised management structure. 
In specialised distribution businesses 
it is essential that decisions are made 
close to the customer and that the 
businesses are agile and responsive to 
changes in the market and competitive 
environment. The success of the 
Group is therefore built upon strong, 
self-standing management teams 
in the operating businesses who are 
committed to and rewarded according 
to the success of their businesses.
This culture is very attractive to 
managers who join the Group in 
acquired businesses and who are 
used to a similar culture in their 
privately owned businesses. 
Managing business clusters
We also recognise that there are 
significant synergy benefits which 
can be achieved through managing 
clusters of similar businesses. Typically 
these synergies come in the form 
of cross-selling and joint purchasing 
between the businesses and shared 
back office functions. There are 
also best practices which can be 
shared within the clusters in areas 
such as IT and digital capabilities.
We have therefore introduced small 
senior teams to manage the business 
clusters in each Sector, while being 
careful not to allow the build-up of 
heavy divisional structures with their 
associated costs and bureaucracy. 
This ensures that we gain the 
benefits of scale while retaining 
agility in the operating businesses.
These senior management teams 
are responsible for maximising the 
potential of their business clusters and 
also for identifying and progressing 
acquisition opportunities.
Executive Management Group
As the Group grows larger and 
becomes more broadly spread both 
geographically and operationally, it 
is important that we have in place a 
strong and broad based executive 
management team to drive the next 
stage of the Group’s growth strategy.
The Executive Management Group 
(“EMG”) was established in 2016, 
comprising the Executive Directors 
along with the executive managers who 
are responsible for the major business 
clusters and key Group functions. The 
EMG members are a combination of 
internally developed managers and 
experienced senior managers who 
have been recruited externally. 
The EMG provides the opportunity for its 
members to broaden their perspective 
of the Group’s activities in order to 
reinforce the key elements of the Group’s 
culture and to identify best practices 
which are transferable across the Group. 
The EMG meets quarterly through a 
combination of full group meetings 
in London and sub-group meetings 
held in the major business locations. 
The EMG provides the senior 
management bench strength to 
manage a growing and broadly spread 
Group while laying the groundwork for 
succession in key executive positions. 09 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Capital Markets Day
In February 2017, the Group hosted a 
Capital Markets Day (“CMD”) in London, 
exactly five years to the day after the 
previous CMD held in February 2012.
There were four key objectives for 
the day:
1. Five-year track record – to show the 
Group’s progress over the last five 
years in executing its strategy and 
delivering strong growth in earnings 
and shareholder value.
2. Resilience and sustainable margins 
– to demonstrate the resilience of the 
Group’s businesses and the high 
barriers to entry which protect the 
Group’s stable and attractive margins.
3. Runway for growth – to give 
confidence in the substantial further 
“runway for growth” over the next five 
years, through a combination of stable 
underlying growth and value 
enhancing acquisitions.
4. Senior management bench strength 
– to introduce the strong and 
experienced senior management team 
which is in place to drive the next 
phase of the Group’s development.
The first objective was achieved in 
an introductory presentation and 
animation video which summarised the 
development of the Group over the five 
years, with strong double-digit growth 
in adjusted EPS, TSR and dividends and 
an increase in market capitalisation 
from ca. £400m to ca. £1.2bn.
The other three objectives were 
achieved in break-out sessions for each 
of the three Sectors, where the EMG 
members presented the key features 
and resilient characteristics of their 
businesses and demonstrated key 
products. They also described the key 
elements of competitive advantage 
and barriers to entry which support 
the attractive margins. Finally, they 
detailed the substantial runway for 
growth in each business in terms of 
new product and market opportunities, 
geographic expansion and acquisitions.
The various presentations and video material delivered at the CMD are on the Diploma PLC 
website in the Investors section under the heading “Diploma PLC Investor Day 2017”.
