The Group provides a comprehensive 
range of merchandise and services 
for customers and their pets. It is the 
combination of our specialist retail offer, 
veterinary practices and grooming 
salons, all within a single pet-focused 
environment, that represents a uniquely 
attractive offer to our customers. 
Retail
Our merchandise offer is provided from 
our retail store network and website. 
Within our stores, well-trained colleagues 
provide detailed advice on areas such  
as pet nutrition and the set-up of home 
aquaria. Investment in our omnichannel 
capabilities provides additional 
convenience for customers. 
Services
We provide veterinary services through 
our first opinion network of Joint Venture 
practices, and our specialist referral 
centres. Our first opinion practices are 
operated mainly under the Vets4Pets 
brand and are situated in stores and  
in standalone locations. Our referral 
centres provide high level, specialist 
services to vets working in our own and 
in other first opinion practices. Grooming 
services are provided primarily from 
salons within our retail stores.
