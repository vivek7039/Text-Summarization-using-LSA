 Strategic Report
Chairman’s statement
Good progress 
has been 
made against 
our Vision 
2020 strategy
I am honoured and delighted to be the 
newly appointed Chairman of Kier.
Group revenue
1, 2
 for the year ended 30 June 2017 increased by 
5% to £4.27bn (2016: £4.08bn) and underlying operating profit
1
 
increased by 3% to £146m (2016: £141m). Underlying profit 
before tax
1
at £126m (2016: £116m) represented a 8% increase. 
Reported profit before tax of £26m (2016: a loss of £35m) 
includes non-underlying items, predominantly relating to the 
disposal of Mouchel Consulting and the portfolio simplification 
programme. The underlying basic earnings per share
1
 from 
continuing operations of 106.8 pence (2016: 99.5 pence) has 
increased by 7%. The Group’s net debt
4
 at 30 June 2017 was 
£110m (2016: £99m), at the lower end of expectations, 
following strong working capital management during the year. 
This performance has maintained a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 
less than 1x, in line with our Vision 2020 target.
After the year end, the Group completed its acquisition of 
McNicholas Limited, which strengthens the Group’s presence in 
the utilities and infrastructure services market. This acquisition 
builds on Kier’s strategy to maintain its leading positions in 
chosen markets. It is a highly complementary addition to our 
current utilities business and enhances our presence in the power, 
rail and telecoms markets.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a full year dividend for the year ended 
30 June 2017 of 67.5 pence per share (2016: 64.5 pence per 
share), up 5%, reflecting the Board’s confidence in the Group’s 
prospects and intention to increase dividend cover towards 2x by 
2020. Subject to shareholder approval, the final dividend will be 
paid on 1 December 2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 29 September 2017. As an alternative to 
the cash dividend, shareholders will be offered the option to 
participate in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP).
The macro environment
UK Government policy continues to support investment in upgrading 
the UK’s infrastructure, driving economic growth both nationally and 
regionally. The devolution of funding and decision-making, both 
locally and regionally, is now starting to gather pace with the 
establishment of mayoral authorities and increased collaboration 
between local authorities. Despite the uncertainties of Brexit, we 
have a strong position in a number of key sectors and our breadth 
of capabilities positions us well to address our clients’ needs.

On 30 August 2017, Phil White CBE stepped down from the Board 
as Chairman. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Phil for 
his contribution to the Group over the past ten years in which he 
has overseen the growth and change within the Company. I know 
many Kier employees have benefited from his counsel. Personally, 
I would like to thank Phil for his support during my induction and 
transition into my new role, which I took up on 1 September 2017. 
I look forward to working with the Board on the Group’s next stage 
of development.
Results
I am pleased to present the results for the year ended 
30 June 2017. This year was an important one for Kier as we 
continued to make good progress against our strategy, Vision 
2020. Over the last five years, Kier has tripled in size resulting 
in significant change in the business as new processes and 
systems are put in place and its portfolio of capabilities has 
changed. This year, we have substantially completed our two-year 
portfolio simplification programme focused on streamlining and 
simplifying the Group’s operations, allowing investment in the core 
businesses for the future. The strength of Kier lies in its teams 
and their ability to provide clients with a depth and breadth of 
capabilities across a number of specialist fields positioning us 
as the ideal partner to collaborate with.
12 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Outlook
Kier has successfully grown its reputation as a company that can 
consistently deliver. Its success in the marketplace to date has 
shown it is trusted by its clients and supply chain.
Our underlying performance for the year was good. Having 
simplified our portfolio, the Group is more focused and able to 
pursue growth ambitions in our three core markets; building, 
infrastructure and housing, which now represent 90% of the 
Group’s revenue and profit. We continue to invest in the business 
to improve our operational efficiency, providing a robust platform 
on which to take advantage of the strong long-term fundamentals 
in these core markets. 
Our Construction and Services order books of £9.5bn, together 
with our c.£2bn property development and residential pipelines, 
provide good long-term visibility of our future work. This visibility, 
coupled with our healthy balance sheet, provides us with 
confidence in achieving our Vision 2020 strategic targets.

Corporate governance
Kier remains committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. The Board and its committees play a key role in 
guiding the company and setting the tone for how the business 
operates. I believe it is of paramount importance that we have the 
right skills set on the Board to steer the Group strategy for the 
long term. The Board is also supportive of the Group’s ongoing 
focus on effective risk management, corporate responsibility and 
the value our operations bring to regional economic growth.
On 1 July 2016, Constance Baroudel joined the Board and 
became the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, replacing 
Amanda Mellor who left the Board after last year’s annual general 
meeting. Constance brings significant financial experience and a 
detailed understanding of strategy in light of her present role at 
First Group.
Full details of our corporate governance can be found on pages 
58 to 104.
Our people
The safety and, very importantly, the wellbeing of our people 
remain a priority and I am pleased to report that during this year 
we once again reduced our accident incidence rate (AIR) and rolled 
out campaigns to employees to raise awareness of good health 
and wellbeing.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our employees who 
are so committed to making Kier the company it is. Since joining, 
I have already felt the pride and professionalism that our teams 
display in their delivery to our clients.
