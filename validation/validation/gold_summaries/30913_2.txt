Group snapshot
The world of energy is changing and, 
with our chosen businesses, distinctive 
propositions and current capabilities, 
Centrica is well placed to deliver for its 
customers, shareholders and for society. 
We aim to be a good corporate citizen 
and an employer of choice. 
Our areas of focus for growth are Energy 
Supply, Services, Connected Home, 
Distributed Energy & Power, Energy 
Marketing & Trading. We also have a 
material Exploration & Production division.
We supply energy and services to over 25 
million customer accounts mainly in the UK, 
Ireland and North America through strong 
brands such as British Gas, Direct Energy 
and Bord Gáis Energy, all supported by 
around 15,000 engineers and technicians. 
We are focused on delivering high levels of 
customer service, engagement and loyalty.
Technology is increasingly important in 
the delivery of energy and services to our 
customers. We are developing innovative 
products, offers and solutions, underpinned 
by investment in technology. In 2017 we 
announced the creation of a new venture 
‘Centrica Innovations’ to identify, incubate 
and accelerate new technologies and 
innovations.
At the end of 2017 , phase one of Centrica’s 
repositioning was complete. We have 
simplified our business and portfolio. 
We now have just three divisions – 
Centrica Consumer, Centrica Business 
and Exploration & Production. Our asset 
portfolio has been materially repositioned.
We delivered our £750 million per annum 
cost efficiency programme three years early 
and met our net debt targets. We are seeing 
encouraging signs of progress in our 
customer-facing businesses. In our next 
phase to 2020, we will further shift 
investment towards those businesses and 
focus on performance delivery, specifically 
growing gross margin and driving a further 
£500 million per annum of cost efficiencies, 
while maintaining financial discipline.
