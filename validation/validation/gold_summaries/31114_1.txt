 Chief Executive’s report
Overview
CentralNic continued to develop as an internet services
business of substantial scale that is highly cash generative and
built around a recurring revenue model. There are significant
opportunities available for growth in the market, of which the
Company continues to take advantage.
During the year, the Company’s acquisition strategy continued
to target companies with a strong existing customer base and
a high proportion of recurring revenue, with a particular focus
on businesses with exposure to high-growth and emerging
markets. Building on the previous acquisitions of Internet.BS
in the Bahamas (2014: US$7.5 million) and Instra Group in
Australia and New Zealand (2016: AU$38.0 million), the Group
acquired SK-NIC in December 2017 for a maximum cash
consideration of €25.7 million. SK-NIC is the manager of the
exclusive country code top-level domain for Slovakia, .sk and
realises the majority of its earnings through a recurring revenue
stream from a substantial embedded customer base.
SK-NIC offers significant growth potential, achievable
through the combination of the strongest domain product
in the Slovak market and CentralNic’s specialist technical,
sales and marketing expertise. CentralNic migrated .sk
onto its proprietary software in 2017 and strengthened the
local management team to ensure that .sk achieves global
best practice as a foundation for that nation’s growing
digital economy.
Since its acquisition, the integration of SK-NIC has progressed
according to plan. The .sk operation has been migrated
onto a customised version of the CentralNic registry software
in the Slovak language, and the management team in
Bratislava has been strengthened with the addition of a Head
of Communications. Tasks that were outsourced to the
vendors as part of the transition plan are being successfully
migrated in-house. Trading since the acquisition was
completed is in line with expectations.
In July, CentralNic was recognised as the best performing
company in the Infrastructure Services category of the
Quoted25 awards. This annual award, created by Megabuyte,
acknowledges the top 25 performing technology companies
in the mid-tier of the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market.
Results
CentralNic achieved revenues of £24.3 million, a 10%
increase over 2016 revenues of £22.1 million, and Adjusted
EBITDA of £6.6 million, a 20% increase on 2016’s Adjusted
EBITDA of £5.5 million. The profit after tax reflected a 7%
increase at £1.02m (2016: £0.96m).
The Group continues to improve the quality of its earnings,
increasing recurring revenues to 84% of total revenues. The
Group’s global revenues also continued to grow, with over 37%
of total revenues coming from outside the UK, North America,
and Europe, reflecting a focus on high-growth emerging markets.

Building on previous acquisitions of Internet.BS
in the Bahamas and Instra Group in Australia
and New Zealand, CentralNic has continued to
successfully execute its acquisition strategy.
In 2017, CentralNic acquired SK-NIC, the

domain for Slovakia, We will continue to grow
the company both organically and through
further acquisitions and remain entirely focused
on expanding our global footprint in the domain
and web services industry.

At the end of the year, the Group had cash balances of
£10.9 million (2016: £9.9 million) with net debt (excluding
prepaid costs) of £7.2m (2016: net cash £7.3m). During the
year, CentralNic entered into a new facility agreement with
Silicon Valley Bank, which enabled the group to acquire
SK-NIC and optimise its capital structure and gain access
to funding for growth opportunities.
Operational review
Wholesale (Registry Services)
Wholesale revenues grew 48% to £4.7 million (2016: £3.2
million) and the Company maintained its position as a leading
wholesaler of domain names using new gTLDs, with 22.6%
market share at the end of 2017. CentralNic’s Wholesale
Division is the only registry services provider to count six of
the top 20 new gTLDs as clients (from around 1,200
launched in total).
CentralNic has continued to be the world leader in winning
new clients in its Wholesale Division, including a contract to
manage 14 Top Level Domains from OpenRegistry, a
subsidiary of KeyDrive Group. CentralNic manages 104
domain extensions (gTLDs, ccTLDs and SLDs) overall, ranking
as an impressive 5th globally. In September 2017, the Group
renegotiated its exclusive wholesaler contract with .XYZ.com,
the owner of the world’s leading new gTLD, .xyz, on a fixed fee
basis until May 2032 with the potential to increase fees based
on the number of .xyz domains managed.
Retail
Retail revenues grew 9% to £15.6 million in 2017 (2016:
£14.3 million). The retail business serves three of the main
customer groups for domain names and supporting services;
small businesses, resellers and domain investment
professionals. One of the Retail Division’s objectives during
2017 was to broaden the number of supporting products it
can provide to its existing customer base. During the year,
it added IT security products, web and email hosting,
website construction and analysis products to its portfolio
available to its existing and future customer base.
The Retail Division increased the number of domain extensions
it provides and has continued to optimise the costs associated
with domain name provision and therefore increased
profitability. This was in part achieved through an outsource
arrangement with the leading global reseller platform RRPProxy,
a subsidiary of the KeyDrive Group. Considerable
management and technical resource has been dedicated to
this project which, when completed, will result in CentralNic’s
retailers obtaining all their domains from a single supplier, rather
than supporting hundreds of supplier relationships.
Enterprise
Revenues from CentralNic’s Enterprise Division decreased
slightly in 2017, down to £4.1 million (2016: £4.6 million),
reflecting the Group’s strategy to decrease the proportion of
its overall revenues obtained through one-off premium domain
name sales. The recurring revenue components of CentralNic’s
enterprise business continue to grow. With CentralNic’s
assistance, a number of corporate clients completed the
ICANN delegation process in 2017 and have begun to prepare
their “DotBrand” Top Level Domains for use. Other corporate
and government clients continue to licence CentralNic software
and many also use the Group’s fee-based support services to
distribute domains, develop and implement their own policies
and to market and manage their operations in-house.
CentralNic’s premium domain name trading business
performed well with revenues of £3.0 million achieved, reduced
from £3.7 million the previous year. In line with the Group’s
strategy to focus on increasing its revenues in the recurring
category, premium domain name sales will be a decreasing
proportion of revenues and contribution going forward.
Acquisitions: progressing CentralNic’s strategy
Moving forward, CentralNic will continue to identify
acquisitions that will add scale and new market leading
technology platforms to serve its customers as well as
creating opportunities for savings by eliminating duplication
in costs. The Group has established a robust foundation for
future growth, is able to leverage a suite of world-class
software and services, has a large and experienced
management team and significant staff resources able to
support customers around the world.
Infrastructure for growth
People
During 2017, CentralNic made significant additions to its
Board and management team to extend even further its ability
to execute our acquisitions-led growth strategy. In July,
Don Baladasan joined the Board as Chief Financial Officer,
bringing significant public company acquisition and integration
experience. At senior management level the Company had
already recruited Group Commercial Director Stuart Fuller
and Group Marketing Director Andy Churley, from NetNames
(formerly GroupNBT), to reinforce and build sales and
marketing operations. In May 2017, Sarah Ryan was
appointed Corporate Development Director to support the
Board in its M&A activities. Sarah was previously Director of
International M&A for LexisNexis and Thomson Financial
and brings significant transaction experience including in the
Middle East, Russia, China, India, South Africa and Europe.
Current market trends
In December 2017, there were approximately 332.4 million
domain names under management globally. This represents a
growth of 3.1m domain names (0.9%) over 2016. Generic Top
Level Domains (gTLDs e.g. .com and .net) had a combined
total of approximately 146 million domain names (2.9% growth)
and all country code Top Level Domains (e.g. .sk) accounted
for approximately 146 million domain names (2.4% growth).
The top 20 new gTLDs (of which CentralNic manages six)
account for 65% of all registrations in this category. Chief Executive’s report continued
Post year end
In January 2018, the Group replenished its premium domain
trading inventory for a total consideration of £2.5 million, as a
step towards ensuring that the company retains the capacity
to continue to trade profitably in premium domain names as
required. CentralNic also continued winning new clients,
including the .ooo TLD, owned by billion-dollar Mumbai-listed
tech company, Infibeam.
In March 2018, due to industry speculation, CentralNic
announced that it was in advanced negotiations to merge with
a leading operator of reseller and corporate platforms in the
domain industry, KeyDrive S.A., a Luxembourg company.
The combination of the two businesses has strong strategic
logic and economies of scale and represents an opportunity
to create a group with competitive technology platforms
delivering significant recurring revenues for every major
customer type within the industry. Discussions are ongoing
at the time of publication.
Outlook
Current trading is in line with expectations as the Group
continues to grow both organically and through further
acquisitions and remains entirely focused on expanding its
global footprint in the domain and web services industry.
New products and services are added continually to service
customers. For example, the group plans to offer online
security and brand protection services to its corporate clients.
Across all its business segments, new customer acquisition
remains a priority for the Group.
Finally, we will continue to make earnings enhancing
acquisitions to achieve further scale, additional capabilities
and greater economies of scale.
