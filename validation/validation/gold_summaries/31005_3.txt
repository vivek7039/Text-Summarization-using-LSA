Results 
Following consecutive years of strong profits growth in 2015 and 
2016, I am pleased to report that Synthomer has made further 
progress in 2017. Consistent with our expectations, the improved 
Underlying profitability of the Group has been delivered, with 
incremental profits from our focused M&A activity in 2016 and 2017 
and continued organic growth from our investment in our Europe 
and North America (ENA) segment more than compensating for the 
reduced, but stable, Nitrile latex margins in our Asia and Rest of the 
World (ROW) segment. Volumes were higher by 9% to 1,443.8ktes 
(2016: 1,324.9ktes) with the increase reflecting a combination of 
underlying growth and additional volumes from Oxo Belgium 
(Speciality Additives), which was fully integrated during 2017. 
Acquisitions helped Group revenue to increase by 42% to a record 
£1,480.2m (2016: £1,045.7m), further supported by higher average 
raw material prices and favourable currency translation. 
Underlying profit before tax increased from £122.2m to £130.0m, an 
increase of 6.4% and 3.0% on a constant currency basis. The rise in 
Underlying profit before tax reflects underlying volume and margin 
growth, the contribution made by Speciality Additives and the 
depreciation in Sterling. IFRS profit before tax decreased from 
£136.7m to £86.4m mainly as a result of one-off items of income 
in 2016 including the profits on the Malaysian land sales (£33.2m). 
Our balance sheet is strong with net debt at 1.0 times EBITDA which 
allows us significant flexibility to pursue our growth strategy through 
capital investment and strategic acquisitions.
Neil Johnson
Chairman Ongoing capital investment programme 
We continue to focus on organic growth and see significant 
opportunities to drive growth from our existing businesses. To 
strengthen our platform for future growth, we initiated a step change 
in our capital investment programme in 2016 with significant plant 
expansions at our ARW Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) Nitrile latex plant, 
and our ENA Worms (Germany) Dispersions plant. The Board is 
pleased to see that these investment programmes are progressing 
safely, in line with plans, and will be commissioned and brought up 
to normal operating levels later in 2018 and early 2019 respectively. 
We have made further capital commitments to expand our 
capabilities in Sant’Albano (Italy), Marl (Germany) and Oulu (Finland) 
and these investments will also come online in late 2018 and early 
2019. As well as growth capital investment, the Group has invested 
in sustenance and SHE related capital expenditure to ensure we are 
both operating our plants safely and in accordance with evolving 
legislation.
M&A and integration activity
Acquisitions also remain a key component of our growth strategy. 
During the year, we announced two further bolt-ons: Speciality 
Additives, which became part of the Group in March 2017, and 
BASF Pischelsdorf which was agreed in September 2017 and 
completed in January 2018. These bolt-on acquisitions significantly 
complement our existing business. Speciality Additives has strong 
market positions which we will leverage into our existing coatings 
customer base. The Pischelsdorf site expands our SBR asset and 
customer base, and will provide further options for our network 
optimisation in an SBR market characterised by over-capacity. 
Speciality Additives was successfully integrated into the Group 
during the year and we are executing the well planned integration 
of BASF Pischelsdorf. Following the acquisition of the Pischelsdorf 
site, Synthomer has secured its position as market leader in 
European aqueous polymers, another milestone for our business. 
Our active search continues for a transformational speciality 
chemical company acquisition and we considered a number of 
options in 2017. However, we have stringent criteria and we will 
continue to be disciplined in our approach in terms of quality, 
strategic fit, opportunity and price. 
Following our acquisition of the PAC (Dispersions) business in 2016, 
integration is substantially complete. The actions that we have taken 
during 2017 mean that we will not only deliver the $12m run rate 
of synergies at the end of 2018 but are looking to deliver a further 
$2m in 2019. As part of this integration, we disposed of one plant 
in Leuna (Germany) and are engaged in restructuring our Ribécourt 
site (France).
Governance and Board
We were once again in full compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code throughout 2017. Our 2017 AGM resolutions 
received overwhelming support and we were particularly pleased 
to achieve greater than 99% of votes in favour of our new 
remuneration policy.
The Board composition remained unchanged until the end of the 
year when Jinya Chen retired after five years’ service. I would like to 
thank Jinya for his commitment and contribution over that period. 
The Nomination Committee has initiated a search for a replacement 
independent non-executive director in order to bring the Board 
composition back into balance.
An externally facilitated evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
was carried out in 2017 with the feedback recognising good 
progress in the ongoing programme to improve Board effectiveness. 
As we enter 2018, I believe the Board is well positioned to adapt to 
the changes in the corporate governance landscape envisaged by 
the new Code proposals currently under consultation and likely to 
be effective in 2019.
Our people
We now have approximately 2,900 employees in the Group, spread 
across 29 manufacturing sites and offices, with 40 joining as part 
of the Speciality Additives acquisition. As a Board, we have visited 
recently acquired sites over the last year and are delighted to see 
how our new colleagues have adapted to our values and culture, 
as well as bringing new skills into the Group.
The Group has reported record Underlying profitability in a 
challenging and demanding market place and the Board and 
Executive team recognise the contribution made by all employees. 
Our drive for growth remains unchanged and on behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank each and every employee for their 
commitment this year.
Safety, health and environment (SHE)
The nature of our industry involves significant hazards and as 
such our high safety, health and environmental standards are 
fundamental to what we do across the business. We are pleased 
to report that we have recorded our lowest ever level of recordable 
injuries (lower than 2016 by 56%). 
We are committed to reducing our recordable injuries to zero and 
as part of our continuous improvement drive to achieve this we made 
the embedding of the SHE Principles and 10 Golden Rules, launched 
in 2016, a priority for 2017. There was a focus on systems linked to 
permit to work and management of change with the aim of eliminating 
work being carried out in a way or in an environment which could 
result in a safety incident. New indicators were developed to track 
and analyse progress, with specific focus on live monitoring of 
permit controlled work and control of high hazard activities. 
Notwithstanding the considerable improvement delivered in 2017, 
we are not complacent, and remain absolutely resolute in our 
campaign for continuous and sustainable improvement.
Dividend
The Board has proposed an increase to the final ordinary dividend 
per share to 8.5p (2016: 7.8p), resulting in a total dividend per share 
for the year of 12.2p (2016: 11.3p). This is in line with the Group’s 
dividend policy of a dividend covered 2.5 times by Underlying 
earnings per share. The final dividend per share is subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 
2018 and will be payable on 6 July 2018 to those shareholders 
registered at the close of business on 8 June 2018.
The Board is committed to generating attractive growth for 
shareholders through investing in the Group’s significant organic 
and inorganic growth plans to secure its future progress and the 
Capital Management Policy of the Group remains unchanged. The 
Board periodically assesses the balance sheet strength in light of 
these growth plans, and will consider returning excess capital to 
shareholders, if appropriate.
Outlook
Looking forward, whilst acknowledging the ongoing challenges 
in our Nitrile latex and constructions and coatings Dispersions 
markets, we are confident of making further solid progress in 2018, 
underpinned by underlying growth in both segments, and from 
integrating our recent acquisitions. 
With our significant organic investment in new capacity being 
commissioned in late 2018, we remain confident in continuing 
to deliver growth in profitability and driving further value for 
shareholders in future years.
