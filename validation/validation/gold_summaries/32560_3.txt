 A year of 
encouraging 
progress
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“The transformative 
changes we have 
made over the past 
few years have 
started to deliver 
results, as we benefit 
from our new-found 
trading agility.”
Andrew Higginson
Chairman
This year saw the first benefits come 
through from the material changes to 
people, processes and systems we have 
made to the business. After a challenging 
first half, the Board is pleased with the 
trading momentum seen in the second 
half, with the Group outperforming 
the wider market over the key peak 
trading period. 
I continue to be impressed by the sheer 
quantum of change that has occurred 
in the business over the past few years. 
Whilst the process of transformation 
has not been without its challenges, 
the business is now in a much stronger 
position, with a far more sustainable 
model for the future.
In September we gained our full FCA 
authorisation. This was an important 
milestone for the Group and marked 
the successful end to a lengthy and 
thorough process. 
This coming year will be another 
important one for the Group. We remain 
on track to complete the final stages of 
our systems programme by Summer 2018 
although, as has been the case throughout 
the programme, our first priority is risk 
minimisation, not speed of delivery at 
any cost.

We continue to innovate and improve our 
ways of working to ensure we continually 
put the customer at the centre of 
everything we do. We have a strong 
business, with a loyal customer base and 
good growth prospects. 
Dividend 
Whilst continuing to invest in the business 
to secure our future growth, we also 
continue to recognise the importance 
of cash returns to our shareholders. 
We intend to pay a final dividend of 8.56p 
this year, taking the total dividend to 
14.23p – unchanged from last year.
Board composition 
In October I was pleased to welcome 
Richard Moross to the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. Richard is the 
founder and CEO of Moo.com and brings 
significant expertise in digital retailing 
and technology. 
Following her appointment to the board of 
Newell Brands Inc in the USA, Fiona Laird 
has indicated her intention to step down 
from the Board as soon as a suitable 
replacement has been found. External 
consultants have been engaged and an 
announcement will be made in due course.
After 23 years’ service, Ivan Fallon has 
indicated his intention to retire and he will 
therefore not be seeking re-election to the 
Board at this year’s AGM. The Board and I 
would like to thank Ivan for his outstanding 
contribution over many years and to wish 
him well for the future.
Outlook 
The past year has seen unprecedented 
changes in the macro-economic landscape 
which remains challenging for retail. This 
manifests itself in our cost prices through 
inflation, particularly in fuel, our product 
costs as a result of exchange rate changes, 
and the disposable income of our 
customers. Against this backdrop we 
remain vigilant over our core costs and 
efficiencies.

was granted unconditionally.
Corporate Governance
The Board is committed to developing and applying high standards of corporate 
governance both in the management of its business and in its accountability to 
stakeholders as a whole.
Consumers globally continue to move 
their spending online, and our online 
capabilities and lack of a large store 
estate mean that we are at an advantage 
here. We must not become complacent, 
however, but instead we must continually 
innovate and improve our capabilities 
and customer offering. 
I would like to express my thanks to 
all stakeholders in the business, and in 
particular our brilliant colleagues, for 
all their passion, commitment and hard 
work throughout the year.
