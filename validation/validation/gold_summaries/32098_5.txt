 Introduction
The SUSE Product Portfolio represented 22.0% of the total 
Group revenue in FY17 (2016: pro-forma CCY revenue 18.0%).
SUSE has continued with the mandate to deliver “accelerated, 
sustainable and proﬁtable revenue growth” and has continued 
to invest in the business to support this vision. FY17 has been 
another successful year for SUSE with growth in revenue, 
Annual Contract Value (“ACV”), Total Contract Value (“TCV”) 
and Underlying Adjusted EBITDA. 
SUSE created additional capacity with the objective of sustainable proﬁtable 
growth, by expanding the SUSE headcount across all of the key disciplines 
and SUSE also completed two technology led acquisitions during the ﬁscal 
year. Closer alignment of critical support functions continued during the year, 
as we aligned SUSE Services and SUSE Renewals to have dedicated leaders 
reporting into SUSE Sales leadership. In FY17, we continued to strengthen our 
partner eco system, with continued investment in broadening and deepening 
the partnership with Alliances, OEM, two tier distributors, value add resellers, 
cloud service providers and system integrators. We continue with our concerted 
effort to broaden the ISV partnership and accredit SUSE offerings on critical 
and relevant business applications. SUSE continues to rely on sustained 
growing contribution from these strategic partnerships for its overall success.
Technology acquisitions during the year:
During the year, SUSE acquired OpenStack IaaS and Cloud Foundry based 
PaaS technology from HPE together with a workforce of 105 Engineers. This 
will strengthen SUSE’s existing OpenStack Cloud (IaaS) offering and also 
SUSE’s Cloud Foundry PaaS offering when brought to market. The acquisition 
also enables SUSE to broaden its Original Equipment Maintenance (“OEM”) 
partnership with HPE to now include SUSE’s OpenStack Infrastructure as a 
Service (“IaaS”), Enterprise Linux and Software Deﬁned Storage solutions as 
well as fast track provision of more comprehensive offerings in the OpenStack 
IaaS and Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (“PaaS”) space to all of its IHVs 
and alliance partners.
SUSE also acquired distributed storage management technology from 
OpenATTIC together with eight Engineers, which was a group within IT Novum 
GmBH, a German registered company. This will enable SUSE to strengthen 
SUSE Enterprise Storage and its open source software deﬁned distributed 
storage offering by adding advanced storage management capabilities to 
the solution.
We continued to extend SUSE’s presence and contribution in key Open Source 
projects and relevant industry groups both in support of strengthening our 
contribution to Open Source innovation and development efforts as well as in 
support of our partner and enterprise customer relationships.

Open Source Software
SUSE products and solutions are developed from Open Source technologies 
and brought to market with an Open Source business model. Open Source 
software source code is made available in the public domain under a number 
of different licensing models (such as GPL) which fosters collaboration and 
rapid innovation by developers around the world working as private individuals, 
for Enterprise customers and from within many of the industry’s largest 
IT companies.
SUSE actively utilizes and engages in a wide range of Open Source projects 
and related industry initiatives where we work together with communities and 
partners to drive the new innovation and create meaningful industry standards. 
These projects include the Linux Foundation, OpenStack, Ceph, Cloud 
Foundry, openHPC, OPNFV, Open Mainframe Project, Open Container 
Initiative, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and many more.

Enterprise Linux
Linux is one of the ﬁrst and most successful Open Source software projects in 
the industry and has now become a well-established choice in the enterprise 
operating system market but also in numerous other use cases including 
mobile devices, Internet of Things (“IoT”), cloud computing, big data analytics 
and more. All of the industry’s major software-deﬁned infrastructure 
innovations are being developed on and for the Linux operating system.
SUSE was the industry’s ﬁrst provider of an enterprise distribution of the Linux 
operating system and are the preferred choice on platforms such as IBM z 
Systems and for workloads such as SAP applications and SAP HANA.
Some of the key drivers behind the continued demand for enterprise Linux 
solutions such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server include:
 – UNIX to Linux migrations – the movement of workloads from proprietary 
UNIX operating systems on specialized hardware to Linux on industry 
standard hardware platforms but also IBM z Systems and Power.
 – Data Center consolidation and virtualization – maximizing hardware 
investments by running multiple operating system instances on the same 
physical server.
 – Cloud computing infrastructure – the most prevalent OS for the cloud 
infrastructure and also widely used as the OS for the workloads running 
on the private and public clouds. 
 – High Performance Computing – the world’s top supercomputing clusters 
and the growing use of high performance computing systems leverage the 
ﬂexibility and performance of Linux operating systems.
 – Software-deﬁned innovations – Linux has become the de-facto standard 
OS for the industry’s infrastructure software innovations from IoT, Big Data 
analytics and software-deﬁned storage, IaaS and private cloud, Containers 
and orchestration, PaaS, NFV and software-deﬁned networking.
OpenStack Private Cloud
OpenStack has become the industry’s clear Open Source standard for IaaS 
cloud with active engagement from dozens of leading IT companies and 
enterprises. This technology provides a highly ﬂexible alternative to proprietary 
solutions which both commercial companies and end-customer enterprises 
can directly engage with through the OpenStack project in addition to utilizing 
distributions such as SUSE OpenStack Cloud.
SUSE was a founding platinum member of the OpenStack Foundation and has 
held the Foundation’s board Chair position since its creation. SUSE OpenStack 
Cloud’s streamlined installation capabilities, unattended upgrades, high 
availability features and support for all leading hyper-visors makes it an ideal 
choice for enterprise private cloud.
Some of the key drivers creating demand for OpenStack private cloud solutions 
such as SUSE OpenStack Cloud include:
 – Data center evolution to Software Deﬁned Infrastructure (“SDI”) –  
the next step beyond data center consolidation and virtualization is to 
embrace the ﬂexibility and agility of cloud capabilities such as self-service, 
direct integration with software-deﬁned storage and networking.
 – On demand services and business agility – in a world that expects instant 
access to everything, the ability to rapidly stand up new products and 
services for both internal and external customers is essential to competing 
effectively.
 – Cost and value – traditional solutions lag in innovation and don’t bring the 
economic scalability in both CAPEX and OPEX costs needed to support 
modern business models the way Open Source solutions can.
Software-deﬁned Storage
Enterprises across all industry segments and sizes are struggling to control 
and manage the impact of explosive data growth at the very time that 
effectively using information is rapidly becoming the key to competitive 
differentiation. With more data to store in increasingly large and complex 
formats for longer periods of time, traditional storage solutions are not able 
to adequately address all the user cases and needs.
SUSE Storage, built on Ceph technology, is a unique solution with resilient 
self-managing and self-healing capabilities combined with ﬂexibility to 
dynamically utilize both existing hardware as well as today’s latest industry 
standard hardware components.
Some of the key drivers creating demand for Open Source software-deﬁned 
storage solutions like SUSE Storage include:
 – Massive data growth – more data volume, complex, large data formats and 
requirements to keep data for longer periods of time for analytics and 
regulatory compliance.
 – Need for ﬂexibility and elasticity – replacing traditional static storage 
appliances when more capacity is needed is simply not tenable in many 
cases. Enterprises require the ability to dynamically add capacity using 
industry standard hardware.
 – Cost and value – traditional storage solutions are often not economically 
scalable when faced with the massive data growth, larger complex data 
formats and need for longer term storage.

continued Systems Management
For mid-sized or larger computing environments, comprehensive systems 
management is a critical factor that many enterprises still struggle to address. 
Considering the complexity of multiple hardware platforms, a wide variety of 
infrastructure technologies and the increasing use of combinations of on 
premise, hosted and public cloud resources, the business challenges are 
signiﬁcant as are the potential beneﬁts.
SUSE Manager is designed with a deep understanding of today’s Linux-based, 
Open Source enterprise infrastructure technologies whether those are used 
on premise, virtualized or in a cloud deployment. SUSE Manager is a powerful 
tool for integrated management and orchestrations of system provisioning, 
monitoring, conﬁguration management, automated patching – all designed to 
support the most complex enterprise and supercomputing scale deployments.
The key drivers behind the demand for systems management solutions like 
SUSE Manager include:
 – Managing complexity – growth in systems (physical, virtual and cloud) and 
new infrastructure technologies like IaaS, Containers, PaaS creates needs 
for new management methodologies (Dev/Ops) and new tooling 
to manage effectively.
 – Maintaining security, Service Level Agreements (“SLAs”) and uptime – to 
be most effective, systems and servers, wherever they are deployed, must 
be secure and able to meet stringent SLAs with maximum uptime.
 – Reducing Operating Expenses (“OPEX”) – the days of manual systems 
management processes are past for any enterprise that needs to also 
innovate and compete. Automation is essential to free up resources and 
control systems management OPEX. 
 – Meeting regulatory compliance requirements – to stay compliant, 
enterprises must have comprehensive monitoring, conﬁguration 
management controls and remediation capabilities in place.
Application Containers
Organizations can improve business agility by adopting a software-deﬁned 
infrastructure approach to support containerization of their applications. 
Container innovation helps to develop and deploy next-generation, cloud native 
container-based applications and to progressively migrate traditional and 
existing apps.
SUSE CaaS Platform, is a development and hosting platform for container-based 
applications and services. The solution lets IT operations and developers 
provision, manage and scale container-based applications and services. The 
solutions consist of three key components – orchestration using Kubernetes, 
a purpose-built operating system (SUSE MicroOS) for microservices and 
containers, and conﬁguration capabilities.
Some of the key drivers creating demand for Application Containers and 
solutions like SUSE CaaS Platform include:
 – Reduced time to market using out-of-the-box container platform 
capabilities that enable customers to implement container orchestration 
using production grade Kubernetes, deploy resilient container services, 
maximize portability, and develop in a trusted computing environment;
 – Increased operational efﬁciency with automation of deployment 
management tasks and full application lifecycle support of containers; and
 – Faster and more automated application releases across different 
infrastructure. Enablement of DevOps for improved application lifecycle 
management. Bridging developers and operations using a single, uniﬁed 
container platform that helps save development and operations time. 
Deployment of microservices and coexistence of conﬁguration and code.
SUSE – Key Performance Metrics
SUSE provides technical support together with rights to updates, patches 
and security ﬁxes for its Open Source solutions on a subscription basis with 
revenues being recognized rateably over the period of the contract. The key 
metrics are Revenue, TCV and ACV of the TCV. The ACV represents the value 
of the ﬁrst 12 months of each contract reported as TCV.

International and Asia Paciﬁc & Japan regions have shown strong growth 
in revenue of 28.0% and 28.9% respectively. Growth in these regions was 
derived across all routes to markets together with securing new business with 
large enterprise accounts. We are pleased to note that the change to specializing 
and aligning the ﬁeld sales and marketing resources to SUSE in the Asia 
Paciﬁc & Japan has enabled setting the foundation for sustained proﬁtable 
revenue growth. 
Revenue growth in North America was lower than expected, with some of the 
larger transactions not closing within the ﬁscal year as expected. We expect 
to see continuing growth in FY18. 
TCV and ACV
TCV represents the gross billings for the year of $339.1m, an increase of 
1 1.6% from the pro-forma CCY for FY16 of $303.8m. The weighted average 
contract duration marginally reduced to 28 months in FY17 from 29 months 
in FY16. The ‘in ﬁscal year yield’ from TCV to revenue remained broadly the 
same at 34% in FY17 as it was in FY16. ‘In ﬁscal year yield’ represents the 
proportion of TCV generated in the ﬁscal year that can be recognized as 
Subscription Fee Revenue (“SFR”) in the same ﬁscal year. As the weighted 
average contract duration reduces, we would generally expect to get a higher 
‘in ﬁscal year yield’. Net new subscription TCV increased by 12.4% year-on-
year and renewal subscriptions TCV grew by 10.4% year-on-year. Net new 
subscription contracts are derived from sale of subscriptions to new logo 
customers and existing customers expanding footprint of existing product 
portfolio or subscribing to new product solutions. 
ACV measures the ﬁrst 12 months duration equivalent of TCV. ACV grew to 
$220.1m, an increase of 15.7% from the pro-forma CCY for FY16 of $190.3m. 
ACV removes the impact of multi-year TCV and is a cleaner KPI on the 
performance of the business. Where subscription term is less than 12 months, 
all of the subscription TCV billing is included in the ACV measure.

continued North America had below expected performance on TCV and ACV, declining 
by 14.6% and 4.8% respectively. Timing of some of the larger enterprise 
multi-year renewals together with deferral of some of the larger enterprise 
deals contributed to this decline. 
International achieved strong TCV and ACV growth at 33.8% and 31.9% 
respectively. Good solid performance across all countries in the region 
together with closing of some large enterprise deals contributed to this 
outstanding growth.
Asia Paciﬁc & Japan had very strong performance in TCV and ACV, growing 
by 31.1% and 37.6% respectively. We continue to have strong performance in 
China and Japan, and are also continuing to win new accounts in some of the 
other key markets in the region. The region continues to get good traction and 
growing revenue streams on local OEM relationships and also by leveraging 
the global agreements we have in place with key independent hardware 
vendors and cloud service providers.

Deferred revenue
We continue to have year on year steady growth in the deferred revenue 
balance. At 30 April 2017 SUSE’s total deferred revenue balance was 
$374.3m (2016: $326.8m), an increase of $47.5m (14.5%) year-on-year. 
56.4% of this increase in deferred revenue balance is recognizable revenue 
in the next 12 months and 82.6% recognizable in 24 months.
Headcount
At the end of April 2016, direct headcount in SUSE was 641 increasing to 
936 by 30 April 2017, a net increase of 295 heads (46.0%) in the ﬁscal year, 
which includes the additional heads joining from the OpenATTIC acquisition 
in November 2016 and from the acquisition of OpenStack and Cloud Foundry 
assets in March 2017. The increased investment in direct headcount is 
primarily in Engineering, Product Management, Sales, Marketing, Product 
Marketing and Alliances to address the opportunity we see in the market for 
SUSE’s existing offerings together with new opportunities in OpenStack IaaS, 
Software Deﬁned Distributed Storage based on Ceph technology and with 
public cloud service providers. 
In addition to the direct headcount, the SUSE portfolio received in the year 
ended 30 April 2017 support from SUSE dedicated employees, who are 
organizationally aligned in the shared service functions of the Group. Most 
prominently in Renewal Sales, Consulting, Customer Care, Sales Operations 
and other corporate operations functions. These add up to approximately 
201 full-time equivalents (“FTEs”), which brings the total SUSE dedicated 
headcount supporting the SUSE business and customers to approximately 
1,137 FTEs at the end of April 2017.

CEO Review – SUSE Product Portfolio 
continued Recruitment and on-boarding
The successful execution of the growth charter and investment plan for SUSE 
depends on the ability to ﬁll the new, incremental positions in a timely fashion 
and thus ramping up our capacity in key areas of the business. 
To build on the momentum of this year we need to improve our ability to grow 
our team. To this end changes have been initiated, that will have a positive 
impact on the recruitment and on-boarding of new employees to the SUSE 
business as well as ongoing, quality HR management of the enlarged team 
that shall beneﬁt from those changes. This includes hiring of a VP HR 
dedicated to the SUSE business in Q3 FY17, closer alignment of shared 
HR service functions with the SUSE business and organization as well as 
deploying additional HR management and recruitment employees paired 
with an increase of third party recruitment spending.
Outlook “Sustainable, Proﬁtable Revenue Growth”
We will continue to invest in building out the organization to ensure continuing 
improvements in execution capacity across all major business functions and
