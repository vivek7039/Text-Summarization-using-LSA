 08 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
“In our 225th anniversary year, 
I am pleased to report another 
year of good performance from 
both of our businesses.”
 
 Stephen Clarke
 Group Chief Executive
In our 225th anniversary year , I am pleased to report 
another year of good performance from both of our 
businesses. Travel continues to perform well with 
strong revenue growth across all channels and, for 
the first time, revenue in Travel has overtaken High 
Street with Travel now the largest part of the Group 
in both revenue and profit. Internationally , we have 
made further good progress in growing our revenue 
and profit and have won some significant tenders in 
the year . In our High Street business, our strategy 
of optimising the return from our space and assets 
continues to produce strong cash generation and 
sustainable profits.
It is important to recognise that this performance 
would not be possible without the support of all of 
our colleagues across the entire business. Their 
hard work ensures that we are able to achieve these 
results and I am sincerely grateful for their support 
and valued contribution.
GROUP OVERVIEW
The distinct strategies of our Travel and High Street 
businesses have been successful in driving profit growth 
and creating shareholder value, underpinned by our 
disciplined approach to cash generation and capital allocation.
In Travel, we aim to deliver high levels of revenue and profit 
growth and good cash generation. We seek to achieve this 
by driving like-for-like revenue growth in existing stores 
through improved execution and service; investment in store 
environments and layouts; a forensic store by store focus on 
retail space and category management; winning new space 
and developing new formats in the UK. 
In International Travel, we aim to expand profitably by winning 
new tenders and retaining existing space; building critical mass 
in our emerging hubs; driving like-for-like sales in existing 
stores; and by executing the same retail and operational 
disciplines and insights as we do in the UK.
In High Street, we aim to deliver sustainable profit growth 
and, as we do in Travel, good cash generation in a constantly 
changing consumer environment. We seek to do this by adopting 
a forensic store by store focus on retail space management to 
optimise the returns from our core categories; driving margin 
growth through category mix management; reducing our cost 
base to reflect our changing sales profile and productivity 
initiatives; and creating value from our assets, including third 
party partnerships that enhance the customer offer .
Group profit from trading operations
1
 increased by six per cent 
on the prior year to £158m and the Group generated Group profit 
before tax of £140m (2016: £131m), an increase of seven per cent 
on the prior year . 
Total Group revenue was up two per cent at £1,234m 
(2016: £1,212m) with like-for-like
2
 revenue flat compared to last 
year . Travel revenue was up nine per cent on 2016 at £624m, of 
which three per cent relates to forex benefits, and up four per 
cent on a like-for-like basis, reflecting investment in our key 
initiatives and improved passenger numbers. Compared to last 
year , High Street revenue was down five per cent at £610m and 
down four per cent on a like-for-like basis.
Chief Executive’s review Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 09
Travel delivered a strong revenue performance across all 
channels, with trading profit
1
 increasing by ten per cent to £96m, 
including £9m (2016: £7m) from our growing International 
business. Travel now represents over 60 per cent of Group profit 
from trading operations. We continue to invest in the business 
and we opened 15 new units in the UK during the year , taking us 
to a total of 582 units in the UK. 
During the year we won a further 41 units in our International 
business, including a significant win in Changi Airport in 
Singapore in the first half of the year , and our first stores in Italy 
in the second half, making a total of 273 international units won, 
of which 233 are open. 
High Street delivered another good performance matching 
a particularly strong profit performance from last year . 
As expected, trading profit
1
 was £62m. We saw a good gross 
margin performance and costs were tightly controlled. 
Cost savings of £12m were delivered in the year . An additional 
£9m of cost savings have been identified over the next three 
years making a total of £18m, of which £9m are planned for 
2017/18.
Diluted earnings per share increased by ten per cent to 103.6p 
(2016: 93.9p). This reflects the increase in profit and a lower 
basic weighted average number of shares in issue following the 
share buyback.
The Group remains highly cash generative and has a 
strong balance sheet. Net funds were £4m at 31 August 
2017 (2016: £7m), with a Group free cash flow
3
 of £105m 
(2016: £108m). The Group has a committed revolving credit 
working capital facility of £140m through to December 2021. 
We completed £41m of the share buyback announced on 
13 October 2016 and on 12 October 2017 we announced a further 
return of cash to shareholders of up to £50m through a rolling 
on-market share buyback programme.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 33.6p per share, a 
ten per cent increase on last year , giving a total dividend per 
ordinary share of 48.2p, a ten per cent increase on the prior year . 
The proposed increase in final dividend reflects our progressive 
dividend policy , the Board’s confidence in the future prospects 
of the Group and the strong cash generative nature of the 
business. The annual dividend has now increased every year 
since demerger from 11.8p in 2007 to 48.2p for 2017.
Both the Travel and High Street businesses are cash generative 
and we allocate our capital efficiently: investing in the business 
and new opportunities where we can achieve an attractive return 
ahead of our cost of capital (capital expenditure in the year was 
£48m), and making appropriate acquisitions whilst consistently 
growing dividends and returning cash to shareholders as part of 
our long-term strategy to create value for shareholders. 
Since our 2007 financial year , including the share buyback 
announced on 12 October 2017 and the proposed final dividend, 
we will have returned over £900m of cash to shareholders, 
increased the dividend each year and reduced our issued share 
capital by 40 per cent.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW 2016/17
During the year , Travel delivered a strong performance with 
trading profit
1
 up ten per cent to £96m. Full year total revenue 
was up nine per cent, which includes three per cent from forex 
benefits from our growing International business. Like-for-like 
revenue was up four per cent on a constant currency basis. 
Second half like-for-like revenue was up four per cent. 
We saw a strong revenue performance across all our key 
channels as a result of an improvement in passenger numbers 
and our initiatives in managing space, ranges and customer 
service. In air , total revenue was up seven per cent with like-for-
like revenue up six per cent; in rail, total revenue was up one 
per cent with like-for-like revenue also up one per cent; and in 
hospitals, total revenue was up six per cent with like-for-like 
revenue up five per cent. Gross margin increased by 100 bps 
during the year , driven by mix.
Whilst the increase in passenger numbers will be an important 
driver of growth, we are well placed to take advantage of the 
structural growth opportunities in our markets by: 
i.  focusing in our existing stores on improved execution and 
customer service; investment in store layouts; space and 
category management
ii.  developing new formats and opening new space in the UK; and
iii. expanding profitably overseas
Travel – UK
Retail space in Travel is often very constrained, it varies 
substantially by channel and location and is expensive. We seek 
to maximise the return from every square metre of this space 
through our detailed analysis of the space and category 
elasticities of each square metre of display space. This, along 
with our operational capabilities to make space changes three 
or four times a year even in our busiest stores, means we are 
able to respond to the changes in our customers’ needs, growth 
opportunities and adapt to seasonal variations. This process 
has, over the years, led to a significant evolution of our formats 
and ranges. During the year , we added to our digital ranges, 
introducing brands such as Apple, while also opening our first 
standalone ‘Tech Express’ unit in Southampton Airport. We also 
further improved our food offer by re-launching our sandwich 
and salad ranges and extended our healthy eating ranges.
We have continued to invest to drive improved customer service. 
With around 100,000 transactions in a peak week in some of our 
busiest stores, maintaining availability and customer throughput 
is critical. For peak trading this year we invested in additional 
labour for replenishment and fitted additional staffed tills as part 
of our Customer First initiative. 
During the year , we have invested in store layouts and store 
environment, as well as developing new formats that position 
us well for the future. One area of particular focus is our large 
airport format where our experience and analysis shows that 
we can deliver superior average transaction value and sales 
per passenger from larger store footprints. Larger stores 
enable improved customer circulation which drives customer 
conversion. Our first UK store showcasing a new design is due 
to open in Gatwick Airport South Terminal in November with a 
further store of a similar design due to open in Stansted Airport 
this year .

 “ During the year, we won  
41 new units including  
the significant tender  
win at Changi Airport  
in Singapore.”
“Looking ahead, we anticipate 
opening around 15 new units 
in total in the UK in each of 
the next three years.”
During the year , we won 41 new units including the significant 
tender win at Changi Airport in Singapore and, in the second 
half, seven units in Italy , including four at Rome Fiumicino 
Airport and two in Rome Ciampino Airport. Our first unit in 
Changi Airport is due to open in November 2017 with the 
remaining nine units opening during the first half of 2018. 
Four of the units in Rome are now open. In addition to the 23 
units won in the first half we won a further 18 new units in the 
second half, including the seven units in Italy and further units in 
Malta, Oman, India, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Of the units we have won approximately 50 per cent are 
franchised, 10 per cent joint venture and 40 per cent directly run. 
We will continue to use these three economic models flexibly in 
order to create value and win new business.
We are now present in 45 airports and 25 countries outside of 
the UK with 62 units open in Europe, 84 in the Middle East and 
India and 87 in Asia Pacific.
As at 31 August 2017 the Travel business operated from 
815 units, including motorway service area franchise units. 
Nine UK units were closed in the year , primarily due to landlord 
redevelopment. Excluding franchise units, Travel occupies 0.6m 
square feet.
In rail, we have created a new format for smaller regional rail 
stations which combines the traditional WHSmith format with a 
coffee offer . We have opened our first store which is trading well. 
This new format gives us opportunities to open stores in smaller 
stations in the rail network. In addition, following the successful 
opening of our standalone bookshop in Euston Station earlier in 
the year , we will open a further two new bookshops in the first 
half of the current financial year . These dedicated bookshops 
provide an enhanced customer experience with a unique look 
and feel and have been well received by customers, publishers 
and landlords. We now have 11 bookshops open in air and rail. 
Our hospital business is an important channel and we continue 
to invest here. During the second half of the financial year we 
developed and began trialling a new format within the WHSmith 
footprint that also includes an M&S Food to Go range, with 
an emphasis on healthy eating, and a WHSmith Coffee House 
counter . We are pleased with the two trial stores we have opened 
and customer feedback has been positive. During the year , we 
opened 15 units in the UK, including three in air , five in rail and 
six in hospitals, including three M&S Simply Food units. We now 
have a total of 18 M&S Simply Food units open.
Looking ahead, we anticipate opening around 15 new units in 
total in the UK in each of the next three years across all three 
of our channels, while at the same time driving sales per 
passenger in existing stores through improvements to customer 
offer and active space and margin mix management. 
International
We have built a successful Travel business based on the 
different operating models applied in each channel. Our active 
space management and our focus on providing a compelling 
offer to customers and to landlords enables us to win and 
retain business.
We continue to be successful in exporting this model overseas 
where the WHSmith brand is well received and we have 
demonstrated we can deliver improved performance and add 
value relative to the previous incumbent. 
Our International business is growing rapidly. We have now won 
273 units and opened 233. However , our share of the global 
news, books and convenience (NBC) travel market is still 
very small and we see opportunities to grow using our three 
economic models of directly-run, joint venture and franchise. 
Total revenue for the year was £108m (2016: £79m), up 37 per 
cent versus the previous year . Approximately 17 per cent of this 
increase relates to forex benefits. Like-for-like revenue was up 
six per cent on a constant currency basis. Trading profit
1
 for the 
year was £9m, an increase of £2m on the previous year .  12 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
PERFORMANCE
Review of operations:
High Street
PERFORMANCE REVIEW 2016/17
High Street delivered a good performance in the year in line 
with our expectations, matching a particularly strong profit 
performance from last year with trading profit
1
 flat at £62m 
(2016: £62m).
High Street total revenue was down five per cent and down four 
per cent on a like-for-like basis. Gross margin improved by 
around 110 bps, through rebalancing the mix of our business, 
better buying and markdown management.
In High Street, we aim to deliver sustainable profit growth 
and good cash generation in a constantly changing 
consumer environment. 
As we do with our Travel business, we consider retail space as a 
strategic asset and we utilise our space to maximise profitability 
in the current year in ways that are sustainable for future years. 
We have extensive and detailed space and range elasticity data 
for every store, built up over many years and we utilise our 
space to maximise the return on every metre drop in every store. 
We also create value through improving margins, reducing costs 
and driving third party income opportunities. 
Nearly all our stores are located in the best retail locations 
in the catchments in which we operate. This, and the huge 
variability in the size and shape of our stores, continues to give 
us opportunities to reconfigure our space to deliver margin 
mix benefits and efficiencies in the store operating model. 
During the year space changes have included further extending 
our Stationery ranges and providing more, better quality space in 
store to this category. 
We have conducted a number of trials to explore opportunities 
to further improve Stationery in our larger stores. These trials 
have ranged from lower cost initiatives that deliver key benefits, 
to additional space with new features, such as a dedicated 
pen shop and digital area, through to a complete store 
refurbishment, as we have done in Reading. 
Our strategy to build on our market leading position in 
Stationery remains unchanged. Stationery remains an attractive 
category for us with good economics and growth potential. 
Our in-house design capabilities for product and packaging; 
the quality , breadth and depth of our ranges; our ability to 
source competitively through our Far East sourcing office; and 
our promotional offers and scale mean we can differentiate 
ourselves in this category. 
During the year , Stationery has continued to be the main 
beneficiary of space with more stores benefitting from 
additional space towards the front of store and further range 
improvements. This additional space, combined with our range 
development initiatives drove good like-for-like revenue growth 
over the Christmas period (in categories such as calendars, 
single Christmas cards, wrap, diaries and decorations), and at 
‘back to school’. 
In Books, the General Retail Market remains fairly stable 
however the quality of publishing is still the biggest driver of 
market performance. Ebooks continue to decline across the 
market. During the first half, spoof humour books were a key 
driver of revenue while revenue from ‘colour therapy’ titles 
reduced significantly versus last year . In the second half, we 
annualised good publishing from 2016 including Harry Potter and 
The Cursed Child.

We continue to focus on areas of strength and the net 
profitability from this category. For example, spoof humour titles 
over Christmas and our book clubs where we continue to drive 
good results. The Richard and Judy Book Club remains the 
UK’s biggest book club and we are now in the second year of 
our successful Zoella book club targeting young adult readers. 
In September 2017, we launched a new Kids book club fronted 
by Tom Fletcher . We also see opportunities to improve the 
efficiency of our books operating model both in store and in the 
supply chain, reducing stock levels and increasing productivity. 
The newspaper and magazine market continues to be 
challenging but we held our market share supported by the re-
launch of our bookazine ranges. 
Driving efficiencies remains a core part of our strategy and 
we focus on all areas of cost in the business. We continue 
to deliver savings as part of our cost efficiency programme 
whilst adjusting our variable costs to sales. During the year 
we achieved cost savings of £12m. These savings come from 
right across the business, including rent savings at lease 
renewal, a more efficient store operating model through greater 
use of technology and contract renegotiations. Over the next 
three years, the leases on 250 stores expire giving us further 
opportunities to renegotiate rent to reduce our occupation costs. 
An additional £9m of cost savings have been identified over 
the next three years making a total of £18m of which £9m are 
planned for 2017/18. 
Post Offices continue to be an important area of investment. 
We now have 166 Post Offices open within our High Street stores 
of which 133 are franchises and 33 are run by Post Office Ltd 
under a concession agreement. During the year , we opened 
58 Post Offices from the deal we announced in April 2016. 
Customer feedback continues to be positive with customers 
commenting on the modern layout and environment as well as 
extended opening hours. The contract for all 166 Post Offices 
runs to 2026. The Post Offices further cement our position in the 
heart of the communities in which we operate. 
Funkypigeon.com performed well over the key seasons in 
the year . Mobile continues to be the main and growing source 
of traffic to the site and our investment in web development 
reflects this. During the second half, in line with our plan, we 
successfully opened a new 36,000 square foot fulfilment centre 
having reached capacity in the original site which opened in 
2011. This future proofing gives us scope to develop our gifting 
offer further and bring the majority of our fulfilment in-house.
As at 31 August 2017, the High Street business operated 
from 611 stores
2
 (2016: 612), which occupy 2.8m square feet 
(2016: 2.8m square feet). Three stores were closed in the year .
OUTLOOK
The distinct strategies for each of our businesses continue to 
deliver a good performance. We see further opportunities for 
growth in Travel in both the UK and overseas. Most airports 
are forecasting increases in passenger numbers although 
the forecasts remain variable by location. In addition, we will 
continue to invest in our stores and service levels and open 
new space. Outside of the UK we have won 273 units and 
our International business is profitable and growing fast. 
Our High Street strategy remains unchanged. We see further 
opportunities to grow our margin and reduce our cost base and 
we will continue to focus on driving returns from our existing 
space with our forensic approach to space management. 
Looking to the year ahead, while the economic environment 
remains uncertain we are well positioned for the year ahead and 
beyond. We will continue to drive both businesses, each with 
their distinct strategies, to maximise the contribution from both 
in order to deliver value for shareholders.

GROUP REVENUE
Total Group revenue was up two per cent at £1,234m and flat on 
a like-for-like basis. In Travel, total revenue was up nine per cent 
with like-for-like revenue up four per cent reflecting investment 
in our key initiatives and improved passenger numbers. For the 
first time, revenue in Travel has overtaken High Street and Travel 
is now the largest part of the Group in both revenue and profit. 
As expected, in High Street, total revenue was down five per cent 
with like-for-like revenue down four per cent. 
In the first half, Travel like-for-like revenue was up five per cent 
and up four per cent in the second half. In High Street, first half 
like-for-like revenue was down three per cent, and down four 
per cent in the second half.

Stationery like-for-like revenue was up three per cent in the

from the prior year which included JK Rowling’s Harry Potter and 
The Cursed Child. News and Impulse like-for-like revenue was 
up one per cent. We continue to see good growth in our impulse 
and Food to Go ranges. During the year we launched our new 
‘Munch’ range and extended the offer with healthier snacks and 
ready to eat convenience lines including fruit and protein pots.
Books and News and Impulse saw an increase in gross margin 
compared to last year and Stationery was slightly lower than last 
year reflecting mix and strong sales of digital ranges in Travel.

TAXATION
The effective tax rate was 17 per cent (2016:17 per cent), 
reflecting the lower statutory rate combined with the agreement 
with the tax authorities of open items from prior years. In the 
current financial year , we expect the effective tax rate to be 
around 18 per cent. The exact tax rate achieved will depend 
on the underlying profitability of the Group and agreeing 
outstanding tax assessments with the tax authorities.
In the year ended 31 August 2017, WHSmith contributed £255m 
in taxes, both paid and collected for the UK government. The key 
taxes paid by the Group were business rates, UK corporation 
tax and employers’ national insurance incurred in employing 
our 14,000 people. Other taxes incurred include environmental 
levies and customs duties. The main taxes the Group collects for 
the government are the sales taxes charged to its customers on 
their purchases and employee payroll related taxes.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Diluted earnings per share was 103.6p (2016: 93.9p), an increase 
of ten per cent. This reflects the increase in profit and the lower 
basic weighted average number of shares in issue following the 
share buyback.
DIVIDENDS
The Board has a progressive dividend policy and expects that, 
over time, dividends would be broadly covered twice by earnings 
calculated on a normalised tax basis.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 33.6p per ordinary 
share, an increase of ten per cent on the prior year , giving a total 
dividend per ordinary share of 48.2p, a ten per cent increase on 
the prior year . This increase on the prior year , together with the 
return of cash to shareholders announced on 12 October 2017, 
reflects the continuing cash generative nature of the Group 
and the Board’s confidence in its future prospects. Subject to 
shareholder approval, the dividend will be paid on 1 February 
2018 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 
12 January 2018. The final dividend will be paid gross.
 
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW
As at 31 August 2017, the Group had net assets of £187m 
(2016: £168m). The increase in net assets reflects the cash 
generation of the business, the return of cash to shareholders 
and investments in fixed assets.
CASH FLOW
The Group generated £105m (2016: £108m) of free cash flow. 
The cash generative nature of both the Travel and High Street 
businesses is one of the strengths of the Group.

Cash outflows from working capital were £7m which reflects our 
new store opening programme and timing. Payments relating to 
employers payroll tax resulting from the exercise of share based 
awards were £2m compared to £2m last year . Net corporation 
tax paid on trading profits was £25m, compared to £23m 
last year . 
Capital expenditure was £48m in the year and was £6m higher 
than the prior year due to the investment in Post Offices and 
the store operating model. Capex includes new stores in Travel 
in the UK and International, further investment in the store 
operating model, IT and our existing stores, and further format 
trials in Travel and High Street. 
This year , we expect capex to also be around £48m. 
Going forward after this year , we expect capex to be around 
£45m per annum although this will depend on the number of 
new stores we open.

In addition to the £105m of free cash flow generated in the 
year , the Group has seen a net cash outflow of £62m in relation 
to non-trading operations. This includes £50m of dividend 
payments, £3m pension funding and net purchase of our own 
shares for employee share schemes of £9m. 
In total we returned £41m to shareholders through an on-
market buyback of which £40m had been cash settled by 
31 August 2017. A further buyback of up to £50m was announced 
on 12 October 2017.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE)
ROCE for the Group after capitalising operating leases is 25 per 
cent (2016: 27 per cent) with Travel at 29 per cent (2016: 36 per 
cent) and High Street at 23 per cent (2016: 22 per cent).

5
  Return on capital employed after capitalised net operating leases is calculated as the 
adjusted trading profit as a percentage of operating assets after capitalising operating 
leases. Adjusted trading profit is stated after adding back the annual net rent and 
charging depreciation on the value of capitalised leases. The value of capitalised 
operating leases is based on the net present value of future rent commitments.
For the prior year , comparable ROCE was 80 per cent (Travel 116 
per cent and High Street 54 per cent).

PENSIONS 
The latest actuarial revaluation of the main defined benefit 
pension scheme, the WHSmith Pension Trust, was at 31 March 
2017 at which point the deficit was £11m (31 March 2014 
actuarial revaluation deficit of £24m). The Group has agreed 
a revised annual funding schedule with the Trustees from 
September 2017 for the next six years of just under £3m, a 
reduction of approximately £0.5m. This includes the deficit 
recovery contributions and other running costs. During the year 
ended 31 August 2017, the Group made a contribution of £3m to 
the scheme.
The scheme has been closed to new members since 1996 and 
closed to defined benefit service accrual since 2007. The Liability 
Driven Investment (LDI) policy adopted by the scheme continues 
to perform well with around 85 per cent of the inflation and 
interest rate risks hedged.
As at 31 August 2017, the Group has an IFRIC 14 minimum 
funding requirement in respect of the WHSmith Pension Trust 
of £4m (2016: £5m) and an associated deferred tax asset of 
£1m (2016: £1m) based on the latest schedule of contributions 
agreed with the Trustees. As at 31 August 2017, the scheme 
had an IAS 19(R) surplus of £269m (2016: surplus of £164m) 
which the Group has continued not to recognise. There is an 
actuarial deficit due to the different assumptions and calculation 
methodologies used compared to those under IAS 19(R).
The IAS 19(R) pension deficit on the relatively small UNS defined 
benefit pension scheme was £2m (2016: £2m).
OPERATING LEASES
The Group’s stores are held mainly under operating leases that 
are not capitalised and therefore are not included as debt for 
accounting purposes. The High Street leases are on standard 
‘institutional’ lease terms, subject to five year upwards-only rent 
reviews. The Travel stores operate mainly through turnover-
related leases, usually with minimum rent guarantees, and 
generally varying in length from five to ten years.
The business has an annual minimum net rental commitment 
of £182m (2016: £159m) (net of £1m of external rent receivable 
(2016: £2m)). The total future rental commitment at the balance 
sheet date amounted to £841m (2016: £769m) with the leases 
having an average life of five years.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Group has contingent liabilities relating to reversionary 
property leases. Any such contingent liability which crystallises 
will be apportioned between the Group and Connect Group PLC 
(formerly Smiths News PLC) in the ratio 65:35 pursuant to the 
terms of the Demerger Agreement (provided that the Connect 
Group PLC liability is limited to £5m in any 12 month period). 
We have estimated the Group’s 65 per cent share of the future 
cumulative contingent rental commitment at approximately  
£3m (2016: £3m).
