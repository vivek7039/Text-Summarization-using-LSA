 HEALTH AND SAFETY (H&S)
Avon is committed to safeguarding the health 
and safety of its employees and contractors. All 
employees are encouraged to take an active role 
in ensuring that our working environment is a safe 
place to work and visit by actively reporting all 
safety observations, being involved in safety audits, 
assessments and regular training sessions.
Over the year, monthly global H&S meetings are 
held where information, knowledge and ideas are 
shared to implement best practice across our sites 
and create positive safety attitudes.
Our management teams put considerable focus 
on potential hazard reporting, to ensure the 
appropriate action is taken before they can cause 
an incident or an accident. These actions are key 
to ensuring our facilities are safe places in which 
to work.
ENVIRONMENT
We are committed to minimising the impact of our 
operations on the environment and encourage 
all employees to think about ways of modifying 
their behaviour.
At the start of each year we set environmental 
improvement goals. Each site has delivered 
a number of improvements, for example the 
replacement of overhead lighting with LEDs at 
our Melksham site. 
Each facility participates in recycling paper, metal, 
plastic, cardboard and used products, and continues 
to focus on minimising energy consumption. 
We have experienced no external environmental 
incidents or concerns throughout the 2017 financial 
year at any of our locations.
The electricity, gas and water used at our UK sites is 
monitored on a weekly basis to spot peaks in usage. 
The aim is to identify possible improvements to 
reduce energy consumption of these processes.
With evolving environmental legislation within 
Europe and USA, Avon ensures compliance through 
regular environmental updates from its membership 
to the Institute of Environmental Management and 
Assessment (IEMA).
In order to secure the 
future of the business 
we are committed 
to contributing to 
economic, social 
and environmental 
sustainability, both 
locally and globally. The 
Directors acknowledge 
that this involves 
balancing the interests 
of shareholders, 
employees, customers, 
suppliers and the wider 
communities in which 
our business operates.
THE GROUP’S APPROACH
A forward thinking approach to health and safety, 
the environment, business ethics and employee 
engagement are of paramount importance and we 
constantly endeavour to improve our systems to 
maintain our excellent record.

MANDATORY CARBON REDUCTION SCHEME
The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 requires 
quoted companies to include within their annual 
report details of greenhouse gas emissions 
for which they are responsible and other 
environmental matters for which key  
performance indicators are selected.
Avon has employees in each of its facilities who are 
responsible for collecting and acting on the data.  
The collected data allows the organisation to 
monitor and examine carbon emission trends.

BUSINESS ETHICS
Our Code of Conduct (‘the Code’) sets out the 
values and standards of behaviour expected from 
all those working for or on behalf of Avon and 
is available on the Group’s website. The Code 
requires all representatives of the Group to comply 
with the laws and regulations in the countries 
in which we operate. It also contains guidance 
on avoiding conflicts of interest, confidentiality, 
adherence to export controls, our approach to 
gifts and hospitality, bribery and corruption and 
managing relationships with third parties. 
We encourage everyone to report any behaviour, 
which may be a breach of the Code, or is unethical 
or illegal. 
We implement and enforce effective systems to 
uphold our zero-tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption. To ensure we only work with third 
parties whose standards are consistent with our 
own, all agents and third parties who act on behalf 
of the Group are obliged by written agreement to 
comply with the standards set out in the Code. In 
addition, a programme of supplier audits exists to 
ensure suppliers adhere to Avon’s standards.
Avon is fully committed to respecting the human 
rights of all those working with or for us. We do not 
accept any form of child or forced labour and we 
will not do business with anyone who fails to uphold 
these standards.
Avon has a zero-tolerance approach to modern 
slavery and is committed to acting with integrity 
in all of its business dealings and relationships and 
to implementing and enforcing effective measures 
to ensure modern slavery is not taking place in the 
business or its supply chains. Our first Modern 
Slavery Act statement is on our website and will be 
updated in 2018 to reflect the progress made. 
EMPLOYEES
Our success depends on our people. The Group aims 
to support all employees to develop their potential 
and we are committed to recognising, encouraging 
and nurturing talent across our business. 
We are committed to providing a working 
environment where everyone feels respected and 
valued and we pursue equality of opportunity in 
all employment practices, policies and procedures 
regardless of race, nationality, gender, age, marital 
status, sexual orientation, disability and religious or 
political beliefs. A formal diversity policy is in place, 
setting out our approach to diversity. A copy can 
be found in the corporate governance section of 
our website.

Environment and Corporate Social Responsibility continued
“Great Place to Work is a framework 
that gives every  employee an 
opportunity to contribute towards a 
culture  that truly does make Avon a 
great place to work. The framework 
comprises five key areas: Recognition, 
Communication, Wellbeing, 
Community and Training and 
Development.”
RECOGNITION
All employees have a part to play in 
ensuring Avon remains a great place 
to work. One of our corporate values 
is to motivate our people through 
appropriate recognition and  
reward programmes.
 
Under our reward programme, employees 
can nominate colleagues whom they believe 
embody one or more of the CREED values in 
their job performance. Each month all those 
nominated receive a recognition award from 
the Group, with a quarterly and annual winner 
selected from those nominated. The 2017 
Albinea Annual Site winner, Giovanni Grasselli, 
is pictured above with Paul McDonald, Chief 
Executive Officer. 
COMMUNICATION 
Employee engagement is important 
to us and effective communication 
throughout the business is vital in 
achieving this. 
We communicate our strategy, performance 
and business priorities to all employees in a 
variety of ways, including through our intranet 
sites, email and quarterly newsletters as 
well as through regular employee meetings 
at all levels of the organisation. We also 
encourage employees to provide feedback 
to the business, either face to face or 
through discussion boards on our intranet. 
All employees have the ability to make 
suggestions directly to the CEO via our  
‘Ask the CEO’ mailbox.
Part of the communication programme is our 
employee opinion survey. The survey gives 
employees the opportunity to give anonymous 
feedback to management, which we assess and 
use to inspire improvement plans. The survey 
helps to ensure Avon listens to its employees 
and strives for continuing improvement. This 
year’s survey had a response rate of 67% 
against a target of 50%. The responses are 
evaluated by each level of management and it 
will continue to be a platform that helps Avon 
invest in its people and drive success. 
WELLBEING
Under our wellbeing initiative, we 
offer healthy lifestyle support and 
advice, with the aim of encouraging 
better health and wellbeing for 
all employees.
We believe wellbeing works best when the 
experience is a shared one, we have regular 
global wellness challenges for our employees 
to take part in to help stimulate small changes 
to improve their overall health. These include 
challenges related to increasing activity levels, 
eating healthier and drinking more water.
We have a global wellness week each year 
with a variety of activities on offer at all of our 
sites including healthy eating options in our 
canteens, a wellness fair and health quizzes. 
Pictured above is the team at AEF and their 
healthy lunchtime options.
Our wellbeing programme also covers 
financial wellness. We operate group-wide 
employee share plans to encourage our staff 
to participate in the future of the Group 
through share ownership. All UK employees 
are entitled to participate in the Share 
Incentive Plan whilst US employees are 
invited to join the Employee Stock Purchase 
Plan. Both provide the opportunity to 
purchase shares through payroll deductions.
COMMUNITY
We aim to work with and for the 
communities in which we operate, 
recognising our role as a major employer 
in our geographical site locations. We 
are aware of the impact the Group has 
on its local environment and seek to 
contribute to its economic, social and 
environmental sustainability.
Our community programme is led from the 
bottom up rather than top down, which means 
each site is empowered to create their own 
initiatives to help benefit their local community. 
Engaging with, and giving back positively 
to the local community ensures that we are 
supporting our employees, their friends and 
families. We also work with many charitable 
organisations who are involved in some way 
with the areas of business in which we operate.
This year we launched the #thinkSTEM 
campaign to help address the issue of skills 
shortage in science, technology, engineering 
and maths careers. Through this campaign, we 
want to inspire more young people to consider 
STEM related careers and we do this by working 
with our local schools to engage with pupils 
from a young age to help them understand the 
different opportunities available to them.
We recognise the value provided to local and 
wider communities by members of the reserve 
forces and those in public service. We are 
proud to have employees serving and a number 
of our employees are part of service families. 
We support their commitment and dedication 
to serve.
It’s not just about supporting our local 
communities, it’s also about creating a 
community at work. That’s why we offer 
opportunities for our employees to establish 
relationships with each other outside of their  
day to day job. From football matches to 
bake-offs, we want our employees to feel 
that working within and for the community 
is embedded within the culture of the 
organisation. Pictured below is the bake-off  
held at our Melksham facility to raise money 
for Macmillan Cancer Support.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
We want to attract, retain and 
develop talented individuals.
We strive to provide an environment that 
offers the right training and development to 
ensure we retain our employees. By providing 
a combination of formal training opportunities 
and on the job experiences, our employees 
have the opportunity to achieve their 
potential and become the future leaders  
of our business.
We will run our flagship Global Leadership 
Programme in the new financial year for 
individuals identified as having the potential 
to be future leaders. Several of our senior 
executives and other influential managers 
have previously completed this programme, 
which is testimony to the value added to the 
business from this initiative. 
Our global Professional Development 
Programme has completed two cycles. 
The programme enables participants across 
our business to manage their own career 
development through setting self-learning 
objectives with the help and guidance of a 
mentor from the senior leadership team and  
an external facilitator. 
Employees can apply for training grants for 
qualifications they wish to work towards. 
Avon funds half of the tuition fees and loans 
the other half to the employee, repaid over 
time. So far the initiative has helped the 
continued development of many departments 
across the business.
We also offer numerous positions for 
placement students in our engineering team, 
both in the US and the UK. The students 
help us tackle real-world engineering 
problems as they learn about the profession 
as well as having the potential for long-term 
employment within Avon. A number of our 
student placements have taken up full-time 
employment with the Group following their 
graduation and contribute significantly to 
Group achievements. 
Our graduate recruitment scheme is now in 
its third year and two new graduates joined in 
September to support the growing needs of 
our business. The scheme is based on a two 
year ‘work and learn’ programme designed to 
bring new talent into our organisation.
