 Chairman’s Statement
I am delighted to be making my first annual 
statement to you following my appointment as 
Chairman of Tate & Lyle from 1 April 2017. 
I am passionate about food, having started my career 
as a food scientist, and have remained close to the 
industry ever since. My path has crossed Tate & Lyle’s 
on several occasions during my career and I am very 
excited to join a company that I have long admired for 
its strong heritage, values and expertise. 
I am honoured to succeed Sir Peter Gershon who 
retired on 31 March 2017 after serving on the Board 
for eight years. I would like to thank him sincerely for 
his outstanding service and significant contribution 
to Tate & Lyle during his tenure. Peter leaves the 
Company in great shape, performing well with a 
clear strategy and strong governance. 
I look forward to working with the Board and the 
executive team to realise Tate & Lyle’s potential  
for development, growth and value creation for 
shareholders. 
Delivering for shareholders
I am pleased to report that T ate & Lyle delivered 
excellent performance in the year ended 31 March 2017 
with profits and earnings per share both well ahead 
of the prior year. Cash generation was particularly 
strong and the balance sheet remains robust, 
providing flexibility to support future growth whilst 
maintaining dividend distribution to shareholders. 
The Board recognises the importance to our 
shareholders not only of the dividend, but also  
of its sustainability, and the need to re-build cash 
dividend cover over time. Accordingly, the Board 
recommends an unchanged final dividend for the 
year ended 31 March 2017 of 19.8p to make an 
unchanged total for the year of 28.0p. Looking to the 
future, as dividend cover is re-built, we remain 
committed to a progressive policy of growing the 
dividend over time, taking into account the earnings 
prospects and investment needs of the business.
Delivering responsibly 
Tate & Lyle is committed to achieving strong 
performance for shareholders whilst maintaining a 
sharp and relentless focus on the safety and 
sustainability of our business. 
In January, we launched an extensive Group-wide 
review of all our safety processes and procedures, 
supported by an independent external expert 
consultancy with deep experience in global safety 
assessments. This follows an industrial accident at 
one of our grain elevators in the US, in September 
2016, when sadly one of our employees and a local 
farmer died. A number of significant management 
actions have already been implemented in our US 
grain elevator network to strengthen safety 
processes, further explained in the Corporate 
Responsibility section on page 44.
We expect the external review will conclude in the 
first half of the current financial year. The Board and 
the executive team will work together to ensure that 
the review’s findings are carefully considered and 
recommended actions implemented 
comprehensively and with urgency. Our ultimate 
goal remains to have no accidents and no injuries 
and this incident has made us all the more 
determined to build a safer Tate & Lyle for all our 
employees, contractors and visitors. There is no 
higher priority in the Group.
 A year of 
excellent 
progress

performance with impressive 
financial results
12 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Four years ago, Tate & Lyle set itself ambitious 
sustainability targets to reduce the environmental 
impact of the business. We achieved our targets for 
packaging and sustainable agriculture and at the 
end of March 2017 we had exceeded our 2016 CO
2
e 
emissions target. We also achieved a leadership 
position of A- in the CDP (formerly the Carbon 
Disclosure Project). Building on these achievements, 
we have set ourselves new stretching targets for 
2020 (full details on page 48).
Our commitment to the United Nations (UN) 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) remains  
a key part of our sustainability agenda. A key 
objective for the year ahead is the acceleration  
of our progress towards the UN SDG targets.
Governance and Board composition 
There have been a number of changes to the  
Board since the last AGM. I joined the Board on 
1 January 2017, succeeding Sir Peter Gershon  
as Chairman on 1 April 2017. Liz Airey retired as 
Senior Independent Director on 31 December 2016 
and, after 10 years of service, will retire from the 
Board at the AGM in July 2017. Douglas Hurt 
assumed the role of Senior Independent Director 
from 1 January 2017, in addition to his role as 
chairman of the Audit Committee. William Camp 
stepped down as a Non-Executive Director and 
chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee 
on 31 March 2017, having served on the Board since 
2010. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
both Liz and William for their outstanding service 
and significant contribution both to the Board and  
to Tate & Lyle.
In October 2016, Jeanne Johns joined the Board  
as a Non-Executive Director. Jeanne assumed 
chairmanship of the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee on 1 April 2017 and is also a member  
of the Nominations and Remuneration Committees. 
During her 30-year career in the oil industry with  
BP , Jeanne held numerous leadership roles in 
Europe, the US and China and latterly served as the 
Head of Safety and Operational Risk for BP’s global 
downstream business.
I look forward to working with the 
Board and the executive team to 
realise Tate & Lyle’s potential for 
development, growth and value 
creation for shareholders. 
Summary 
Tate & Lyle has performed well this year and I would 
like to thank our management team and employees 
for all the hard work, dedication and skill essential 
to this success. Since my appointment to the Board, 
I have already visited a number of the Group’s 
facilities in North America and Europe and look 
forward to seeing some of our sites in Asia and 
Latin America in the coming months. I have been 
impressed by the unwavering passion, enthusiasm 
and commitment of all the colleagues I have met. 
Like many global businesses, we are facing an 
evolving and challenging geopolitical landscape, but 
we do so with confidence as a strong and financially 
solid company. I am excited about Tate & Lyle’s 
future. With our clear strategy, strong product 
portfolio and outstanding people, we are well-
positioned for continuing and sustainable growth.
