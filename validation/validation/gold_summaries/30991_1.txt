 12 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
DELIVERING ON GROWTH
I am pleased to report on another year of 
strong growth in our service businesses and 
one which has also seen clinical success. We 
see significant opportunities to build on the 
foundations we have established in high-
growth areas within the pharmaceutical 
services market and, specifically, to take 
leadership positions in pharmacovigilance 
and orphan drug development services. We 
believe this will deliver further growth and 
shareholder value in the future.
Services
Overall it was a strong year within the services businesses. 
New business won in 2017 of £54 million, up 29% on 2016, 
helped drive net service revenue growth of 36% to £39.6 
million. Total service revenue, including reimbursement 
revenue, increased 21% to £47.6 million.
EBITDA (adjusted) for the year was £2.8 million compared 
with £2.8 million in 2016. R&D expense, related to the 
development of the Haemostatix products, was £2.7 million 
in 2017 and £1.2 million in 2016. The EBITDA (adjusted) of our 
services businesses (excluding R&D) was £5.5 million in 2017 
compared with £4.0 million in 2016.
Drug Safety & Medical Information (DS&MI)
The DS&MI business, which comprises the PrimeVigilance and 
PharmInvent companies, performed exceptionally strongly. Net 
service revenue from the DS&MI segment, increased 68% to 
£22.2 million in 2017 from £13.3 million in 2016. Excluding the 
PharmInvent acquisition (completed in November 2016), organic 
growth of the DS&MI segment was 35%. 
PharmInvent was acquired in November 2016, and 
immediately successfully collaborated with PrimeVigilance 
to provide a comprehensive pharmacovigilance service 
offering to existing and new clients of both companies. The 
integration was completed early in 2018, with both companies 
now operating under the PrimeVigilance brand led by Dr Jan 
Petracek. PrimeVigilance now employs over 450 employees 
with hubs in Guildford, UK; Belgrade, Serbia; Prague, Czech 
Republic; Boston, USA; and Zagreb, Croatia.
PrimeVigilance, which is already a significant investor in 
information technology, has initiated the implementation of 
robotic process automation for certain routine pharmacovigilance 
processes, resulting in significant improvements in efficiency and 
accuracy. PrimeVigilance’s strategy of investing in people and 
technology is designed to drive further growth with the aim of 
becoming the global leader in pharmacovigilance by 2020. The 
global pharmacovigilance market is forecast to grow to more than  
$8Bn by 2024 from around $3Bn in 2015, with contract 
outsourcing forecast to expand from around 30% of the market 
in 2015 to approximately 50% in 2024. (Source: Global Market 
Insights 2016.)
Contract Research Services (CRS)
Net service revenue from the CRS segment increased 9% to 
£17.4 million in 2017 from £15.9 million in 2016. Excluding the 
PSR acquisition (October 2017), organic growth was 3%.
Consistent with our acquisition strategy of adding specialist 
skills and/or geographic coverage, PSR was acquired in 
October 2017 for a total consideration of up to €5.7 million 
(£5.1 million). PSR is a specialist contract research organisation 
based in The Netherlands that specialises in the development 
of orphan drugs for rare diseases. Orphan drug development 
is a growing area, with up to 30 million people worldwide 
estimated to suffer from rare diseases (Source: Evaluate 
Pharma Orphan Drug Report 2017). The logistical, regulatory 
and operational complexities associated with orphan drug 
trials require specialised approaches. PSR, combined with 
Ergomed’s site management organisation and study physician 
groups, is ideally suited for efficient management of these 
types of trials.
The Company’s goal is to become the leading global contract 
research organisation for orphan drug development and, 
overall, to continue to outpace the market for clinical 
research services.

Global demand for quality outsourced drug safety services 
and drug development remains strong and Ergomed 
continues to benefit from these trends. Ergomed ended 2017 
with a total backlog of contracted work with a value to be 
invoiced in future years of approximately £88 million  
(2016: £70 million).
Product development
Co-development
A new co-development deal with Allergy Therapeutics plc 
(LSE: AGY) was announced in December 2017.The multi-
study co-development partnership is aimed at supporting the 
commercialisation of Allergy Therapeutics’ OraiVac platform 
and could include studies of three OraiVac products.
The Company also announced the following updates during 
the year:
  Ferrer: In February 2017, Ferrer announced data from the 
successful Phase II study of lorediplon in insomnia.
  Aeterna Zentaris (NASDAQ: AEZS; TSX: AEZ): In May 
2017, Aeterna Zentaris announced termination of their 
programme after Zoptrex™ showed no treatment benefit 
over doxorubicin control.
  CEL-SCI (NYSE: CVM): The FDA lifted the clinical hold for 
Multikine® in August 2017 and the Phase III study in head 
and neck cancer is continuing as initially planned.
We believe our co-development pipeline continues to offer 
potential upside as programmes progress and move towards 
commercialisation. However, as we increase our focus on the 
opportunities within our service businesses to take leadership 
positions in high-growth markets, the Board has concluded 
that expanding the co-development pipeline is no longer 
a strategic priority for the Company. We do not anticipate 
announcing new co-development deals, unless material, but 
will continue to benefit from our experience and ability to 
engage in co-development selectively as a differentiator for 
our CRO offering.
Haemostatix
In October, the Company announced positive Phase II results 
of PeproStat in surgical bleeding, the first product to come 
from the Haemostatix portfolio. The trial met its primary 
endpoint and was completed approximately six months ahead 
of schedule. PeproStat showed time to haemostasis of 4.2 
minutes, a reduction of 1.6 minutes compared with standard 
of care time to haemostasis of 5.8 minutes. It also met key 
secondary endpoints and was highly rated by investigators. 
No treatment related serious adverse events or re-bleeding 
were observed. These results reinforce PeproStat’s potential 
as a safe, blood-free, ready-to-use and cost-effective method 
of controlling bleeding during surgery.
The second product, HXP12 ReadyFlow™, a flowable gel, is 
proceeding with preclinical development and is expected to 
be ready for Phase I in 2018.
A license for rights to PeproStat and HXP12 ReadyFlow in 
South Korea was signed in October 2017.
The Company’s strategy is to pursue further development 
of the Haemostatix assets through partnerships and 
collaborations. We anticipate further modest investment in 
R&D related to Haemostatix during 2018, in line with current 
market expectations. 
Outlook
A contracted backlog of £88 million underpins Ergomed’s 
ability to deliver its targets for 2018. Drug safety and medical 
information services make up an increasing proportion of our 
overall revenues and owing to their greater predictability and 
exceptional growth we benefit from greater visibility than with 
clinical research services which, although capable of attractive 
margins are lumpy by nature and highly competitive.
More generally during the coming period we expect to 
continue to deliver on our strategy of focusing on the growth 
and profitability of our services businesses, supplemented by 
acquisitions that expand the services offering or geographical 
coverage, or both.
