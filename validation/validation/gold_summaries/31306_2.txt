Aggregate 2017 year end production of approximately 2,800 boepd, compared with approximately 1,700 
boepd at 2016 year end, representing an increase of nearly 65% over the year, largely as a result of the 
significant contributions of the new MEX-109 well and the successful workover of the SV-2 well
Average production from the MEX-GOL and SV fields over the year to 31 December 2017 was 197,961 m

OUTLOOK
Focus during 2018 at MEX-GOL and SV fields on completion of geophysical studies on existing seismic 
data and refinement of new geological model, workover of SV-12 well, planning for new well, installation of 
additional compression equipment, continued investment in gas processing facilities and pipeline network, and 
upgrading of existing wells 
Focus during 2018 at VAS field on acquisition, processing and interpretation of new 3D seismic, drilling of VAS-10 
well and continued investment in gas processing facilities, pipeline network and other infrastructure 
Funding of 2018 development programme planned to be from existing cash resources and operational 
cash flow
