 Strategic Report
IDH 
at a Glance
Integrated Diagnostics Holdings (“IDH,” the “Group,” or 
the “Company”) is a leading consumer healthcare com-
pany with operations in Egypt, Jordan, Sudan and Nigeria.  
A long track record for quality and safety has earned the 
Group a trusted reputation, as well as internationally 
recognised accreditations for its portfolio of over 1,400 
diagnostics tests. From its base of 383 branches as of 31 
December 2017, the Company will continue to add labo-
ratories through a Hub, Spoke and Spike business model 
that provides a scalable platform for efficient expansion. 
Beyond organic growth, IDH’s expansion plans include 
acquisitions in new Middle Eastern and African markets 
where its model is well-suited to capitalise on similar 
healthcare and consumer trends and capture a significant 
share of underpenetrated and highly-fragmented markets. 
Notably in early 2018, the Group expanded its geographic 
footprint with an investment in Nigeria, Africa’s largest and 
most populous country. IDH has been a Jersey-registered 
entity with a Standard Listing on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange since May 2015.
