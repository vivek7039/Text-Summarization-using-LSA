  Five key strengths of Ibstock plc
Our market-leading businesses enable 
us to benefit from the expected growth 
in demand in the UK and our regional 
markets within the US.
Many of our long-standing customer 
relationships have lasted over 40 years. 
Our customer focus is based on quality, 
service and consistency and our 
service-led ethos is one of the key 
drivers in the growth of our market 
share in bricks over the past 10 years.
Our management team has extensive 
experience in the building products 
market with our Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer having 
combined experience of over 50 years 
within the industry. They are ably 
supported by our Group Executive 
Committee who have an average of 
18 years’ experience.
We have 28 clay and 15 concrete plants 
throughout the UK and US manufacturing 
over 500 varieties of bricks coupled 
with ownership of valuable long-term 
clay reserves.
 – 43 main manufacturing sites; 33 UK 
sites and 10 US sites.
 – Over 150 million tonnes of consented 
clay reserves and in excess of an 
additional 100 million tonnes of clay 
resources. 
 – Realisable production capacity of 
1.2 billion bricks per annum.
In the UK, demand for building products is 
anticipated to increase due to Government 
support for new housebuilding, increasing 
household formations and population 
growth. We have invested in the latest 
technology to increase capacity and to 
meet the growing market demands.
 – The new Leicester plant, which 
commenced commissioning in Q4 
2017 , is expected to add capacity of 
circa 100 million bricks per annum.
 – The capacity expansion project at 
our Lodge Lane blue brick plant in 
Cannock began commissioning in Q4 
2017 . This investment in a replacement 
kiln increases capacity and maintains 
the Group’s leading position as a full 
range supplier.
