 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Introduction
We have again enjoyed another very successful year with revenues and profits growing to record levels both organically and through 
acquisition as we continue to deliver an ever broader range of cloud solutions.
Our revenues in the year were £89.6m, an increase of 17% over the previous year, our adjusted EBITDA of £36.6m showed a 13% 
increase over the previous year and our profit before tax also increased by 13% to £14.7m. 
The opportunity remains to continue to grow both organically and through a disciplined acquisition strategy. 
Market
The market for cloud services continues to grow and evolve. There is still a long runway of opportunity as the ‘IT as a service’ philosophy 
and delivery unfolds. There is an inevitability around this fundamental change in how IT is delivered but there is also a built in delay 
mechanism as systems, processes and applications are dealt with on a ‘one by one’ basis rather than in one full organisation wide 
swoop, as applications and workloads are individually considered for an upgrade, refresh or rewrite.
Security has again been in the headlines and it serves to show that on premise infrastructure is far more difficult to keep secure and 
available on a 24x7x365 basis than those in the cloud, in specialist datacentres, with 24x7x365 monitoring and management and with 
all the required perimeter defences in place.
We believe that iomart is one of the most compliant organisations with regard to security and certification in the sector. This will drive 
more opportunity for us, with our long experience of security whether it be infrastructure and network protection, detection and 
response to threats, access control, log management, or compliance with various standards.
We are now less than a year away from the introduction of the new regulations around data security, the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). Our plans for the introduction of these regulations are well advanced both for the Group’s own needs and to help 
other organisations understand the implications for their own business and thereby to become compliant.
Organisations today are confronted by an increasingly complex set of cloud decisions in terms of cost, value, effectiveness, complexity, 
security, data protection and compliance. Whatever the cloud challenge iomart can assist all organisations in moving to the cloud, 
whether it be private, public or hybrid approach. The long term recurring revenue opportunity for iomart remains compelling. We are 
well established as a major player in providing the flexible cloud solutions that businesses require.
The future success of cloud companies will be driven by their ability to address further towards the application layer as well as the 
underlying infrastructure. There is growing evidence of different market segments with distinct hosting and cloud requirements and 
characteristics. This is leading to a growing trend in specialisation in various verticals such as e-commerce or financial software and 
this is one reason why the hosting and cloud markets will be served by a wide variety of vendors and vendor types.
Our challenge is to continue to navigate through these early days of the further evolution of cloud adoption and to ensure we build 
the skills and resources necessary to be successful in that ever more complex space.
Acquisitions
We again augmented our organic growth through the acquisition of Cristie Data Limited (“Cristie”) in August and after the year-end, in 
May, through the acquisition of Dediserve Limited (“Dediserve”), a Dublin based provider of Cloud solutions in ten locations around the 
world. To date we have not seen any impact from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union other than the weakening of Sterling. 
The Board has considered the impact on the Group of the UK’s decision to leave and whilst there are still many issues to be resolved 
we believe we will be able to deal with them as they arise. The acquisition of Dediserve gives us a Cloud operation in geographical areas 
where we do not currently have a presence, including another base in the European Union.
We continue to look for businesses that fit our criteria with a view to making further acquisitions in the coming year.
Operational Review
We have previously reported in two operating segments (Cloud Services and Easyspace) both of which involve the provision of services 
from common infrastructure delivering a very high level of recurring revenue. During the year we acquired Cristie and we have decided 
to report that in a separate segment as it predominantly involves the provision of IT infrastructure on customers’ premises with little 
by the way of recurring revenue. We have designated this segment as Non-recurring Revenue.

Cloud Services 
Revenues in this segment have grown by 11% to £72.7m (2016: £65.4m) partly as a result of the continued organic growth and as a 
result of acquisitions. Organic growth in the year was 10%, slightly above the level of 9% we have delivered in our last two financial years 
and our adjusted EBITDA percentage margin continues to be amongst the highest in the industry.
Through our iomart Cloud unit we provide complex hosting solutions, involving private, public and hybrid cloud solutions with 
customers typically paying for these services on a monthly basis on contracts ranging from one to three years in length. Our churn 
levels in this unit have stabilised and are in line with that experienced last year.
Our server infrastructure business, delivering dedicated physical servers to customers, is run as one unit encompassing the RapidSwitch 
and Redstation brands. We manage many thousands of physical servers for our customers using highly automated systems and 
processes which we continue to develop and improve. 
Our Back-up and Disaster Recovery specialism is primarily sold through Backup Technology.
SystemsUp provides consultancy services to organisations, particularly in the public sector, helping them to decide on their cloud 
strategy with an emphasis on the public cloud. Having a consultancy division within the Group allows us to engage at an earlier stage 
with organisations considering their cloud strategy and provides the opportunity to leverage the provision of those consultancy services 
to gain recurring revenue through the deployment of cloud solutions. However, unlike our other activities within the Cloud Services 
segment there is less recurring revenue generated from consultancy services and this area has not performed as predicted during 
the year and in future we will be more prudent in projecting the revenues which we expect to generate to recognise the difficulty in 
estimating revenue levels. We have made some changes to senior management within the consultancy unit and have also refined its 
strategic approach to focus on the delivery of a set of core cloud technologies. This is with a view to ensuring that as often as possible 
projects that are delivered will ultimately have a managed service and recurring revenue element.
We are able to supply products and services across the cloud spectrum and do so using common platforms across the Group.
Within the scope of our product set we have strengthened our relationships with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft now 
labelled as Hypercloud vendors. Both are growing strongly on a global basis although they still account for a very small fraction of 
overall IT and Cloud spend.
We are now an Advanced Partner of AWS and moving towards the next level. We are one of Microsoft’s most respected Cloud Service 
Providers in the UK and we are being presented with a growing number of Microsoft Azure opportunities. 
We continue to build on our skills and accreditations and see constant improvement across the Group’s skillset.
Easyspace
In line with our expectations the Easyspace segment has performed well over the year, returning to a position of organic revenue 
growth. 
Our activities within this segment provide a range of products to the micro and SME markets including domain names, shared, 
dedicated and virtual servers and email services.
Revenues in the segment have grown by 22% to £13.2m (2016: £10.9m) mainly as a result of the acquisition of United Hosting in the 
previous year.  Organic growth in the year was 4% against a decline of 8% in the previous year.
Non-recurring revenue
The non-recurring revenue segment contains the results of Cristie since we acquired that business in August 2016. In just over 7 
months of ownership the revenue generated was £3.6m. 
Cristie primarily provides solutions similar to those provided by the Cloud Services segment with the exception that they would tend to 
be less complex in nature and predominantly installed on the customers’ own premises rather than from a datacentre location. These 
solutions would involve, for example, the provision of storage and back-up infrastructure. Cristie has a substantial number of public 
sector customers in areas such as health and education and we welcome its activities into the Group.
Current trading and outlook
This has been another year of strong growth and trading since the year end remains good.
The long term opportunity and runway for success remains large and long. iomart remains well positioned to take advantage of that 
opportunity and to deliver further significant growth.
I look forward, once again, with confidence to the year ahead.
