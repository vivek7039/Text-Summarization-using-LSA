 Introduction
I am honoured to have the opportunity to write to you as we 
report our full year results for 2017 having been appointed as 
Chairman in September. I would like to pay tribute to Gerald 
Corbett who has guided the company since its debut as a 
public company in 2005. Under his stewardship Britvic has 
diversified its presence into new markets and quadrupled its 
market valuation. On behalf of everyone at Britvic I would like 
to thank him for his service and commitment to Britvic and we 
wish him well for the future.
Review of the Year
Our 2017 results delivered a solid growth in revenue to 
£1,540.8m (2016: £1,431.3m), despite continued challenging 
market conditions. Adjusted EBITA* increased by 5.1% to 
£195.5m, translating into adjusted earnings per share* of 
52.9p. Statutory profit after tax declined 2.5% to £111.6m, 
reflecting the costs incurred by the business which related to 
the three-year business capability programme which started 
in 2016. During 2017, the Executive team have successfully 
overseen and delivered transformational change to the 
business which has included:
• In relation to the business capability programme we have 
installed new production lines, built new on-site warehousing 
and undertaken major groundworks for the ﬁ nal phase. 
This will enable the business to be more effi  cient and able 
to compete at the highest level 
• The completion of two acquisitions, in Ireland and Brazil. 
Both these businesses are complementary to the company’s 
strategy and will support our growth ambitions in the 
respective markets.
Further information of our performance can be found on 
pages 40 to 43.
Our People
Our employees are at the heart of this business. This year 
has been a testing one for many of them, the business 
capability programme has put pressure on them to deliver 
change whilst maintaining service to our customers and 
ultimately our consumers. 
CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
FOCUSED ON 
THE FUTURE
John Daly 
Chairman
Britvic is in a strong position 
today and I am confident in its 
ability to grow and capitalise 
on opportunities as they arise 
in the future. 
08 www.britvic.com Having visited some of our sites I am extremely impressed 
by the tenacity, passion and commitment that they have 
demonstrated. This level of commitment and passion 
exists throughout Britvic and on behalf of the Board I would 
like to thank all of them for their hard work. In October we 
announced a proposal to close our Norwich site with the loss 
of 242 roles. This was not an easy decision for the Board and 
senior management team but one that we felt necessary to 
protect the long-term prospects of the business. As a Board, 
we are committed to treating those affected with respect and 
dignity and the proposal in no way reflected their performance. 
Every effort will be made to re-deploy those who wish to 
transfer to other sites and we will provide every assistance 
for those seeking to find new roles elsewhere.
The Board
Having succeeded Gerald as Chairman we have made 
some further changes to the board. Sue Clark has been 
appointed Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Ian 
McHoul appointed Senior Independent Director whilst 
remaining Chair of the Audit Committee. Both Sue and Ian 
have extensive multinational experience that has benefited 
the Board since they joined in recent years. In September, 
Joanne Averiss stepped down from the board as the PepsiCo 
nominated director. Ben Gordon will reach the end of his ninth 
year of tenure in 2018 and it has been agreed that Ben will step 
down in early 2018 and will not seek re-election at the AGM. 
Both Joanne and Ben have made valuable contributions during 
their tenure and I would like to thank them for their support 
and wish them well for the future. In view of Joanne and 
Ben’s retirement from the Board, I am delighted to announce 
the appointment of Suniti Chauhan and William Eccleshare, 
effective 29 November 2017. Suniti brings significant M&A, 
corporate finance and development experience whilst William 
has a strong background in marketing and innovation. They 
are excellent additions to the the Board as we look to continue 
to develop our business in the UK and internationally.
Looking Ahead
The long-term prospects for this business are good and on 
behalf of the Board, we look forward to continuing to support 
Simon, Mat and the wider management team as they continue 
to deliver the strategy. Next year the business faces a unique 
event with the introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy 
(SDIL) in both the UK and Ireland. Whilst this may well lead 
to some short-term volatility in the industry, I am confident 
we have the right portfolio to navigate through this challenge. 
Britvic is in a strong position today and I am confident in its 
ability to grow and capitalise on opportunities as they arise 
in the future.
The AGM will be held at 11am on 31 January 2018 at 
the offices of Linklaters LLP and I look forward to seeing 
you there. Further information can be found in the Notice 
of Meeting which is available on the Britvic website at
