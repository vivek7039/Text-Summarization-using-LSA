OUR CORE VALUES

see pages 60-61
After FY2016, where we showed our 
resilience in the face of a challenging 
economic climate, it is a pleasure to 
report that FY2017 was about price 
recovery and exciting potential. 
Three key characteristics of Vedanta 
emerged from the year. 
First, we are stronger. Having weathered 
the prior year’s market downturn, we 
have continued to build on our status 
as a low-cost, diversified producer. 
During FY2017 we also delivered our 
promised merger of Cairn India Limited 
(Cairn India) and Vedanta Limited, 
simplifying the Group structure. This 
is a significant step forward towards 
achieving our stated long-term vision 
of alignment of interests between all 
shareholders for the creation of long-
term sustainable value. We continued 
to strengthen our financial position, 
through our focus on deleveraging 
our balance sheet and extending 
maturity commitments. We have also 
enjoyed the upturn in the market, with 
the strong zinc and aluminium prices 
playing to our particular strengths.
Second, we are working smarter. 
In a country focused on technology 
and digitalisation we are acquiring 
best-in-class technology for our 
assets, and focusing on creating our 
own. During the year, we initiated a 
US$30 million investment fund for 
in-house R&D, supporting our wealth 
of knowledge and spirit of innovation 
with meaningful resources. We are 
also actively incentivising our people 
to contribute their own ideas. 
Third, we continue to operate 
sustainably, focusing on creating value 
and opportunity for all our stakeholders: 
employees, communities, investors 
and the countries we operate in. This is 
coupled with a firm aim to achieve ‘zero 
harm, zero waste and zero discharge’. 
We are determined to mine safely and 
sensitively, minimising our environmental 
impact and being receptive to 
the needs of the local people.  07

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
We are in the business of producing 
commodities and supplying energy that 
make lives and economies better, from 
the essentials for creating infrastructure, 
to the basic needs of transportation and 
power and the material requirements 
of manufacturing consumer goods. 
We are also excellently located: 
Vedanta operates primarily in India and 
Africa, countries that are endowed 
with an abundant supply of natural 
resources, and have growing economies 
waiting to make good use of them. 
As an efficient and experienced natural 
resources player, we offer investors an 
opportunity to take part in the 
extraordinary growth story of India as it 
seeks to improve its infrastructure, 
house its growing population and 
develop its manufacturing base. 
HOW WE PERFORMED 
With a strong operational performance 
and a supportive market environment, 
we were able to deliver encouraging 
numbers for FY2017 . 
Revenues rose to US$11 .5 billion with 
EBITDA at US$3.2 billion. EBITDA margin
 
(excluding custom smelting at Zinc India 
and Copper) was 36% and we delivered 
strong free cash flow of US$1 .5 billion. 
This led the Board to recommend a final 
dividend of 35 US cents per share. 
I was pleased that we were able to 
ramp up our production, despite some 
operational issues at the Aluminium 
and Power businesses and the Konkola 
Copper Mines (KCM). We were also 
successful in controlling costs at 
the majority of our businesses. 
I also deeply regret that the year saw 
seven fatalities in the course of our 
operations. There are no circumstances 
in which this is acceptable, and I am 
personally committed to eradicating 
such incidents.
INDIA 
Vedanta sits at the heart of the fastest-
growing economy in the world, and 
around 58% of our revenues are derived 
from our operations in the country. 
India is an exciting place to be. 
Prime Minister Modi’s government 
is spearheading huge changes in the 
business environment, and in turn this 
is making India a prime destination 
for investment. India attracted record 
foreign direct investment of more 
than US$45 billion
1
 in CY2016, and the 
country looks increasingly attractive to 
manufacturers and digital industries. 
The 'Make in India' government 
campaign to encourage national and 
multi-national companies to manufacture 
their products in India, is driving an 
exciting agenda of domestic growth. 
We expect to see the GDP growth of 
the nation translating into meaningful 
increases in metals and energy demand. 
1  Source: Department of Industry Policy and Promotion 
February 2017 .
Currently, India only produces 20% of its 
oil and mineral requirements and mining 
represents just 2.4% of GDP and the 
country is spending US$500 billion on 
imports. Y et we have a similar geology to 
Africa and Australia with highly attractive 
prospects for oil, base and precious 
metals, and other minerals. 
We remain a proud corporate citizen 
of India, and in FY2017 we contributed 
US$6 billion to the exchequer and 
supported, directly or indirectly, at 
least 70,000 jobs.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
AFRICA
Vedanta enjoys a productive and 
long-standing relationship with 
Africa, and during the year I was 
pleased to accompany India’s Prime 
Minister on a visit to South Africa, 
as part of his business delegation. 
We continue to invest in projects and 
assets in both India and Africa. Our 
zinc project in Gamsberg, South Africa 
is under active construction as we 
prepare to mine one of the world’s 
largest deposits of zinc. Given strong 
zinc market fundamentals, this venture 
looks increasingly well-timed and 
we look forward to production going 
live in 2018. We are also looking at 
extending the life of the successful 
Black Mountain and Skorpion zinc 
mines. This is in sharp contrast to a 
few years ago, when Skorpion was 
being considered for closure. 
In Zambia, although we experienced 
some operational challenges during 
the year, we continue to focus on 
being a leading player in copper. 
We have exciting technical projects 
planned, and are looking at initiatives 
both to ramp up volumes and 
develop captive power generation 
sources over the coming years. 
A COMPANY FOR COMMUNITIES 
For two decades now, Vedanta has 
maintained that financial returns alone 
are not the mark of a good business.  
We also care passionately about 
the well-being of our employees 
and, equally, the local communities 
in which we operate.
I am therefore proud to say that during 
the year, we backed our commitment to 
the communities we operate in with an 
investment of US$18 million towards 
community initiatives. 
A key part of our work in this area is to 
empower women and to give children 
the best possible start in life. As an 
example, Vedanta is participating in 
India’s ‘Nand Ghars’ (also known as 
Anganwadi) programme, helping to 
transform 4,000 state-run child welfare 
centres across the country to support 
women and children by providing the 
education, skills development and 
healthcare they need. 
In total, we support projects 
focused on constructive welfare 
and sustainability, impacting the 
lives of around 2.2 million people.
OUR PEOPLE
Following the difficult market 
environment of the prior year, I want 
to thank all of our employees whose 
energy, talents and commitment 
came to fruition in FY2017 . 
I would also like to thank my fellow 
Directors for their wise counsel and, in 
particular, our CEO Tom Albanese, who 
has been instrumental to Vedanta’s 
performance in his three years in the 
organisation. Tom’s contract came to its 
scheduled end in March, and he decided 
it was an appropriate juncture to make 
the personal decision to re-join his family 
in the US. 
He leaves the Company having made 
a strong impact with his ideas and 
efficiencies starting to show positive 
results. I thank him warmly for the 
successful part he has played in 
our story and we wish him well. 
Tom remains in his position until 
August 2017 and the search for his 
successor is well underway.
As announced earlier in the year, Euan 
Macdonald, Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and Sustainability 
Committee, retired from the Board. I 
would like to thank Euan for his huge 
contribution to sustainability at Vedanta, 
including improved safety standards and 
best practices in site closures. Katya 
Zotova, a member of our Sustainability 
Committee, will be leading its priorities 
in the coming year. Further, Edward 
Story has been appointed as a Non-
Executive Director of the Company 
with effect from 1 June 2017 . He will 
also be appointed as a member of 
the Company’s Audit Committee with 
effect from 1 June 2017 . I am delighted 
to welcome him to our Board. His 
background and domain experience in 
the oil & gas industry will significantly 
enhance our ability to grow and 
develop Vedanta’s oil & gas business.
I also welcome Ravi Rajagopal to his 
new roles, both as a Non-Executive 
Director of Vedanta Resources and to 
the Audit and Sustainability Committees. 
He comes with a wealth of experience 
across finance and operational 
roles in a FTSE 100 company.
In line with regulatory guidance, 
Mr Aman Mehta will retire at the 
conclusion of this year’s AGM. 
Meanwhile, he has overseen the 
Company’s transition to a new auditor 
for the Group and I would like to 
thank him for his sound guidance 
and commitment over the years. 
On behalf of the entire Board, I would 
also like to thank all our investors, 
communities and the governments 
of the countries in which we operate, 
for their constant support. 
FY2018: OPTIMISM AND DISCIPLINE
I am optimistic that the improvement 
in commodity markets we have 
experienced this year may be with 
us for the foreseeable future. 
Prices in copper, aluminium, 
zinc, iron ore, oil and gas have all 
shown a strong recovery last year, 
so we approach FY2018 with a 
cautious optimism and a continuing 
discipline in our capital allocation.
Meanwhile, we will continue to 
contribute to India’s exciting growth 
trajectory, working with the Indian 
Government, our employees and 
communities to make a difference.
