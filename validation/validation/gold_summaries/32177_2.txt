1 Certain ﬁnancial measures used in our Annual Report, such as operating cash proﬁt, are not deﬁned under IFRS and are therefore 
termed APMs. Further details on APMs are included on page 43.
2 The sale of our Debt Management business completed on 3 March 2017. The total return from the Debt Management business sold 
to Investcorp has been classiﬁed as discontinued operations and the prior period results have been re-presented. 
3 Operating cash proﬁt has been redeﬁned in the year and the prior year comparative restated. The rationale for the change together 
with the calculation is explained on page 31. Operating cash proﬁt includes the result of Debt Management.
