This has been an exciting year of 
development for the Company, with good 
progress in all areas of the business, a 
strong underlying performance and some 
great acquisitions that add real value to 
the Company.
We have successfully pursued our 
strategy to drive long-term value for  
our shareholders based around four  
key objectives:
• To drive footfall to our pubs
•  To develop our offer to enhance  
the customer experience
•  To create demand and build 
awareness for our brands
•  To attract, retain and develop  
the best people
It is this consistent strategy that has 
enabled the Company to outperform  
the national market year after year  
and to excel on a local basis. We have 
modernised and improved our business 
such that the profile and quality of our 
pubs and brands have been greatly 
enhanced and the offer and experience 
for our customer transformed. 
Furthermore, as our heartland of Kent 
enjoys the benefit of infrastructural 
development and the regeneration of the 
coastal areas, our strong local knowledge 
enables us to exploit the opportunities 
that arise.
Whilst the weather conditions have been 
favourable during this year with a long 
hot summer in 2016 and plenty of 
sunshine in the spring of 2017, market 
conditions have become progressively 
harder, as consumer spending is being 
squeezed by inflation. 
Nonetheless, we have achieved 
impressive like-for-like sales growth in  
our managed estate of +8.1% against the 
Coffer Peach Tracker Index* of +1.4% and 
own beer volume growth excluding 
contract of +3.9% against the market of 
-0.2% (Source: BBPA).
In pursuit of our objectives, this year has 
been characterised by some significant 
achievements:
•  Acquisition of 14 pubs
•  The launch of a new brand identity
•  Some exciting new product 
developments
•  Completion of the initial phase of our 
modernisation plan for the brewery 
and its buildings
We have successfully delivered these 
projects whilst maintaining strong 
underlying growth across the business.  
We have also developed our future 
brewing and brands strategy, namely to 
build our own brands, drive necessary cost 
reduction and streamline management 
roles where appropriate, as we exit the 
Asahi contract in the coming year.
We have an outstanding team of  
people, renowned for their passion  
and commitment, their expertise and  
in-depth knowledge of the business,  
their friendliness and approachability. 
These characteristics distinguish 
Shepherd Neame and give it its unique 
personality. It is this personality that is  
the differentiator to build customer 
loyalty, where quality and value for  
money are taken for granted.
All operators in the sector face significant 
cost inflation through increasing business 
rates, the national living wage and the 
apprenticeship levy. The fall in the value of 
sterling following the EU referendum has 
compounded these challenges and is 
driving up prices in food and other 
imported products such as wine. We will 
continue to focus on enhancing the 
customer experience, raising standards 
across our business, and driving 
efficiencies as appropriate to mitigate  
this cost and to take advantage of the 
opportunities that are presented. 
Tenanted and Managed Pub Operations
Overview
At the year-end we operated 327 pubs 
and hotels (2016: 328) of which 285 are 
freehold (2016: 285). Of our total pubs, 
66 (2016: 54) were managed and 253 
(2016: 267) were tenanted or leased  
and eight (2016: seven) operated under 
commercial free of tie leases. 
Our investment focus is to improve the 
quality of our core business and to seek 
high-quality, single-site acquisition 
opportunities within our heartland if they 
improve the overall business or reach 
new markets. We will pursue suitable 
opportunities outside our historic trading 
area, and are alive to opportunities to 
acquire small groups of pubs that meet 
our requirements, as evidenced by  
recent pub purchases. We are seeking  
to acquire sites with unique character  
in landmark or high-footfall locations, 
preferably with the potential for  
further development. 
During the last five years, we have 
acquired 22 pubs and disposed of 49.  
As a consequence of this, and investments 
in the core estate, the profile and quality 
of our pub estate have been transformed 
and, since 2012, the average EBITDAR per 
managed pub has increased by +30.5% 
and per tenanted pub by +25.4%.
This has been a year of record 
investments with total cash invested in 
new pub acquisitions of £24.8m (2016: 
£3.3m), in three separate transactions 
during the year.
First, at the start of the financial year,  
we announced an acquisition of eight 
freehold pubs in Kent, Surrey and Sussex 
from Ei Group plc. All these pubs continue 
to be operated by their existing licensees, 
except the Crown and Anchor, Shoreham 
by Sea which has transferred to the 
managed estate, and Earls, Maidstone 
which will transfer in the coming year.

Good progress in all areas of

underlying performance.

Simultaneously, we acquired UES and 
transferred the five pubs operated under 
tenancy by UES to the managed estate.  
We invested £12.9m in these two 
transactions in the year. 
Third, at the end of November 2016, we 
acquired VGR for £11.9m. VGR operated 
five very successful freehold pub 
restaurants in and around Maidstone and 
Ashford in the Company’s Kent heartland. 
All the pub restaurants are operated 
under the managed pub division. 
Since the year end, we have opened a 
new outlet in Chatham Maritime called 
Pier Five.
We have realised £5.9m of proceeds 
(2016: £11.9m) from the disposal of  
15 pubs (2016: 13) and two unlicensed 
properties (2016: seven). We continue  
to manage our property actively, aiming 
to dispose of those pubs which no longer 
fit our long-term strategy and to invest to 
maximise the potential of those that do.
Driving Footfall to our Pubs
We aim to drive footfall by designing and 
developing unique pubs and hotels with 
a ‘wow’ factor. We believe continuous 
investment in our facilities will attract  
and retain customers. In particular we 
continue to develop our accommodation 
business and exploit the growth in the 
local visitor economy. 
In addition to the new pub acquisitions 
we have invested £8.3m (2016: £7.3m) of 
capital expeniture in improving the look 
and feel of our pubs and £2.4m (2016: 
£2.2m) in repairs and decorations.
In the managed estate, major 
developments during this year have 
included £1.0m investment at the Minnis 
Bay Bar and Brasserie, £0.9m at the 
Ostrich, Colnbrook where 11 bedrooms 
have been added and the Manor Farm 
Barn, Southfleet. All these investments 
have transformed the outlets and the 
results have been encouraging.
In the tenanted estate we carried out 
major developments at a number of  
sites including the East Kent, Whitstable,  
the Plough, Farnham, the Old House  
at Home, Dormansland and the 
Sportsman, Seasalter.
Following the launch of our new brand 
identity, we have invested an additional 
£0.4m in the development of a new  
pub signage scheme and website with 
enhanced functionality and improved 
user experience. In conjunction with this 
we have improved all the photography 
on our pub microsites to bring out the 
character and individuality of each 
outlet. We intend to roll out the new 
signage scheme over the coming years. 
By the end of the summer, 45 schemes 
were completed. 
Developing our offer to enhance the 
customer experience
We aim to enhance the customer 
experience in our pubs by delivering 
great fresh food, providing 
accommodation of character and 
offering an interesting range of products. 
Our food continues to provide good 
growth in the business, in spite of intense 
competition in casual dining. Food sales 
now represent 33% (2016: 30%) of  
our managed turnover, with drinks 
representing 56% (2016: 58%) and 
accommodation 10% (2016: 11%).
We continue to build the food skills in  
our business and drive the quality of our 
offer. The acquisitions of both UES and 
VGR have brought fresh ideas and we 
have also enjoyed great success with 
new food offers at the Minnis Bay Bar 
and Brasserie and the Ship and Trades, 
Chatham Maritime. 
During the year we have refurbished  
37 rooms (2016: 35) and added 11 rooms 
at the Ostrich (2016: 4 rooms at the  
Ship & Trades) and now offer a total  
of 294 (2016: 283), all presented to a  
high standard.
Occupancy grew again from its record 
high last year to 79% (2016: 78%) whilst 
RevPAR continued to grow to £66  
(2016: £63). 
As the consumer becomes more willing 
to experiment across the drinks range  
we are always looking to innovate or 
introduce new concepts. We are 
constantly looking to introduce more 
premium products to strengthen our 
range and enhance the experience for 
our customers. 
Our beer offer has been greatly 
developed in the last two years.  
We are particularly excited about our 
emerging beer portfolio as we exploit  
the potential from our heritage brands 
and recent innovations. We have further 
expanded our range of premium local 
products, in particular gin, juices and 
English sparkling wine, and developed 
our range of mixers and fresh fruit 
cocktails. During the year our like-for-like 
drinks sales were +8.0% (2016: +3.1%).
Attracting, retaining and developing  
the best people
We aim to attract, retain and develop  
the best people by understanding the 
potential in everyone, inspiring them  
to achieve their goals and by building  
the loyalty and engagement of our 
licensees and employees through the 
professionalism of the support we provide.
I am particularly pleased with the 
progress we have made in recent years 
with our tenanted licensees. We again 
scored highly against a range of 
measures in an independent survey of  13 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 12 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017

Colnbrook, taking the total 
number in our managed  
estate to 294. We have also 
refurbished bedrooms at the 
Bell Hotel, Sandwich and the

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
pubs and companies, and, for the second 
year running, were finalists in the 
Publican Awards Best Tenanted and 
Leased Pub Company (201 + sites) and 
Best Managed Pub Company (51+ sites).
We have made great strides to develop 
our training and are rated by the BII as  
one of the top licensed trade training 
providers. All staff in the managed estate 
have personal development programmes; 
500 offline courses and 1,700 online 
courses have been delivered against 
these in the year. 
Our Love Beer programme to educate 
and inform all staff on beer and brewing 
has proved very successful and has 
driven an increased awareness and 
passion for beer across our business.
We continue to enhance the skills at head 
office in support of our licensees. In the 
last year we have expanded our food 
development and field training teams 
and reduced the number of pubs per 
district manager in the managed and 
tenanted estates to bring even more 
focus to their work.
The Shepherd Neame Pub Awards 
continue to recognise excellence and 
achievement. This year T ony and Shirley 
Pearson of The Belle Vue T avern, Pegwell 
Bay won the Pub of the Year. It is 
particularly pleasing that we now have 
three pubs listed in the T op 50 Gastropubs 
in the country. It is also encouraging that 
we seem able to attract and support 
innovative licensees with diverse offers. 
Tenanted and Managed Pub 
Performance
We have pursued a consistent strategy 
to invest in our pubs over a sustained 
period and this has resulted in a strong 
trading performance year after year.
Total divisional turnover in the managed 
estate grew by +26.2% (2016: +9.8%) 
including the impact of new acquisitions. 
Divisional underlying operating profit 
grew by +18.0% to £9.0m (2016 restated: 
£7.6m). Same outlet like-for-like sales 
grew by +8.1% (2016: +4.4%) with drinks 
+8.0% (2016: +3.1%), food +7.7% (2016: 
+4.2%) and accommodation +10.1% (2016: 
+11.7%). Average EBITDAR per managed 
pub grew by +1.8% (2016: +1.0%).
Margins were impacted in the managed 
estate by the cost pressures affecting all 
operators in the sector. The total inflation 
from business rates, national living wage 
and the apprenticeship levy was £0.2m in 
the year. Looking forward, these 
pressures will continue and this area of 
the business will require like-for-like 
growth of around +3-4% to cover these 
additional costs.
T otal divisional turnover in the tenanted 
and leased estate grew by +2.8% to 
£34.4m (2016: £33.5m) on 14 fewer 
outlets. Divisional underlying operating 
profit was £13.0m (2016 restated: £12.7m).  
Like-for-like EBITDAR per tenanted  
pub grew by +1.6% (2016: +2.7%).  
Average EBITDAR per tenanted  
pub grew by +5.6% (2016: +6.4%).
Brewing and Brands
The brewing and brands division has 
enjoyed a successful year, some exciting 
brand launches and the redevelopment 
of our brewhouse.
The strength of the Shepherd Neame 
offer is a wide portfolio of high-quality 
products that suits many different 
customer needs in an increasingly 
fragmented market. We have continued 
to outperform and have achieved 
impressive volume growth of +3.9% 
against a market of modest decline of 
-0.2% (Source: BBPA). The Whitstable 
Bay Collection has again performed well 
with growth of +20.5% (2016: +19.5%) 
and now represents 10% of our own beer 
excluding contract. The Spitfire range 
has returned to growth of +2.2%  
(2016: -3.7%) and represents 22%  
of own beer excluding contract. 
We have invested £0.7m in restoring the 
fabric and infrastructure of our historic 
site and completing the installation of the 
new mash tuns. In the coming year we are 
planning to instal a new labeller on our 
bottling line together with associated  
line improvements. 
As previously announced our licence to 
brew and sell Asahi Super Dry will 
terminate at the end of February 2018.  
The brand represented 23% of our  
total brewed volume at the year end. In 
anticipation of the end of this contract, 
we have carried out a strategic review of 
our beer business and operation on this 
site so as to mitigate much of its impact. 
Whilst we have investigated other licence 
partnerships, we no longer feel that this 
type of world lager fits our portfolio. 
Furthermore, we see considerable 
opportunity from our emerging  
portfolio as the consumer seeks 
premium British products. 
We anticipate that brewing volumes will 
reduce in the short-term. We believe it is 
the best strategy in the long term to 
allocate more of our limited capacity to 
build our own brands and focus on those 
parts of the market where we have a 
competitive advantage or a strong 
position. We have determined to 
modernise our plant, to drive cost 
efficiency, higher productivity and quality 
enhancements. We expect turnover in this 
division to fall in line with volume in the 
near term. We are taking appropriate 
action to streamline our management 
structure, reduce our overheads and 
operating costs accordingly. As a result of 
these changes a one-off exceptional cost 
is expected in 2018. Going forward we are 
targeting ongoing divisional underlying 
EBITDA of around £3.5m.
The consequence of these actions, 
following a period of transition, will be  
a smaller, higher quality brewing and 
brands business, producing great beers   |StrategicReport |  Governance |  Financial Statements |  Other Information
15 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 14 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
on an upgraded infrastructure, and 
creating strong brands that positions the 
business well for future opportunities. 
Creating demand and building 
awareness for our brands
We aim to create demand and build 
awareness for our brands by developing 
a range of distinctive beers, by instilling a 
passion for quality, and by having a great 
engagement with our customers. 
The brewhouse investment and renovation 
works have driven greater efficiency and 
ever higher standards of quality in our beers.
The marketing team have had a busy  
year as they have developed a very 
compelling and exciting new portfolio 
including the introduction of Cinque, Five 
Grain Premium Lager, and Orchard View,  
a cider made in collaboration with Aspall.
The new brand identity has been well 
received by consumers and we received 
an award for it at the prestigious Mobius 
Awards. Our products receive many 
plaudits and we won three gold medals 
at the British Bottlers Institute Awards, 
and one gold at the International 
Brewing Awards. 
The Whitstable Bay Collection continues 
to enjoy great success with increasing 
distribution and brand awareness. 
Whitstable Bay Red IPA was added to the 
range this year. Spitfire Gold and Spitfire 
Lager, The Lager of Britain, were new 
extensions to the Spitfire brand last year 
and have performed above expectations. 
We have continued to support a variety 
of local and customer events such as the 
Battle of Medway 350th Anniversary 
commemoration through sponsorship 
and marketing activity. 
To raise awareness of our new brands we 
opened a pop-up shop at Bluewater for 
the first time with considerable success. 
The store was named Store of the Week 
by Retail Week. 
Brewing and Brands Performance
Divisional turnover for the year was  
+4.4% at £59.8m (2016: £57.3m).  
Own beer volume excluding contract was 
216,000 barrels (2016: 208,000 barrels) 
and grew by +3.9% (2016: +0.3%). 
Divisional underlying operating profit  
was £1.6m (2016 restated: £1.6m), after 
having absorbed incremental costs of 
water recovery of £0.3m which we are 
working to mitigate now that the 
operation is maturing.
Investment Property
The Company owns £6.8m of investment 
property, revalued at June 2017. The 
principal land holding is the residual land 
at Queen Court, Ospringe. In 2016, 10 
acres of this holding were disposed of 
with planning permission for residential 
development. During 2017, the Company 
promoted two further sites in the local 
plan that we consider suitable for housing. 
These are complex and expensive sites to 
develop and both have been rejected at 
this stage, but we will revisit in due course 
should circumstances change. The rest  
of the land holdings will be held as 
agricultural farm land for the long term. 
The Company reviews all of its property 
holdings on a regular basis.
Current Trading
Since the start of the new financial year 
we have made steady progress, albeit 
with colder and unsettled weather 
compared to 2016. In the 10 weeks  
to 2 September 2017, same outlet 
like-for-like managed sales were up  
+1.5% (2016:+8.2%) and total own beer 
volume excluding contract was up +4.4%  
(2016: +1.2%). In the 9 weeks to 26 August 
like-for-like EDITBAR in the tenanted 
estate was up +0.6% (2016: +2.2%). 
Summary
This has been a good year for the 
Company. The underlying performance 
has been strong; there has been a high 
level of pub acquisition and brand 
activity; the quality of our operations 
continues to improve. 
The profile of our pub assets and brands  
is stronger than ever. Our investments  
in recent years have helped to build a 
high-quality and sustainable platform 
for the future. But the focus in the 
coming year is to continue the rate of 
investment in our core business, to 
consolidate the recent acquisitions and 
effect a smooth transition in the brewing 
and brands business.
We have good reason to be pleased with 
the strategic and financial performance 
this year.  Our investments in recent  
years have helped to build a high-quality 
and sustainable platform for the future. 
But the next twelve months present new 
challenges given the unprecedented  
cost headwinds that the sector is facing 
and signs that consumer income is  
being squeezed.
