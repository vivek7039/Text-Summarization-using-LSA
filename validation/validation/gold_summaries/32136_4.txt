SUMMARY OF POLICY AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
Shareholders approved the Remuneration 
Policy at the AGM in 201 4. As such, the 
Company is required to seek approval for 
the new policy at the AGM to be held on 
1 1 July 201 7 . Pages 58 to 65 provide the 
full details of the proposed policy. 
The Committee reviewed the senior 
remuneration framework during the year 
to ensure that it remains 'ﬁ t for purpose', 
providing an appropriate framework to 
fulﬁ l M&S's reward philosophy which is, in 
turn, designed to support and drive the 
business strategy . Changes proposed to the 
policy are minimal as the Committee felt 
the previously approved framework remains 
broadly appropriate. For transparency, the 
table below sets out an overview of the key 
areas of the policy.
MAIN FEATURES OF CURRENT POLICY
> Increases awarded 
are normally in line 
with those elsewhere 
in the business. 
Adjustments in 
excess of this may 
be made where the 
Committee deems 
it appropriate.
> Beneﬁ ts provided at 
a rate commensurate 
with the market and 
currently include 
a car or cash 
allowance, a driver, 
and life assurance 
plus other beneﬁ ts 
provided to all 
employees, including 
employee discount.
> Directors may 
participate in M&S's 
deﬁ ned contribution 
arrangement on the 
same terms as other 
employees, or receive 
a cash supplement 
in lieu of pension 
contributions. Cash 
alternative maximum 
is currently 25% of 
salary for other 
executive directors 
(30% for CEO).
> Maximum opportunity 
of 200% of salary.
> 50% of total bonus 
deferred into shares 
for three years.
> Measured against 
Adjusted Group PBT 
(currently 70% of 
award) and individual 
objectives.
> Clawback and malus 
provisions apply.
> Maximum award 
of 300% of salary.
> Performance 
measured against 
ﬁ nancial targets over 
a three-year period.
> Clawback and malus 
provisions apply.
> Fees reviewed 
annually.
> Comprise basic fee 
plus additional fee for 
extra responsibility of 
Board or committee 
chairman or Senior 
Independent NED.
> In addition, the 
Chairman may be 
entitled to the use 
of a car and driver.
POLICY CHANGE
> Salaries will be 
compared against 
appropriately-sized 
listed companies 
which may be outside 
of the FTSE 25-75 
detailed in the 
previous policy.
> No change. > For current executive 
directors, the 
maximum cash 
allowance will be 
limited to 25% of 
salary for all 
(including the CEO).
> For future 
appointments, the 
cash amount payable 
will be capped at 20% 
of salary for all.
> No change. > A two-year holding 
period post 
vesting will be 
introduced.
> Performance 
conditions may 
include quantiﬁ able 
non-ﬁ nancial/
strategic measures, 
with ﬁ nancial 
measures comprising 
at least 50% of awards.
> Fees will be 
compared against 
appropriately-
sized companies 
which may be outside 
of the FTSE 25-75 
detailed in the 
previous policy.
