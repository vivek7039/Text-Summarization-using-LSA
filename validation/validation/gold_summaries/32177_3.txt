03 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017
The Group delivered another robust 
performance in FY2017 . The sale of Debt 
Management, completed in March 2017 , 
has simpliﬁed and focused the Group 
on its two principal businesses, both 
of which performed well. Private Equity 
delivered very strong returns, driven 
by signiﬁcant portfolio earnings growth. 
Infrastructure continues to execute its 
updated strategy effectively, generating 
good returns with a strong pipeline of 
new business.
Market environment
FY2017 was dominated by unexpected 
political events, including the UK’s decision 
to leave the EU and the result of the US 
presidential election. These events created 
volatile conditions, but with supportive 
debt markets and high volumes of 
capital still seeking attractive investment 
opportunities in both Private Equity 
and Infrastructure, the market environment  
remains intensely competitive. Under these 
conditions, our permanent capital base, 
strong balance sheet and long-established 
business networks in our target sectors 
and geographies represent a distinct 
competitive advantage. They enable the 
Group to be agile and opportunistic while 
remaining focused on investment discipline 
and effective asset management.
Performance and dividend
The Group’s total return increased by 
93% to £1,592 million (2016: £824 million). 
Net asset value increased to 604 pence 
per share (31 March 2016: 463 pence) and 
our return on opening shareholders’ funds 
was 36% (2016: 22%). A strong market 
for realisations meant that we were, as 
anticipated, net divestors during FY2017 . 
We repaid our €331 million bond in March 
2017 and ended the year with a net cash 
balance of £419 million and liquidity of 
£1,323 million (31 March 2016: net cash of 
£165 million and liquidity of £1,352 million).
In recognition of the strong level of cash 
realisations (including the proceeds 
from the sale of our Debt Management 
business) and taking into account the 
strength of the investment pipeline, the 
Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend 
of 18.5 pence per share (2016: 16 pence 
per share) for FY2017 . This is made up 
of the balance of the base dividend 
(8 pence per share, after the 8 pence 
interim dividend paid in January 2017) 
and an additional ﬁnal dividend of 10.5 
pence per share. The total dividend for 
the year of 26.5 pence per share reﬂects 
the Board’s continuing conﬁdence in 
the Group’s future prospects and cash 
generation capability.
Board changes
I am pleased to welcome Stephen Daintith, 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of Rolls-Royce 
Holdings, who joined the Board on 
1 October 2016. Stephen brings ﬁnancial, 
operating and international experience 
across a range of relevant sectors, 
including consumer and digital, and has 
already made a strong contribution to the 
Board and its committees.
Martine Verluyten has decided not to 
seek re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting on 29 June 2017 . I would like to 
thank Martine for her valuable contribution 
since 2012 during a period of signiﬁcant 
transformation for the Group.
Outlook
We enter FY2018 with a capable and 
experienced team of investors, a strong 
balance sheet, a high performing 
portfolio of assets, a good pipeline 
of new investment opportunities and 
a broadened platform in Infrastructure 
with good growth prospects. I am 
conﬁdent that the Group will remain 
opportunistic but disciplined as we 
navigate what promises to be another 
year of signiﬁcant uncertainty.
