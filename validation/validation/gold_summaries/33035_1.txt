 Chief Executive’s statement
Ben Verwaayen, Chief Executive, explains that BT will create value for
shareholders by its passion for customer service, its focus on proﬁtable
growth and its commitment to broadband.
6 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
A year ago, I said that there were three main parts to
BT’s strategy. This year, I’m saying the same thing.
First, we have a passion for customers. Second, we
have broadband at the heart of BT – and BT at the
heart of broadband. Third, we have rigorous
ﬁnancial discipline.
By concentrating on these three priorities we can
continue to reward shareholders, drive down debt and
invest in the business – where it matters.
First and foremost, we are passionate about
customers. Every time we deal with a customer,
our goal is to deliver an excellent experience – an
experience which is simple, but also complete.
We are working to meet the needs that customers
have today. And we are innovating to meet the needs
they will have tomorrow.
This means getting ever closer to customers,
understanding their lifestyles and businesses,
establishing long-term relationships with them.
We are proud to serve individuals, families, small
or medium-sized businesses, and global corporations.
In the past year, our passion for customers has
delivered results. For example:
& consumers and businesses are now more satisﬁed
with the way we provide and repair their services,
as shown by our satisfaction surveys
& packages such as BT Together, which has
ten million residential customers, have been a major
success story. From June this year, BT Together will be
even simpler, making minute-by-minute charges for
evening and weekend calling a thing of the past
& we are the UK’s leading internet service provider
for small and medium businesses
& the order book for our solutions business is very
strong and orders worth £3.6 billion were taken during
the 2003 ﬁnancial year, including a major e1 billion
contract to manage Unilever’s worldwide
communications network for seven years
& we promised that our major European operations
would break even at the EBITDA level and, thanks to
our market success and efﬁciency programme,
we delivered
& new business revenues among wholesale
customers (other telecoms operators and internet
service providers) grew by 85% year on year
& and, very importantly, overall customer
dissatisfaction was signiﬁcantly down by 37% for the
company (against the target we set of 25%).
Broadband is the biggest opportunity for growth
in the communications market. It’s no exaggeration
to say that it will be as important to our future as
voice telephone calls were to our past. Broadband is
more than just another product. It is a whole new way
of communicating. It sparks off tremendous demand
and is growing at a rapid rate – connections having
increased almost fourfold in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Our record over the past year shows how we are
meeting this demand:
& at 31 March 2003, we had around 800,000 ADSL
(asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections, and we
are well on the way to reaching our target of one million
this summer BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 7
& two-thirds of the UK population is now connected
to an ADSL-enabled exchange, and our development
of new business models, coupled with technological
breakthroughs, could put 90% of the UK’s homes and
small businesses within reach of broadband services
within the next few years.
And as well as signing up customers, we are
moving quickly to offer them inspiring new services.
Our understanding of what customers want is growing
every day and we are making sure that the company
is able to provide it. For example, new broadband
services were launched, offering music – Dotmusic on
Demand, sport – Sportal on Demand, and education –
the BT Learning Centre.
Our third key priority is ﬁnancial discipline. We put
our heart into customer service, but also into a
rigorous approach to ﬁnance.
As the broadband record shows, we have to meet
the demands of our customers in a way that also serves
the interests of shareholders – in other words, it has
to be ﬁnancially responsible and sustainable.
Financial discipline is not the same thing as cost
savings. It’s about doing things smarter, raising the
bar, proving that it is possible to do more with less.
We did substantially reduce operating costs and,
in addition, we very carefully targeted our capital
expenditure, which was £2.4 billion during the 2003
ﬁnancial year, a 21% reduction on the previous year,
on a like-for-like basis.
We are investing to transform our network.
Equipment designed for 20th century services is
making way for a true 21st century network, delivering
the broadband, multimedia services that today’s
customers require. It will also deliver these services
in the way many of today’s customers now demand
them – for example enabling customers to conﬁgure
and adjust their services themselves.
In this network, we are creating a new engine for
growth; simultaneously offering lower operating costs
and higher performance.
These then are the priorities that we have been
focused on in the past year and that we will remain
focused on in the year ahead.
Our success will depend not just on making our
strategy work but on the way in which we make it work.
The new corporate identity that we unveiled at the
beginning of April 2003 deﬁnes the kind of company
we are now and need to be in the future.
Central to that new identity is a commitment to
be simple and complete in all we do. And that, in turn,
means living our brand values.
Being trustworthy means consistently delivering on
our promises. Helpful means listening and responding.
Being straightforward means keeping things simple
and clear, and inspiring means constantly working
to create new communications possibilities. And we
have to do everything with real heart – showing passion
and conviction.
Those values, of course, can only be lived through
people – and, of course, our strategy can only be
delivered by the teams of motivated people throughout
the business. It simply couldn’t happen without them.
They breathe life into it. They make it work. And I’d
like to thank them for their loyalty and their hard work.
