 Playtech has continued to execute its strategy  
to improve the quality of Group earnings and has  
made strategic progress in key growth areas.

PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
12 OVERVIEW: A POSITION OF 
STRENGTH IN THE INDUSTRY
I am pleased to report that Playtech enjoyed 
another year of operational success and as 
a result finds itself in a position of strength 
at the end of 2017. Despite headwinds 
in regulated revenue in H1 2017 and 
the disruptions in unregulated markets 
experienced in the second half of 2017, the 
strength of the underlying Playtech business 
was demonstrated by the 18% revenue 
growth for the Group at constant currency. 
Moreover, given the operational progress 
in our Playtech ONE Omni-channel offering 
reported in 2017, Playtech is in an important 
strategic position going in to 2018. The 
strength of the new Live and Sports offerings 
has delivered immediate results with new 
contract wins in Casino and Live and our 
first online sports book licensees for PBS 
following the restructuring of our sports 
division. Management believe that Playtech 
ONE is at equal strength across all key 
product verticals and will provide Playtech 
with a strategic advantage in winning new 
licensees in key regulated and regulating 
markets in coming years. 
A UNIQUE  
OFFERING
Omni-channel offers users a 
unique and seamless journey 
through technology and 
compliance tools.

technical changes and 
specific local requirements.

A TRACK RECORD  
OF GROWTH
We have a strong track record 
of growth across our business 
through a combination of 
organic growth and the 
acquisition of complementary 
businesses, technology  
and content.

HIGH SHAREHOLDER  
RETURNS
We are committed to returning 
value to shareholders, as 
evidenced by the strong 
compound growth in our 
regular dividends.
Read more on page 20
Importantly, the strength of our balance 
sheet and cash flows means Playtech can 
continue to invest in our proven approach 
in strategic, fast growing, markets in Europe 
and Latin America by delivering and running 
integrated online and retail solutions to the 
‘local heroes’ in these markets. It is these 
land-based operators that are best placed to 
lead the growth of the new online markets. 
This will continue to drive the improvement 
in the quality of earnings we saw in 2017, 
with regulated revenue now reaching 
54% of Group revenue in 2017 and set to 
continue to grow. Moreover, the growth of 
these important markets will also drive the 
geographical diversification of Playtech’s 
revenue base, an important strategic 
objective for management in 2018. 
Finally, we operate in a rapidly changing 
and dynamic industry and it is important that 
we continue to invest in the evolution of 
the Playtech technology and offering. The 
acquisition of BetBuddy in 2017 adds ever 
greater Responsible Gambling functionality 
to our platform, providing further support 
to licensees in developed markets that 
are facing increased responsibilities in 
compliance and regulation.  
Moreover, the launch of our new Gaming 
Platform as a Service (GPAS) and Marketplace 
represent the next stage of evolution of 
the Playtech platform, ensuring that it is 
Playtech’s technology which remains the 
architecture of the industry. 
REGULATION
Regulation continues to be one of the 
biggest influences in the gambling industry 
worldwide, shaping the growth in each 
territory. Playtech’s strategy has been to 
invest in regulated markets, through organic 
growth and acquisitions and this resulted in 
regulated gaming revenue increasing to 49% 
in 2017 from 42% in 2016. 
Given the growth experienced in mature 
regulated markets, such as the UK, Playtech’s 
strategy is to focus on investing in fast 
growing newly regulated or regulating 
markets. During the period, we concentrated 
on supporting the organic growth of our 
customers in Italy, Spain, Finland, Denmark, 
Mexico, Columbia and Romania. Moreover, 
our strategy of partnering with the leading 
retail brands in newly regulated markets 
continued as we became the first supplier  
to launch online casino in the Czech  
Republic with the expanding Fortuna  
brand in January 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT
13 REGULATION CONTINUED
The Playtech ONE Omni-channel offering is 
uniquely placed to support new and existing 
licensees in newly regulated markets.
Playtech provides all the capabilities across 
the gambling value chain from software and 
services to direct customer acquisition and 
marketing capabilities, offering a seamless 
platform across all gambling verticals and 
with customer entry points in retail and online. 
This makes Playtech the partner of choice 
for the leading land based operators that 
are best placed to lead the newly regulated 
online markets.
This was demonstrated post period end 
in January 2018 when Playtech signed an 
agreement to provide Sociedade de Apostas 
Sociais (SAS) with its new online sports book 
and online casino platform, all integrated 
through Playtech’s IMS player management 
system. SAS is majority owned by Santa 
Casa, Portugal’s national lottery provider,  
and the launch of an online casino and sports 
betting offering follows regulation of online 
gambling in Portugal in late 2016. 
In the second half of 2017 the Company 
experienced a slowdown in Malaysia due  
to changing market conditions. Our strategic 
position on Asia is unchanged. We operate 
a risk based approach where our legal and 
compliance teams are consistently reviewing 
the regulatory environment to ensure that our 
presence is commercially beneficial to the 
Group. As outlined at the trading update in 
November 2017 the Board and Management 
is focused on continuing to diversify its 
revenue base by investing in fast growing 
regulated and regulating markets in Europe 
and Latin America through organic growth 
and M&A. This strategy will continue to drive 
the growth in Playtech’s regulated revenue 
streams and will diversify the geographical 
make-up of our revenue base.
FUTURE MARKETS
Between 2018 and 2019 licensing  
regimes are expected to be introduced  
in major European countries including  
the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and 
some commentators expect significant 
steps forward in Germany. Playtech already 
has an agreement in place with national 
operator Holland Casino in the Netherlands 
and remains in discussions with potential 
customers in others. 
Latin America remains a key growth territory 
for online gaming. Mexico is now one of 
Playtech’s top five regulated markets, by 
player jurisdiction, following the growth 
of licensee Caliente. The strength of our 
operations in Latin America positions us well 
with the potential significant markets of Peru 
and Brazil currently reviewing regulations. 
In the US, the outcome of the judicial  
review on sports betting could represent  
a milestone towards the regulation of sports 
betting at a federal level. Currently, the 
limited regulation of online casino does not 
present a commercially beneficial opportunity 
for Playtech. However, we believe that 
the potential movement in sports betting 
regulation would represent an attractive 
opportunity given the unique strength  
of our Playtech BGT Sports offering. 
PLAYTECH ONE 
Although multi-channel approaches are 
common (same content across web, mobile 
and retail), Playtech’s unique approach to 
Omni-channel is based on one integrated 
CRM (the IMS). This single CRM across all 
product verticals and channels allows for a 
single customer profile, and therefore single 
customer experience. Central to this single 
customer experience is Playtech’s ability to 
offer integrated products in each vertical. 
Not only are these products integrated 
from a branding point of view, (e.g the Age 
of the Gods suite available online and in 
retail across Live, Bingo and Casino), to 
drive player interaction across verticals, but 
also integrated in their use and collection 
of player data – allowing for more tailored, 
and successful, marketing and player cross-
sell. Playtech is uniquely positioned given 
the scale of its platform, the capabilities and 
access to data that scale provides. Playtech 
ONE creates an ecosystem for operators 
supporting a data driven offering that 
improves the engagement with customers 
significantly within the ecosystem maintaining 
their loyalty to operator brands. 
Playtech believes that retail is one of the 
most powerful bet entry points for customers 
and our strategy in recent years has been 
to invest in industry leading retail software 
capabilities across all verticals. IGS, retail 
casino software, ECM, the retail Bingo 
software and BGT as part of Playtech BGT 
Sports allow land-based operators to capture 
retail player traffic as part of the Playtech 
ONE ecosystem. 
IMS – THE PLAYTECH PLATFORM
One of the most powerful elements of 
Playtech ONE is the use of the data collected 
across the breadth of the verticals and 
channels. Key to our strategy is the continued 
development of the functionality of the 
Playtech platform as we continue to utilise  
the player data and intelligence collated  
via the IMS. 
As the gambling market continues to 
mature, the focus for operators in developed 
markets such as the UK continues to move 
beyond player acquisition to focus on player 
retention and ultimately increasing player 
life time value. The platform allows for 
industry standard bonusing, together with 
more sophisticated mechanics, including 
automated cashback, free-spins, golden 
chips for table and card games and other 
types of bonuses. All these promotional 
methods can be controlled and configured 
by the operator, allowing for stringent liability 
and monetary control. Games Advisor is a 
real-time driven recommendation engine 
based on sophisticated real time algorithms 
that suggests other games the player 
might be interested in with high probability, 
dependent on many game-specific variables, 
including volatility, win hit frequency and 
win distribution. During the second half 
of 2017 we have seen the number of Tier 
One licensee active marketing campaigns 
managed through the Playtech Campaign 
Manager more than double to over 4,000 
active campaigns with some managing 
hundreds in parallel. 
The acquisition of BetBuddy, the Responsible 
Gambling analytics solution provider, 
represents a continuation of Playtech’s 
strategy to acquire complimentary software 
that will utilise the big data collated via the 
IMS and add to the industry leading services 
available to operators on Playtech’s platform. 
Furthermore in 2017 Playtech signed a 
strategic partnership with Featurespace 
to integrate its real-time gameplay fraud 
detection models into the IMS’ already 
considerable player protection tool kit. 
GPAS & MARKETPLACE
GPAS (Gaming Platform as a Service) 
provides the next step in Playtech’s 
relationship with licensees, content providers 
and developers. Third parties can use the 
Playtech’s drag and drop maths engine to 
build high quality HTML5 games or submit 
their own existing content for distribution 
across Playtech’s global network on any 
channel. GPAS content can be seamlessly 
developed for retail and online, whereas 
traditionally converting popular online 
games into retail games was expensive and 
inefficient involving two sets of technology 
and two sets of developers.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONT.
PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
14 Management believe GPAS will provide  
a strategic advantage for Playtech’s Omni-
channel approach in newly regulated fast 
growing markets, as integrated content 
across retail and online can help facilitate the 
player journey across channels and will also 
provide our customers with more flexibility 
allowing them to develop bespoke games  
to support their promotions.
Marketplace is Playtech’s new content 
discovery platform where operators can 
access Playtech’s portfolio of content. As 
new content providers or partners develop 
games on GPAS, they will be able to place 
their games onto the Marketplace, gaining 
immediate access to all Playtech’s distribution 
network. Our goal is for Marketplace to 
become a games store that is based on 
and driven by data that will automatically 
determine the relevance of games to 
different customer’s demographics.
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION
The period saw revenue from the top ten 
licensees stand at 55% compared to 54% 
for full year 2016. Revenue from the top five 
licensees remained consistent on the full year 
period at 36% and 37% of revenue in 2016 and 
2017 respectfully. This was the first full year 
period where the consolidation, and ultimately 
increased scale and growth, of key licensees 
such as Ladbrokes Coral was included. In 
addition, this was the first full year period where 
the large revenue contributing Sun Bingo 
related white-label contract was included.
M&A
As outlined above, the acquisition of 
BetBuddy for an undisclosed fee in October 
2017 was an important acquisition. The 
integration of BetBuddy’s behavioural 
identification and modification software into 
Playtech’s powerful IMS player management 
system will enable Playtech to continue 
to lead the industry in the delivery of 
Responsible Gambling products and services.
In February 2017 Playtech completed the 
acquisition of Eyecon, a specialist supplier 
of online gaming soft slots, and a bingo slots 
specialist software for an initial consideration 
of £25 million (€29 million). The acquisition 
of Eyecon is a further example of Playtech 
executing its Omni-channel solution through 
earnings accretive M&A. Eyecon is a soft casino 
slot provider specialising in games for the 
Bingo market. Eyecon deepens the content 
offering in the Bingo vertical ultimately helping 
to drive revenue across verticals as well as 
allow us to also extend to retail. The acquisition 
strengthens Playtech's Bingo distribution 
network whilst offering industry leading  
games content.
Given the Company position and strong 
balance sheet it remains opportunistic and 
acquisitive. It does however remain disciplined 
and takes measured steps to ensure the 
opportunities are in line with our stated M&A 
strategy and present growth opportunities 
beyond cost synergies which are important  
but not the essence of our approach. 
GAMING DIVISION PERFORMANCE 
BY VERTICAL
GAMING B2B
The new presentation of Gaming revenue by 
vertical is explained fully in the CFO section. 
Gaming B2B includes software and services 
revenues, while Gaming B2C includes white-
label gaming operations in regulated markets, 
such as Sun bingo and casual games.
CASINO
Casino revenue grew 11% from 2016 to 2017 
and 15% at constant currency. Despite the 
headwinds in Asia in H2 2017 the growth 
was driven by the organic growth of existing 
licensees with growth excluding acquisitions 
of 12% at constant currency.
The pillars of Playtech’s future growth 
strategy are reflected in the operational 
achievements reported in our Casino vertical 
as we continued to support the organic 
growth of our core regulated markets.  
In Europe in 2017 Playtech launched 45 
new games in Italy, 75 in Spain, 90 in Czech 
Republic, 71 in Bulgaria and 51 in the UK. 
Importantly, following the ‘de-coupling’ of 
Playtech’s Casino games from the platform 
that formed part of the platform overhaul 
reported at the interim results in August 2017, 
Playtech is now able to launch new content 
seamlessly across all regulated markets, 
allowing licensees to deliver global marketing 
campaigns for branded content.
In November Playtech announced the launch 
of exclusive online Casino agreement with 
leading Spanish operator Casino Barcelona, 
in addition to online casino the agreement 
saw Casino Barcelona join Playtech’s Spanish 
iPoker.es network. 
Content & Studios
In 2017 Playtech completed the unification 
of its games studios onto our agile 
games development platform content 
and distribution strategy. Playtech now 
operates eight games studios worldwide, 
all with proven pedigrees and collectively 
providing unparalleled knowledge and 
experience in online casino games creation. 
The studios are now applying the new 
SAS – NEW

CLIENT
SOCIEDADE DE APOSTAS 
SOCIAIS (SAS), PORTUGAL’S 
LARGEST REGULATED

In February 2018 Playtech signed a 
landmark deal landmark deal to supply 
Sociedade de Apostas Sociais (SAS), 
Portugal’s largest online gaming and 
betting operator, with its cutting-edge 
IMS player management platform  
and new sportsbook offering.
SAS is one of the first operators to 
launch such a wide range of online 
products following the country 
regulating gaming and betting  
18 months ago.
 
The multi-year agreement will see  
Playtech integrate its award-winning  
data-driven IMS player management 
platform and single wallet functionality  
into SAS’s operation, powering its entire 
online offering.
The Playtech BGT Sports (PBS) digital 
offering is a single, integrated solution 
for both desktop and mobile devices 
containing a state-of-the-art interface 
that will enable SAS customers to bet 
on the move or at home.
With a focus on simple navigation and 
in-play betting, the mobile solution 
meets the needs of all online bettors 
and maximises operator margins.
PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
15 Playtech content pillars to game production; 
Signature (individual style of the studio), 
Reach (relevance to market), Reliability 
(stable games and publication dates) and 
Value (largest Jackpots, bonusing tools, 
engagement tools). This unified approach 
to rapid Omni-channel game deployment 
enables operators seeking differentiation  
and customisation to integrate bespoke 
games in record time and under budget. 
Given the size and scale of Playtech’s 
distribution platform we are in an unrivalled 
position to be able to develop branded 
content as a cornerstone of our portfolio of 
over 600 games. The first half of 2017 saw 
Playtech sign an industry first agreement 
with DC Comics to provide a full suite of DC 
branded games including the Man of Steel, 
Classic Superman and Batman and Suicide 
Squad slot titles. The DC agreement was 
the culmination of a strategic project in the 
second half of 2016 designed to replace 
the Marvel studios content in the Playtech 
portfolio. Playtech had a long and successful 
relationship with Marvel studios and this 
ended in 2016 following Marvel’s acquisition 
by Disney and a change of licensing 
approach from the acquirer. 
The second half of 2017 saw Playtech 
complete an industry first for gaming content 
by completing the synchronised launch of the 
DC Justice League slot game in conjunction 
with the launch of the Hollywood film 
available to licensees across all regulated 
markets. Moreover 2017 saw Playtech further 
grow its portfolio of branded games by 
launching the American Dad, The Matrix, 
RoboCop, Monty Python's Holy Grail and  
Dirty Dancing titles.
In addition to the global branded content 
strategy for slot games the breadth of our 
games development capabilities allows 
Playtech to launch territory specific games 
and content. The second half of 2017 saw 
the successful launch of slot game Torrente 
for the Spanish market. Moreover, Playtech’s 
own Age of the Gods suite of games 
continues to go from strength to strength with 
its games titles in the top rankings of popular 
games for all our licensees. The latest game 
in the series, God of Storms, experienced a 
highly successful launch in 2017. The Age of 
the Gods suite is the end result of thorough 
research that was based on big data analysis 
designed to improve the probability of 
success of the games. 
Live Casino
This year saw Playtech complete the full 
migration of existing Live Casino rooms 
to the new market leading facility in Riga. 
This has enabled Playtech to drive product 
innovation in Live with new concepts, games 
and features. Driven by the powerful Playtech 
IMS player management platform and data-
driven business intelligence technology, 
Playtech Live Casino is fully integrated into 
the Playtech platform and Casino offering. 
Playtech Live Casino therefore delivers 
greater cross-sell opportunities through a 
seamless user experience from slots to Live 
table games in conjunction with industry first 
branded Live games and pooled jackpot 
experiences.  
The quality of our Live Casino offering was 
reflected in the progress we made with 
licensees in the key vertical in 2017. The 
completion of the migration to the new Riga 
facility saw Playtech re-imagine and design  
all dedicated areas for our leading customers, 
this resulted in Tier 1 Live Casino customers 
renewing existing agreements for long 
term deals, such as Sky in July 2017, and 
increasing the number of dedicated tables 
hosted in our studio. Moreover, we saw new 
commitments for dedicated tables in the 
second half of the year from Betfred and BGO 
Entertainment and launched new licensees 
Sports Interaction and Stoiximan in Greece  
at the end of 2017. 
Importantly as part of the Tier 1 renewal 
process, and in line with the Group’s growth 
strategy, Playtech Live Casino secured 
new territory launches for Tier 1 licensees 
including the launch of Live Casino on 
Sky Bet’s ‘Sky Italy’ gaming sites. The 
sophistication and success of the new Live 
offering was reflected with Sky Bet’s success 
in winning the eGaming Review Innovation in 
Casino award for its new Playtech supplied 
Live Casino. Sky Bet went live with its new 
state of the art dedicated Live Casino 
environment in April 2017 and won the award 
for offering players an enhanced Omni-
channel experience, product enhancements 
and richer gameplay.
PLAYTECH BGT SPORTS (PBS)
Revenue in Sports for 2017 saw an increase 
on 2016 of 58% at constant currency. This 
was due to the contribution from BGT, the 
retail Sports software provider acquired by 
Playtech in July 2016. Underlying revenue 
excluding acquisitions at constant currency 
declined compared to 2016 mainly due to  
the absence of the Mobenga contracts which 
came into effect at the end of H1 2016.
A key strategic milestone in 2017 has 
been the launch and the completion of 
the integration of Playtech BGT Sports 
(PBS). PBS brings together Playtech Sports 
companies BGT, Geneity, Mobenga, Unilogic 
and Playtech’s internal Sports Trading team. 
In 2017 PBS completed a considered and 
strategic integration combining the best of 
technology and modules from the Playtech 
Sports companies and delivering the 
industry’s first integrated retail and online 
sports betting platform. PBS will provide a 
‘bricks-to-clicks’ fully integrated sports betting 
technology solution based on Playtech ONE, 
offering single-betting accounts across the 
web, mobile, self-service betting terminals 
(SSBTs) and over the counter (OTC) in retail 
betting shops. 
PBS believes there is significant opportunity 
for SSBT growth globally and has seen the 
number of active retail machines increase 
37% from c.27,000 in December 2016 
to c.37,000 in December 2017. With the 
completion of the integration of the PBS 
retail software to the Playtech ONE platform 
the size of the retail machine footprint offers 
significant opportunities for the cross sell  
of PBS’ integrated offering.
Along with the completion of the PBS 
integration the Sports division has 
concentrated on growing its retail and  
online customer base in the key fast growing 
markets in Europe and Latin America, in 
line with the Group level strategy. Early in 
the period PBS announced a three-year 
agreement with OPAP, the leading Greek 
betting and lottery operator, for the supply  
of SSBTs, relevant software and services, 
and the introduction of an OTC sports betting 
solution. The second half of 2017 saw PBS 
solution go live across the 4,500 estate with 
over four thousand OTC tills and over 1,500 
SSBTs active by the end of the period.

PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
16 PLAYTECH BGT SPORTS 
INTEGRATION, INNOVATION, 
DISRUPTION
This year, 2017 was a challenging and 
important year. We had the challenge of 
integrating four different Sportsbetting 
platforms across seven different countries 
into one division – Playtech BGT Sports. 
Our plan was to take the best of 
technology stack and modules across 
the different companies and form an 
integrated PBS Sportsbetting platform 
across retail and online, whilst at the same 
time delivering growth and maintaining  
our advantage in the existing retail  
Sports offering. 
Our vision is to change the way that 
bookmakers think about sportsbetting by 
delivering a ‘bricks-to-clicks’ fully integrated 
Sportsbetting technology solution based 
on Playtech ONE the unique Omni-channel 
platform. From digital SSBTs and OTC in 
retail to mobile, web and tablet. 
Altogether Playtech BGT Sports aims to 
form the leading Sportsbetting Technology 
Powerhouse of the industry. 
In line with Group strategy we delivered 
important geographical expansion in 
strategically important territories, such 
as Germany, Spain, Italy, Columbia and 
Mexico. Moreover, my goal was to deliver 
the new PBS platform to one of Europe’s 
largest Lottery and Sports operators  
OPAP in 2017. This was our biggest  
client project in 2017.
Key to maintaining our strategic position 
in sports is innovation of our products and 
we introduced new exclusive content and 
innovations across all our product lines: 
Self Service, Till and Digital Applications. 
I am proud to report that the PBS 
management team and all our fabulous 
employees our vision within the last 12 
months. Thank you to all our passionate 
PBS employees that are coming on 
this journey with us to change the way 
operators think about Sportsbetting. 
Dr Armin Sageder
CEO Playtech BGT Sports
In addition to OPAP, 2017 saw PBS launch 
SSBTs with customers in Malta, Romania, 
Spain, Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. 
As outlined at the interim results in August 
2017, alongside Europe a key focus for 
the PBS SSBT product was growth in Latin 
America and the second half of 2017 saw  
PBS install a first phase SSBT programme  
in Columbia with Codere and Sportium.
The second half of 2017 also saw an 
important strategic milestone in the launch  
of PBS’ first integrated online and retail 
sports book customers with German operator 
HpyBet and Belgian Magic Betting. In 
addition, the post period end signing of an 
integrated online sports book and casino 
platform with the biggest gambling brand 
in Portugal, SAS, was another important 
strategic win for the new sports division.
Key contracts have been renewed with 
Betfred and Paddy Power Betfair with both 
secured until at least 2020 and with Betfred 
taking another 500 terminals and Paddy 
Power shops installing a minimum of 800 
new terminals over the next 12 months. 
Playtech’s strategy in Sports is to continue to 
drive product development to retain operator 
and customer engagement with retail. In 
H1 2017, PBS launched its revolutionary 
Retail Mobile App named ‘Bet Tracker’. Bet 
Tracker went live with Betfred in August 2017 
and Jennings Bet, Boyles and Plucks will 
also followed later in 2017. The Bet Tracker 
product is leading the digitilisation of the 
retail sports experience, allowing customers 
to track their bets placed in store on their 
mobile phones without already having a 
mobile account, giving operators increased 
touch points with their customers. In addition, 
2017 saw PBS become the first retail provider 
to deliver Lottoland’s jackpot lotto betting 
products on SSBTs located in licenced 
betting shops.
 
Moreover, PBS’ integration into Playtech’s 
IMS platform has allowed PBS to build in 
the same data tools and functionality that is 
available across the Playtech ONE platform. 
In line with the Group’s strategy to deliver 
Responsible Gambling tools to support 
licensees PBS has agreed a development 
roadmap with the UK Gambling Commission 
to deliver Anti Money Laundering and Fraud 
prevention identification tools across the 
retail and online platform.

STRATEGIC REPORT
17 SERVICES
The increase in contribution from the white-
label offering meant the transition in services 
from dot com to regulated revenue streams 
continued in the period resulting in a higher 
proportion of regulated revenues for this 
vertical. As part of the natural transition 
from unregulated to regulated markets our 
services division is now focused on different 
partners in regulated markets where we 
see real momentum in activity. In Mexico, 
our partner Caliente is going from strength 
to strength and we continue to experience 
significant growth. In Spain, we see good 
momentum from our local partners and 
expect it to continue rapidly growing in the 
coming years. We have made real progress 
in other markets such as the UK, Italy and in 
line with our overall strategy and focus on 
regulated markets our services division will 
extend its reach into other regulated markets 
such as Portugal, Colombia and others.
 
BINGO
Following the acquisition of Bingo software 
and services supplier ECM in October 2016 
the Bingo vertical saw a 47% increase in 
revenue at constant currency in 2017. 
 
The Bingo vertical remains a key customer 
acquisition channel at the operator level. 
Playtech’s Bingo offering allows licensees 
to offer seamless cross-sell and movement 
between channels and verticals, but more 
importantly Bingo slot and Casino integrated 
content. The integration of retail software 
and services supplier ECM, onto the Playtech 
Bingo platform has created an ecosystem 
for licensees to retain players regardless 
of channel or vertical. Omni-channel, 
integrated content, such as Tiki Paradise, 
allows operators to drive player traffic to 
other verticals and importantly track the 
behavioural analytics across those channels 
and verticals. Post period end in January 
2018 Playtech announced it had launched the 
popular online game Clover Rollover across 
128 Gala Bingo UK retail sites meaning the 
game was now available online, in retail and 
on mobile. 
POKER
Poker remains an important part of the 
complete Playtech ONE product offering and 
Playtech continues to offer the largest open 
and ‘tappable’ poker network in the industry. 
Although the wider online Poker market 
remains challenging Playtech’s poker vertical 
returned to growth in 2017 with revenue 
increasing 7% at constant compared to  
2016, this follows a consistent slowing  
of the decline in the last few years.
OTHER
Other revenues grew 48% to €26.4 million 
as our retail Casino software, the IGS land-
based Casino system management system 
received new orders across the Rank estate 
and across the eight landmark Caesars 
Entertainment EMEA casino portfolio. 
B2C GAMING 
The new disclosure shows a new line item 
called B2C Gaming which include white-label, 
B2C and Casual.
WHITE-LABEL AND B2C
The contract with News UK for Sun 
Bingo continues to see improvement in 
revenue although it remains challenging. 
As a reminder, although the migration of 
Sun Bingo in 2016 was successful from 
a technological perspective there were 
challenges migrating all of the VIPs. Changes 
were then made in Q2 2017 which has 
led to some improvement in KPIs and 
performance. However, given that Bingo 
is very much a UK business which is also 
seasonal, management believes that the full 
benefit of the changes made were offset 
by exceptionally good weather combined 
with the UK summer holidays. Sun Bingo 
revenue improved towards the end of 
the year with a successful promotion just 
before Christmas, with the start of 2018 
showing some continued momentum. It is 
worth remembering that there is significant 
operating leverage within the Sun Bingo 
contract due to minimum guarantees payable 
to News UK which means that as revenues 
increase, the benefit will drop straight 
through to the bottom line. As stated above, 
despite the improvement, the Sun Bingo 
contract remains challenging. Playtech is 
in discussions with News UK following a 
thorough analysis of the issues encountered 
with the contract. 
Revenue from other white-label and B2C 
contracts declined to €22.8 million.
CASUAL
Casual games continued to enjoy revenue 
growth driven by the ongoing success  
of the Narcos branded game.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONT.
TRADETECH GROUP –
PLAYTECH’S FINANCIAL DIVISION
TradeTech Group achieved key 
milestones in 2017, delivering both 
significant organic growth as well as 
successful acquisitions which together are 
providing the foundation for future growth, 
in line with the strategic vision at Playtech 
Group level. The strong financial results 
reflect the significant improvement and 
progress we have made last year.
The division reported significant growth 
on reported results and importantly 
when excluding acquisitions and on a 
proforma (assuming ACM assets acquired 
from beginning of financial year) basis, 
delivering Adjusted EBITDA growth across 
each of the different business segments, 
with organic growth in Adjusted EBITDA 
of 44% after excluding acquisitions, 
and an impressive 58% growth on a 
proforma basis, after considering all of the 
acquisitions during the period and their 
historic underlying performance. 
As can be seen from the results, 
TradeTech has delivered significant 
margin improvement of the underlying 
business following efficiencies and cost 
reductions made toward the end of 2016 
year and the beginning of 2017. In addition, 
results in 2017 were negatively impacted 
by the crypto ‘hype’ experienced in the 
year, predominantly in Q4, resulting in a 
total loss of $7.6 million from our top line, 
affecting both the B2C segment as well  
as B2B.
REGULATION IN THE  
FINANCIAL TRADING SECTOR
Playtech management and the Board 
believe that TradeTech is well placed 
to benefit from the potential regulatory 
changes the industry could experience in 
2018. Management believe that TradeTech 
has significant experience, governance 
procedures and balance sheet to continue 
to support regulation and remain both 
commercial and compliant. Our experience 
of new regulatory frameworks learned in 
the Gaming division prompted TradeTech  
to be an early adopter of new regulation.
On January 18 2018, as part of its ‘call 
for evidence’ the European Securities 
and Markets Authority, ESMA, proposed 
measures to restrict the marketing, 
distribution and sale of CFDs to retail clients.

ACQUISITION
In October 2017 Playtech agreed the 
acquisition of Responsible Gambling software 
specialist BetBuddy for an undisclosed fee. 
The addition of BetBuddy’s machine learning  
and Artificial Intelligence software into 
Playtech’s data driven IMS platform  
will deliver an innovative Responsible  
Gambling solution to operators globally. 
Playtech’s strategy is to acquire complementary 
technology which extends its software and 
services offering to the gambling industry’s 
leading operators. The integration of 
BetBuddy’s behavioural identification and 
modification software into Playtech’s powerful 
IMS player management system will enable 
Playtech to continue to lead innovation in the 
delivery of Responsible Gambling products  
and services.
The integration will deliver an industry leading 
Responsible Gambling player management 
platform and will give Playtech's licensees 
the opportunity to offer their players a safer 
environment in which to enjoy Playtech’s  
Omni-channel products, features and 
functionality. The acquisition will ensure the 
Playtech platform will be well placed to navigate 
the continually evolving global regulatory 
challenges around Responsible Gambling in 
online and retail markets.
Playtech trialled Bet Buddy’s analytics software 
earlier in 2017, using its algorithms to detect  
‘at risk’ behaviours. The addition of the 
BetBuddy team and methodologies to Playtech’s 
data driven approach will allow Playtech to take 
the next step in evolving its gambling content 
to ensure it is developed and deployed in a 
sustainable manner.
While these are still proposals for changes 
in regulations, we believe TradeTech is 
well positioned in the market following 
implementation of such proposals or 
other changes as they may come into 
effect. It is important to note that some 
of the proposed changes are already 
implemented as part of our existing 
business model, including negative 
balance protection and restriction of  
use of bonuses and other incentives  
for trading. 
MARKETS.COM PERFORMANCE
Our B2C business operating our Markets.
com brand enjoyed significant growth 
on both first-time depositors and active 
customers, with 43% growth in actives 
and 93% in FTDs. This fundamental 
improvement and momentum in the 
B2C business is driven by a significant 
improvement in the cost per acquisition 
of $870 in 2017, on the back of continued 
development of our automated marketing 
capabilities.
As noted above, the crypto ‘hype’ in 2017 
had a material impact on our B2C top line 
performance, which together with very 
low volatility on other asset classes in Q4 
resulted in an overall underperforming 
fourth quarter. However, it is important 
to acknowledge the steady growth in 
actives which we believe will continue 
in 2018 and which will be translated 
into higher revenues and profits going 
forward. Outside the crypto ‘hype’ 
effect and low Q4 volatility, volume has 
remained relatively stable, on the back 
of regulatory changes related to default 
leverage limitation and elimination of 
incentive bonuses introduced at the 
beginning of 2017. Importantly 2017 saw 
strong continuity in our relationships with 
our B2C customers. Approximately 62% 
of revenue was generated from existing 
customers onboarded prior to 2017, further 
strengthened by the fact that the majority 
of revenues are generated from customers 
trading for more than 1 year, with 28% from 
customers trading for more than 2 years. 
These measures reflect the continuous 
investment in improving the quality of 
services we offer to our customers, with 
further development of ‘decision support’ 
tools and capabilities to aide customers in 
identifying trading opportunities. 
These include our real time “Trending 
now” feature, “Traders trends” live 
disclosure per asset, “Events & trade” 
financial calendar, “Market consensus” 
analysts integrated portal and more. 
TRADETECH GROUP  
B2B RESULTS
In the B2B business 2017 also saw 
significant growth on reported results, 
excluding acquisitions and on a proforma 
basis. TradeTech’s B2B segment is now 
servicing over $1 trillion in volume from 
B2B customers, and over $1.3 trillion on  
a proforma basis after adding Alpha’s pre-
acquisition volumes in 2017. These results 
show a healthy link between revenues and 
volume, with a steady revenue generation 
on the back of increase in volume from 
customers from the three sub-segments  
of our B2B offering.
TradeTech management believe these 
results demonstrate the execution of 
Playtech’s B2B strategy to become 
the provider of choice to brokers in 
the financial trading industry. The CFH 
and TradeTech Alpha acquisitions 
complimented our existing frontend and 
backend technology and enabled us to 
deliver an end to end solution for brokers, 
enabling them to enjoy a full suite of 
products from a unique trading platform 
and CRM systems, to liquidity control, 
risk management capabilities, real time 
risk applications and more. TradeTech’s 
strategy is to continue to establish its 
capabilities across the entire value chain  
in the financial trading sector.
