At the end of the year we initiated a small 
share buy-back programme, which 
concluded in January 2018 with the total 
purchase of 260,384 shares at a cost 
of £249,445. These shares are held in an 
Employee Benefit Trust to cover potential 
exercises of vested share options thus 
reducing the dilutive effect of issuing new 
shares. Based on the number of vested 
options and the share price at the time, this 
was a sensible use of capital for the benefit 
of all shareholders. 
Outlook
The Group has a strong platform from 
which to deliver the next phase of growth. 
The economic conditions are positive and 
whilst we maintain a cautious view on 
political risk, we see good opportunities 
to develop our Group further during the 
year ahead. We have a proven strategy 
and brands that have the potential to grow 
their profit.
