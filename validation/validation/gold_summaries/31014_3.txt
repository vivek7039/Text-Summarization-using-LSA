CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS  
This is my first report as Chairman, having assumed the role after 
the 2017 AGM. Undoubtedly, 2017 has been a year of considerable 
progress for Anglo Pacific with record royalty revenue, two 
successful transactions and an increase in the dividend whilst 
repaying our borrowings in full. We enter 2018 in a strong financial 
position and with an exciting pipeline for growth, which is the clear 
focus for the year ahead.  
KE Y RESULT S
06 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
APG_AR17_28.03.18_FRONT_ARTWORK PERFORMANCE IN 2017
Our royalty income in 2017 increased by 90% from £19.7m to 
£37.4m, continuing the trend of recent years, and representing 
a record year for the Company. This was primarily due to a 
significant increase in volumes from Kestrel being subject to 
the Group’s royalty (93% in 2017 vs 67% in 2016) in addition  
to higher coal prices. Commodity prices exceeded most 
commentators’ expectations at the beginning of 2017, with 
the average price achieved at Kestrel being some 30% higher 
than the previous year. Thermal coal and vanadium prices 
were also strong which contributed to the Group’s record 
performance. We have also enjoyed income from the Denison 
investment for the first time. 
The higher commodity prices and revenues during 2017 
translated directly into higher profits and cash generation. 
Operating profit increased to £28.4m from £12.7m in 2016. 
Operating costs also increased in the period due to a 
combination of higher staff costs and a greater level of 
investment in business development as we target a higher 
rate of growth in the coming year.
Our results were, as usual, impacted by a number of 
revaluation adjustments which led to overall profit before tax 
being £11.8m compared to £28.3m in 2016, the decline being 
driven in the main by the valuation of the Kestrel royalty.  
Basic and diluted earnings per share were 5.88p compared 
with 15.60p in 2016. Stripping out these non-cash items,  
we present an adjusted earnings measure (refer to note 11  
to the accounts) which, we believe, more closely reflects the 
performance within management’s control. On this basis 
adjusted earnings per share were 16.82p (2016: 9.76p). 
DIVIDENDS
In light of the strong results in 2017, and the strength of our 
dividend cover, the Board has recommended that the final 
dividend be increased by 1p per share (subject to approval by 
shareholders at the 2018 AGM), which will result in an overall 
dividend for the year of 7p per share. We have also increased 
the level of the interim dividend payments from 1.5p to 
1.625p, which will be reflected in the Q1 2018 dividend.  
We believe that these levels strike the right balance between 
offering shareholders an attractive dividend yield and 
retaining sufficient resources to drive the growth strategy. 
FOCUS FOR 2018
Given the strong financial position that we now enjoy, and  
the positive outlook for the sector, we are focused on 
accelerating the growth of our asset base in the coming years. 
We wish to increase the diversity of our portfolio such that it 
includes a wider range of commodities and assets, thereby 
reducing the percentage of our income coming from coal, and 
Kestrel in particular. We have also announced a desire to build  
a meaningful presence in commodities which are focused on  
the growing electric vehicle market, where we see great 
potential. Our investment in 2017 in the Piauí nickel project is  
an example of this focus combined with our strategy of 
looking to add pre-production royalties which will offer high 
return potential over the years. Our principal objective, 
however, remains the acquisition of producing or near 
production royalty and streaming assets.
The team continues to be very disciplined in ensuring that 
acquisitions are of the highest quality in terms of project 
characteristics both technically and commercially and that we 
design transaction structures to optimise risk management.
CORPORATE CULTURE AND GOVERNANCE
Anglo Pacific seeks to maintain the highest standards in  
all areas of its business. I believe this starts at the top.  
We broadened the agenda at our annual strategy day in 2017  
to include sessions on strategy, including corporate social 
responsibility, risk and board effectiveness. These sessions 
were primarily facilitated by industry experts who brought  
an objective and impartial insight as to how the Board 
approaches these areas in executing its strategy.  
Whilst we acknowledge that we are not directly responsible 
for the operation of many of the underlying assets in our 
portfolio, we are committed to making the pursuit of best 
practice in environmental, social and community, human 
rights, health and safety and diversity matters a high priority.
BOARD
We were disappointed to announce in February 2018 that 
Rachel Rhodes had decided not to put herself forward for 
re-election at the forthcoming AGM due to the ever-increasing 
time commitments of her other roles. Rachel has played an 
enormous part in the success of the Company over the past 
few years, and we will miss her valuable sector insights and 
views. We have commenced the process to find a suitable 
replacement. Mike Blyth has assumed the role of chair of  
the audit committee.
Since taking over from Mike Blyth as Chairman at the 2017 
AGM, I have been actively seeking to help drive the growth of 
the business on which the whole team is focused. The other 
Directors bring different skills to the table and, I believe, enable 
the Board to operate effectively with appropriate diversity of 
approach whilst operating the various Board Committees with 
the independence expected of us as a listed company on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
I am indebted to Mike Blyth for his efforts during his tenure  
as Chairman to ensure we have robust corporate governance 
structures and culture in place. I am delighted that he has 
agreed to continue as a Director such that we may still benefit 
from his wise counsel.  
OUR STRATEGIC REPORT
Our 2017 Strategic Report, from pages 08 to 43, was reviewed 
and approved by the Board on March 27, 2018.
OUTLOOK
2018 should be a year of continued growth for Anglo Pacific  
as production at our key assets continues to demonstrate 
strength and as new assets make their contribution.  
Much, however, will depend on how prices move during the 
year.  In addition, as confidence returns to the mining sector, 
fresh opportunities will arise. We have shown our ability to be 
innovative and imaginative in our approach to the Denison 
and Piaui opportunities and believe that such an approach  
will continue to bear fruit in the year ahead.
In conclusion, I should like to thank all Directors and the entire 
executive team led by Julian Treger for their continued 
diligence and hard work during the year.
On behalf of the Board
