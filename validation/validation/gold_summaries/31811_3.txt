  Interim Chairman’s statement
Sam Williams, Interim Chairman
The Board is fully 
committed to the 
delivery of our strategy. 
Last year we set out our vision as 
the “architects” of drug discovery, 
constantly innovating and finding 
novel ways to solve challenges in 
biology and chemistry that confound 
others and, through this, building 
the world’s most productive Drug 
Discovery Engine.
This has been an important year in 
delivering that vision. We have continued 
to strengthen the data package around our 
lead Orexin-1 antagonist and believe its 
broad applicability in addiction and related 
disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic 
stress disorder and impulse control make 
it a compelling candidate for partnership. 
Our agreement with Evotec will involve us 
working together on novel small molecule 
drug targets across a range of targets and 
stages of development.
We are also seeing the power of our Drug 
Discovery Engine with exciting new targets 
identified in inflammation/autoimmune 
diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. 
These, alongside our existing programmes, 
open new opportunities for future 
revenue-generating deals with the 
pharmaceutical industry.
During the year we have strengthened 
our financial position through the raising 
of a total of £12 million and added a wealth 
of knowledge and experience to our Board 
with Brad Hoy and Dr Craig Fox joining 
as Directors.
We continue to build towards becoming 
a significant self-sustaining business and 
look forward to further progress in the 
coming period in delivering on the 
potential of our model.
