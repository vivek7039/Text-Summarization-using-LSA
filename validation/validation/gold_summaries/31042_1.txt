EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Chief Executive’s report
With production growing,  
a strong focus on cost control  
and a substantially reduced cash 
capital expenditure programme,  
EnQuest should see strong  
cash flow growth.
Amjad Bseisu Chief Executive
EnQuest’s priorities and performance 
in 2017
2017 was a transformational year for 
EnQuest, positioning the Group for 
profitable growth and transitioning from 
a period of heavy capital investment to 
one in which the Group can begin to 
reduce its debt. The Group focused on 
the Kraken development, completion of 
the asset acquisitions from BP, delivery 
against our financial and operational 
targets and the effective management 
of the Group’s financial position.
Operational performance
EnQuest was proud to deliver first 
oil from Kraken on schedule while 
significantly reducing full cycle gross 
capital expenditure. Kraken is one of the 
largest developments in the North Sea in 
the last ten years, comprising a phased 
drilling campaign of 25 wells tied back 
to a complex new Floating Production, 
Storage and Offloading (‘FPSO’) vessel. 
The drilling performance has been 
excellent, with the first three programmes 
completed early and at a lower cost than 
originally planned. The FPSO has taken 
longer than expected to commission, 
leading to lower operational efficiency 
than planned. A systematic process to 
resolve these issues has improved uptime 
and, with the reservoir performing in line 
with expectations, production increased 
throughout 2017 and into 2018.
On 1 December 2017, EnQuest completed 
the acquisition of initial interests in 
Magnus, SVT and associated infrastructure 
from BP and assumed operatorship. 
This large and complex transition 
was achieved safely and efficiently, 
delivered on time and on budget, with 
the integration of these assets into the 
EnQuest business progressing well.
EnQuest’s average production of 
37,405 Boepd reflected Electrical 
Submersible Pump (‘ESP’) performance 
issues at Alma/Galia and lower than 
planned production from both Kraken and  
Scolty/Crathes. Overall the Group’s 
production performance was disappointing 
and led to EnQuest reducing its 2017 
production guidance in August last year. 
However, the combination of improving 
performance at Kraken, planned drilling 
and workover campaigns at a number of 
assets and a full year’s contribution from 
Magnus underpins EnQuest’s expectation 
of material production growth in 2018.
Net 2P reserves of 210 MMboe at the end 
of 2017 represented a 2.4% decrease on 
the 215 MMboe at the end of 2016. This 
small decline reflects some changes in 
long-term assumptions, combined with 
lower production performance in the 
North Sea, partially offset by the Magnus 
acquisition related increase and better 
performance in Malaysia. When EnQuest 
was formed in 2010, it had 81 MMboe of 
reserves. Our ability to exploit, develop, 
convert and selectively acquire or dispose 
of reserves has meant that by the end 
of 2017, EnQuest had produced almost 
the entirety of this initial reserve base, 
and still has 2P reserves with a current 
production life of around 17 years.
Financial performance
The Group’s focus on financial discipline 
resulted in total operating expenditures 
of $349.3 million, unit opex of $25.6/Boe 
and cash capital expenditure of 
$367.6 million. While it is becoming more 
challenging to deliver the large decreases 
in operating costs of recent years, the 
Group will continue to pursue further 
operating cost reduction initiatives.
EBITDA of $303.6 million was materially 
lower than 2016. This reduction was 
driven by lower realised prices, which 
reflected the forward prices available at 
the time at which the commodity hedge 
programme was implemented, combined 
with lower production. The commodity 
hedge programme resulted in realised 
losses of $20.6 million in 2017 compared 
to realised gains of $255.8 million in 2016.
EnQuest’s ongoing programme of prudent 
measures to improve liquidity included 
the completion of an $80 million oil 
prepayment transaction and execution 
of a $37.25 million refinancing agreement 
in relation to its Tanjong Baram project, 
which completed in February 2018. 
Combined, this provides over $100 million 
of additional financial resources. EnQuest 
continued its close dialogue with its 
lending banks, agreeing a relaxation of 
the Company’s covenants and amending 
the amortisation schedule of its Term 
Loan and Revolving Credit Facility; these 
changes provided additional flexibility 
while Kraken continued to increase 
production rates. EnQuest finished the 
year with net debt of $1,900.9 million, 
excluding Payment in Kind interest.
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Assurance (‘HSE&A’)
EnQuest delivered on its commitment 
to continual improvement in HSE&A 
performance, achieving good year-on-year 
improvement in 2017 with excellent 
results in many areas and meeting the 
majority of our performance targets.
In occupational safety, our Lost Time 
Incident (‘LTI’) performance remained 
strong in both Malaysia and the UK, with 
many assets recording an LTI-free year. 
We had no reportable hydrocarbon 
releases during 2017 on our UK operated 
assets, having increased our focus on asset 
integrity and implemented hydrocarbon 
prevention plans across our sites. Our drive 
for operational excellence saw continued 
focus in the UK on coaching our workforce 
to identify and understand control of Major 
Accident Hazards (‘MAH’), embedding 
our life saving rules and transitioning 
to a new control of work tool which 
enhances both system and behavioural 
compliance. In March, members of the 
Board visited a contractor’s emergency 
response centre to help benchmark 
and refine EnQuest’s own emergency 
response and crisis management plans.
EnQuest’s focus on HSE&A is always 
a priority. Under our continual 
improvement programme, activities in 
2018 focus further on control of MAH 
and developing and empowering 
employees to deliver safe results.
North Sea operations
In December, Faysal Hamza and Bob 
Davenport took over management of 
EnQuest’s North Sea operations as 
Interim Head of North Sea and Managing 
Director – North Sea, respectively.
Production in 2017 from the North Sea 
averaged 28,467 Boepd, down 7.0% 
compared to 2016. This reduction was 
driven by lower volumes from Alma/Galia 
reflecting ESP-related well shut-ins, 
storm-related production outages 
and natural declines. Production at 
other assets was also reduced by lower 
water injection, natural declines and an 
unscheduled shutdown in December of 
the third-party operated Forties Pipeline.
Partially offsetting this decline was 
production from Kraken, a full year of 
production from Scolty/Crathes, limited 
by wax in the flowline, and the initial  11

2018 performance and outlook
The Group expects material production 
growth in 2018 to between 50,000 
and 58,000 Boepd, largely driven by 
performance at Kraken and a full year’s 
contribution from Magnus, partially 
offset by natural declines elsewhere in 
the portfolio. Production performance in 
the first two months of 2018 was strong 
across the portfolio, with Kraken gross 
production averaging around 38,000 Bopd 
in this period. Extreme cold weather in 
early March resulted in brief shutdowns at 
a number of the Group’s North Sea fields. 
While Kraken was shut down, the Group 
has undertaken much of the workscope 
previously scheduled for the planned 
shutdown in April and, as a result, this 
planned shutdown is no longer required. 
The Group continues to have planned 
maintenance shutdowns at a number of 
the Group’s fields, including Kraken, in 
the third quarter. During 2018, EnQuest 
expects to drill three wells at Magnus and 
two wells at PM8/Seligi which, along with 
the workover programme at Alma/Galia, 
should result in an improved production 
performance later in the year, with the DC4 
programme expected to come onstream 
in 2019, sustaining Kraken production.
Unit opex is expected to be approximately 
$24/Boe. Cash capital expenditure is 
expected to be lower than 2017 at 
approximately $250 million and primarily 
relates to drilling campaigns at Kraken, 
Heather and PM8/Seligi.
With production growing, a strong 
focus on cost control and a substantially 
reduced cash capital expenditure 
programme, the Group should generate 
positive net cash flow which will enable it 
to start reducing debt.
In January 2018, EnQuest received  
$30 million in cash in exchange for 
agreeing to undertake the management 
of the physical decommissioning at 
Thistle and Deveron and being liable to 
make payments to BP by reference to 
3.7% of the gross decommissioning costs 
of these assets.
Future growth opportunities
With Kraken delivering and the Group 
transitioning from a period of heavy 
investment, our focus is now turning 
towards the next stage of EnQuest’s 
development. The Group has significant 
potential within the existing portfolio, 
in particular at Magnus, PM8/Seligi 
and, in the longer term, Kraken. 
Each of these fields has substantial 
reserves and resources in place and 
with EnQuest’s proven capabilities in 
enhancing hydrocarbon recovery from 
mature and underdeveloped assets, 
the Group is well placed to deliver 
long-term sustainable growth.
contribution from Magnus. Various 
production enhancement activities 
were successfully undertaken during 
the year, improving performance at 
a number of fields by year end.
The Kraken development
Following first oil on 23 June 2017, 
production increased throughout the 
second half of the year as both production 
and injection wells performed in line with 
expectations and the commissioning and 
operational efficiency issues encountered 
during the initial production build up 
were addressed. The second processing 
train, which was brought online during 
November, assisted in bringing gross 
production rates to over 40,000 Bopd. 
All production and water injection wells 
from the first three drill centres have 
been brought online and operational 
efficiency has significantly improved. 
Whilst production has been constrained, 
FPSO charter rates have been reduced 
in accordance with production levels. 
We continue to work with the operator 
to maximise production from Kraken.
The combination of excellent delivery of 
the DC3 drilling programme, lower market 
rates for the remaining subsea campaign 
and the renegotiation of the drilling rig 
contract with Transocean has resulted in 
significant reductions to the full cycle gross 
project capital expenditure, which is now 
expected to be c.$2.3 billion. This is more 
than 25% lower than originally sanctioned.
Magnus and the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal
The acquisition is a good strategic and 
operational fit for EnQuest, providing 
opportunities for synergies and growth. 
We invest safely to realise value from 
opportunities presented in maturing 
assets, applying our differential 
capabilities to deliver high levels of 
production efficiency, asset life extension 
and cost control. The transaction 
is aligned with the UK’s strategy of 
Maximising Economic Recovery by 
getting the right assets into the right 
hands. Magnus is a good quality reservoir 
with large volumes in place, providing 
opportunities for infill drilling and the 
revitalisation of wells. BP’s confidence 
in EnQuest taking over operatorship 
underlines EnQuest’s capabilities 
as an asset life extension expert.
Malaysia operations
Production in 2017 was broadly in line 
with 2016 at 8,938 Boepd, reflecting good 
operational uptime across PM8/Seligi 
and Tanjong Baram and the execution of 
key work scopes, such as the compression 
reliability improvement and well 
interventions at PM8/Seligi. Given the 
natural decline rates of these mature 
fields, this performance is testament to 
the team’s capabilities in maximising 
hydrocarbon recovery in advance of 
the Group’s first drilling campaign 
in PM8/Seligi, planned for 2018.
DELIVERING EFFICIENCY
1 EBITDA is calculated on a 
business performance 
basis, and is calculated 
by taking profit/(loss) 
from operations before 
tax and finance  
income/(costs) and 
adding back depletion, 
depreciation, foreign 
exchange movements 
and the realised gain/
(loss) on foreign currency 
derivatives related to 
capital expenditure.
