Renold has performed robustly this year against a backdrop of challenging 
markets. We have continued to make progress on a number of the key 
objectives underpinning our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
Our health and safety KPIs continue to improve. We have successfully delivered key consolidation projects, which are expected to improve 
our efficiency. We have sold two properties in the period, generating net cash proceeds of £10.2m. Significantly, this year we have also 
commenced a multi-year project which relocates our Chain manufacturing facilities in China to a new purpose built facility. Despite the 
challenging market conditions we have continued to invest in commercial and marketing activities as well as further invest in ‘state of the art’ 
machinery. These actions under the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan will generate incremental value particularly when market conditions improve.

Underlying results are retranslated to current year exchange rates.
The Group uses alternative performance measures to provide useful historical financial 
information to help investors evaluate the underlying performance of the business by 
adjusting for volatility created by one-off items and non-trading performance related 
costs such as amortisation and legacy pension costs. A reconciliation to reported results is 
included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.

Operational highlights
 Æ Improvement in health and safety accident rate 
KPIs. All major manufacturing sites certified to 
OHSAS 18001. 
 Æ Completion of the consolidation of the European 
Distribution Centre with the facility in Germany 
and successful transfer of all UK Couplings 
manufacturing into Cardiff.
 Æ Significant increase in the Group’s capital 
investment programme in the year to £10.9m. 
Key projects delivered in the latter part of 
the year will support further cost reductions, 
improved operational efficiency and enhanced 
product quality and service improvements.
 Æ Investment in sales and marketing activities 
in support of organic growth is demonstrating 
results, particularly in Chain Europe. 
 Æ Successful disposal of the former European 
Distribution Centre in Seclin, France. Completion 
of the sale and short-term leaseback of the 
Australian property at Mulgrave, Melbourne, 
ahead of relocating the facility. Together, these 
disposals generated net cash proceeds of £10.2m.
 Æ Successful integration of Renold Tooth Chain 
following last year’s acquisition. Renold Tooth 
Chain continues to trade ahead of expectations.
Chart shows an estimate of the average underlying monthly sales required for the 
Group to deliver a breakeven adjusted operating profit. The estimate is based on 
actual variable margin in the years in question so that when the actual fixed costs are 
deducted the resulting adjusted operating profit is £nil. The resulting sales figure is 
then divided by 12 calendar months to arrive at the level of monthly sales required 
to breakeven. The breakeven point at March 2017 reflects the increased fixed cost 
acquired with Renold Tooth Chain, along with increased commercial and marketing 
activities. These factors increase the breakeven point, but are partially offset by 
ongoing operational improvements.
