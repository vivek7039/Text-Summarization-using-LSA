Highlights
Summary: margin improvement despite deflation
Dairy Crest has implemented significant changes during the last 
two years. We are a much leaner, more focused organisation that 
makes predominantly branded and high value-added products. 
This allows management and the business to focus on those 
areas that will drive long-term value creation: innovation, brand 
building, efficiency improvements and cost reduction. 
I am particularly pleased that overall margins in the business 
have improved. This is despite the difficult input cost environment 
and the longer than expected commissioning period of the new 
functional ingredients facility at Davidstow. The strength of our 
brands, our well-invested supply chain and the quality of our 
people all ensure that the Company is well positioned for the 
future. This will help us to maintain our strong track record of 
rewarding shareholders with higher dividends.
market background: the return of inflation
We are a major UK buyer of milk and last year we purchased 
around 500 million litres. The past year has seen a turning 
point in dairy prices. After a prolonged period of deflation, dairy 
commodity prices have experienced strong gains. Low milk prices 
had an effect on milk volumes. They were down in most large milk 
producing countries across the world. Consequently milk prices 
rose. During the course of the year we have increased the price 
we pay farmers for milk by 38% to 30 pence per litre. Since then 
we have announced a 1 pence per litre reduction from June and a 
further 1 pence per litre reduction from July. We pay our farmers 
a fair, competitive price for their milk and our price remains one of 
the highest in the country.
However these inflationary forces do take time to work their 
way through to the prices that consumers see in the shops. In 
the first nine months of the financial year cheese retail prices fell 
or remained stable. Since Christmas, however, we have seen 
evidence of prices increasing on shelf. 
Butter has been even more affected than cheese. Cream 
prices, which determine the input costs for butter, more than 
doubled during the year. Inevitably this has impacted margins in 
our butters, spreads and oils business.
Managing volatility is a challenge for both us and food retailers, 
our principal customers. For this reason we continue to work with 
our customers to help to grow our categories through innovation, 
marketing and category merchandising.
Key brands perform robustly
Overall revenues from our four key brands were down 6%. This 
is in line with our expectations. Most of this decline was due to 
the deflationary market place that we experienced for over three 
quarters of the year. Key brand volumes were flat across the year. 
Volume growth in Frylight, Clover and Country Life spreadable was 
offset by declines in Country Life block butter, which we promoted 
less, and Cathedral City. However, as predicted, the latter made 
good progress in the second half of the year, with a return to 
volume growth.
Cheese
IRI data for the 52 weeks ended 25 March 2017 shows that the 
total cheese market grew by 3% in volume but was unchanged 
in value terms. Within this the everyday cheese market grew 
by 2% in volume but fell by 3% in value, a deflation of 5%. For 
much of the year there were high levels of cheese stocks in the 
market. In order to maintain the brand’s premium positioning 
within the category we decided against discounting aggressively. 
Consequently, Cathedral City slightly underperformed this market 
growth, with volumes down 3% for the year. However volumes 
improved in the second half and this positive momentum has 
continued into 2017/18.

During the year we redesigned the pack to emphasise its ‘no 
artificial ingredients’ credentials and this was highlighted in well 
received TV advertising in the fourth quarter. This advertising has 
driven increased growth during the final quarter with market share 
climbing to 15% and the brand will be advertised again in the first 
quarter of this year. We were delighted that during the year Frylight 
received the Institute of Grocery and Distribution (IGD) ‘Health and 
Wellness’ product award.
infant formula quality improvement
The quality targets for infant formula grade demineralised whey  
are rightly demanding. During the year we have continually 
improved our product so that by the year end we had met our 
target of 80% of our demineralised whey being of infant formula 
grade. The feedback we have received from customers so far on 
the quality of our product has been very positive. In partnership 
with Fonterra we are building our sales relationships with infant 
formula producers for both GOS and demineralised whey and 
expect strong growth in sales of these products during the coming 
year, with the majority of this growth coming in the second half of 
the year.
Long-term demand for proteins looks robust. Whey protein 
concentrate prices have risen strongly in the second half and 
demineralised whey prices are now starting to firm. We are well 
positioned to deliver improved returns in 2017/18.
An important part of the long-term future for GOS is its 
potential beyond the infant formula market, to extend its use into 
other areas such as animal and adult nutrition. The research and 
development programme for GOS in animals has broadened 
and during the year we signed an agreement with Danisco 
Animal Nutrition, part of DuPont. Trials are now underway in this 
partnership that will provide an extensive level of research into the 
benefits of GOS in the animal husbandry industry.
innovation 
The retained business is much more focused following the sale 
of the Dairies business. The pace of innovation is, and needs 
to be, an important point of difference. Future growth will be 
underpinned by innovation. 
Our Innovation Centre on the Harper Adams University 
campus, which opened in late 2015, is already helping to drive our 
ambitious target of 10% of sales each year coming from innovation 
in the previous three years. This year, helped by the re-launch of 
Clover with ‘no artificial ingredients’, we achieved 13% of sales 
from innovation during the last three years. This is an industry-
leading level of innovation.
CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Cathedral City remains the nation’s favourite cheese brand. It 
accounts for 54% of total branded everyday cheese sales in the 
UK and almost three fifths of households bought Cathedral City 
during the past year.
Earlier in the year we successfully rolled out a refreshed 
master brand identity for Cathedral City. The new design simplifies 
the brand, improves visibility on shelf and strengthens our range. 
This allows our brand investment to work better across the whole 
of the growing cheese category. It was supported by significant 
investment including a successful new TV advertisement, ‘The 
Rules of Cheese’. We have seen a positive consumer reaction 
both to the new packaging and the marketing campaign. 
Spreads and butters 
IRI total market data for the 52 weeks ended 25 March 2017 
shows that butter volumes grew by 2% but that spreads volumes 
declined by 7%. Selling prices for spreads were down very slightly 
for the year and for butters were up slightly. However, for butter 
this full year number masks the change from heavy deflation in the 
first part of the year to price increases of 16% in the last quarter.
Our main spreads brand, Clover, had a very successful year, 
growing volumes at 1% versus a significant market decline, partly 
driven by increased promotional volumes. Our other smaller 
spreads brands, Utterly Butterly, Vitalite and Willow also performed 
well and our total volume growth in spreads, including Clover, was 
4%, 11 percentage points better than the market. This means that 
our overall spreads market share has climbed by 2 percentage 
points to 27.2%.
With Clover we continued to reinforce the ‘no artificial ingredients’ 
positioning through a marketing campaign in the first half of the year 
and launched new packaging in the second half of the year. We were 
pleased that the ‘no artificial ingredients’ recipe received external 
recognition as ‘Product of the Year 2017’ in the spreads category in 
the world’s largest consumer survey award for product innovation.
Whilst Country Life overall volumes were flat for the year, sales 
were up 2%. Country Life spreadable, which accounts for 65% of 
brand sales, grew volumes by 6% and was the best performing 
major branded spreadable product over the year. However the 
block product experienced a volume decline as we promoted less 
following the sharp rises in input costs.
Frylight: another exceptional year
Frylight, our one calorie cooking spray, has had another outstanding 
year. Volumes grew by 23% and sales by 19%, well ahead of market 
growth of 1% and 2% respectively (Kantar data for the 52 weeks 
ended 26 March 2017). Frylight has strengthened its lead as the 
UK’s number one oil brand and increased its share of the market for 
the whole year to 11%, with a household penetration rate of 23%.  Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 11
Strategic report
GROWING
 
Innovation continues to drive our business forward. As well as 
building on the success of the new Clover product, in the year 
ended 31 March 2017, we:
•	 brought a new Frylight product to market – avocado spray oil;
•	 developed a new Frylight cap design to be launched in early 
2017/18;
•	 launched a new Cathedral City snack bar range;
•	 re-launched the Cathedral City spreadable range; 
•	 strengthened our ‘dairy free’ Vitalite range with the launch of a 
new coconut variant; and 
•	 agreed a partnership with Fowler Welch Coolchain Ltd, a logistics 
specialist, to maximise the throughput at our Nuneaton distribution 
and warehousing site.
A simpler business
Dairy Crest is a simple, lean and responsive business. We have 
five well-invested manufacturing sites and fewer than 1,200 
employees. There are opportunities to further simplify procedures 
and support structures within the business. During the year 
we embarked on a change to our core IT systems which will 
bring benefits over the next two years. This will deliver a more 
appropriate and cost effective IT infrastructure for a business of 
our scale and is also acting as a catalyst for us to simplify the 
processes that sit alongside these IT systems.
We continue to drive operational efficiency improvements. A 
particular focus is improving performance efficiency at Kirkby, 
where we successfully consolidated all our butters and spreads 
production onto one site in 2015. We are confident that all our 
sites will contribute towards further improved productivity over the 
year to 31 March 2018.
Future prospects
In the first full year since the transformational sale of our Dairies 
business, we have delivered a robust performance in a tough 
market. 
Our industry leading margins are the result of us driving long-
term value through innovation, brand building, investment in a 
world class supply chain and strong cost control. 
Our key brands continue to perform well. Cathedral City 
remains the nation’s favourite cheese and following its brand 
refresh at the start of the year, the good progress and momentum 
we have seen in the last six months has continued in the new 
financial year. Our overall spreads market share has climbed, and 
Frylight had another outstanding year with sales growing 19%, 
well ahead of the market. The ongoing investment we are putting 
behind our brands gives me confidence that we can grow market 
share. 
We have continued to make good progress in our demineralised 
whey operations at Davidstow. We are now hitting our targeted level 
of demineralised whey being of infant formula grade. Developing our 
sales of demineralised whey and GOS into the high-margin global 
infant formula market will be a key priority this year. At the same 
time we are continuing our research into other potential animal and 
human applications for GOS.
Looking forward, I am excited about the future for Dairy Crest. 
The business is well positioned to deliver profitable, sustainable 
growth and stronger cash generation, underpinning our 
commitment to growing our dividends and reducing debt.
