 Chief Executive Officer’s review
The leading global  
biotech company  
focused on rare diseases
2017 is the year Shire solidified its position 
as the global leader in rare diseases. 
With approximately 70 percent of revenues 
coming from rare disease products, and the 
most robust pipeline in Shire’s history — 
60 percent of which are biologic therapies 
— we continue to make significant progress 
in the Company’s evolution.
As we evolved, we also put the Company 
on solid financial footing. Key to Shire’s 
performance has been the ability to achieve 
strong financial results while managing 
our largest integration. We grew by 
approximately 17,000 employees and 
consolidated 28 country sites globally — 
and remain on track to deliver on our 
Baxalta cost synergy goal of $700 million 
by the third year post-close. We achieved 
sales growth of 33 percent and delivered 
a strong operating cash flow of $4.3 billion 
— enabling us to realize our 2017 leverage 
ratio target. 
We are proud that we now have five of our 
seven franchises contributing more than 
$1 billion in revenue annually. Immunology 
delivered outstanding performance in 2017, 
driven by the success of our sub-cutaneous 
immunoglobulin products and growth in 
International markets. Ophthalmics, our 
newest franchise, generated sales of $259 
million in 2017 as XIIDRA, the only therapy 
approved in the U.S. to treat the signs and 
The main reason I believe our 
Company has performed so 
well is because the Shire team 
is driven by a clear mission, 
a shared purpose, and strong 
values — all of which put the 
patient at the center of all that  
we do.
6 Shire Annual Report 2017 symptoms of dry eye disease (DED), 
reached more than one million prescriptions 
written since launch in late 2016. I am 
greatly appreciative of what our talented 
and focused team has delivered, in many 
cases, exceeding our performance 
expectations in 2017. 
Two distinct market-leading businesses
Since I arrived at Shire five years ago, 
we have grown from an ADHD-focused 
company to a global biotech with two 
distinct market-leading businesses — rare 
disease and neuroscience. To enable these 
two businesses to reach their full potential, 
in early 2018 we announced that the 
neuroscience business warranted 
additional sharpened focus and increased 
investment and that there was a strong 
strategic rationale for creating separate 
Rare Disease and Neuroscience divisions. 
For more information about the two 
divisions, please see page 12. 
Innovation at the heart of our 
vision and culture 
Our long-term vision is to be an innovation-
driven biotech company focused on rare 
diseases and specialized conditions across 
our core scientific platforms and 
therapeutic areas. Shire has an excellent 
record of accessing external innovation and 
delivering late-stage products to market. 
Going forward, we plan to build on these 
capabilities by taking our internal research 
to a new level. To accelerate this goal, 
we have appointed a new Head of 
Research and Development and Chief 
Scientific Officer, Andreas Busch, PhD, an 
accomplished scientist with an extensive 
background and impressive track record 
in research.
At the same time, we continue to 
complement our R&D innovation with new 
advances in health information technologies 
and precision medicine. Shire is utilizing 
artificial intelligence (AI) as well as pursuing 
wearables and sensor technology, 
particularly in clinical trials. We are 
partnering with new, cutting-edge 
companies to improve the time it takes 
for rare disease patients to find a diagnosis, 
tailor our treatment options for smaller 
patient groups, and help us identify hard 
to find patients for clinical trials. More 
information about these efforts can be 
found on page 30.
We are also working to enhance our 
manufacturing network with an eye 
towards optimizing our reliability and 
growth. We’re making important changes 
to our internal and external networks to 
reduce redundancy while also ensuring 
supply continuity. Among the benefits of 
these changes, we anticipate savings of 
$100 million annually beginning in 2019 and 
$300 million annually by 2023. Additionally, 
we are modernizing the manufacturing 
network with new facilities in Georgia 
(U.S.) and Dublin (Ireland). Our Georgia 
plant will expand manufacturing capacity 
for our plasma-derived products by 
approximately 30 percent, while our 
Dublin facility will focus on production 
of antibody-based therapies. 
An industry-leading pipeline
Our R&D organization continues to fuel our 
robust pipeline with innovative therapies. 
In 2017 , our R&D team completed 54 major 
market regulatory filings around the world. 
In addition, Shire received two U.S. FDA 
Fast Track Designations, two Orphan 
Drug Designations, and one Breakthrough 
Therapy Designation. We completed 
nine Phase 3 clinical trials, and received 
126 product approvals globally. These 
accomplishments are major strides forward 
on behalf of our patients. Additional details 
about our pipeline can be found on page 24. 
New product launches fueled growth
As we advanced programs through the 
pipeline, we also developed a team that 
excels at product launches and ensures 
patients have access to these important 
therapies. We executed 50 product 
launches globally in 2017, including the 
initial launch of MYDAYIS in the U.S. and 
expanded into multiple new geographies 
for products such as CUVITRU, NATPARA/

Patient and customer focus
The main reason I believe our Company 
has performed so well is because the Shire 
team is driven by a clear mission, a shared 
purpose, and strong values—all of which 
put the patient at the center of all that we 
do. We know we are most successful when 
we have patients front of mind, inspiring 
our thinking, and guiding our work every 
single day. 
Central to our mission at Shire is being 
close to our patients and our partners, 
which allows us to not only serve them 
better, but also to innovate based on their 
insights. We are often with patients for the 
long-term, given that half of rare diseases 
are diagnosed in childhood. From diagnosis 
to finding appropriate treatment options, 
securing access, and supporting patients 
on treatment, we are committed to the 
wellbeing of our patients for life. The 
inspiration they provide to our team is 
second-to-none. I’d like to take this 
opportunity to thank our patients, their 
families, and their healthcare providers 
for allowing us to be part of their journey. 
Navigating challenges
While I am extremely proud of Shire’s 
accomplishments in 2017, the year was 
not without its challenges. We faced 
generic competition for LIALDA (for the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis) for the first 
time. We also faced a supply interruption 
during the summer for CINRYZE (for the 
treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE)) 
related to issues with a third-party 
manufacturer. We thank HAE patients and 
the HAE community for their patience while 
we worked diligently to address this issue 
and have taken steps to mitigate this risk 
in the future, including bringing additional 
manufacturing of drug product in-house 
beginning in 2018. 
We also experienced increased competition 
in the Hematology franchise, but continue 
to be confident in our leadership position. 
Shire is committed to innovating and 
building for the future — as it can be seen 
with ADYNOVI receiving a positive opinion 
and, early this year, the marketing 
authorization from the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) and with the recent approval 
of myPKFiT, a registered software-based 
medical device for personalized hemophilia 
A dosing in the U.S. And, we continue to 
invest in and expand our pipeline of 
innovative Hematology programs.
While we are proud of our accomplishments 
in 2017, we also acknowledge that we need 
to work even harder on improving 
shareholder value throughout 2018.
Despite these challenges, Shire performed 
very well financially in 2017 — delivering 8% 
pro forma product sales growth to $14.4 
billion, an increase of over $1 billion. We 
also improved our operating margin and 
operating cash flow of $4.3 billion which 
enabled us to reach our debt target. 
Employees and culture
I would like to thank Shire employees and 
the Board of Directors who has provided 
invaluable guidance for the organization. 
We’ve grown from fewer than 6,000 
employees to more than 23,000, and 
everyone continues to focus on our mission 
to serve the needs of patients. The 
accomplishments achieved in 2017 are 
incredible and I look forward to an equally 
impressive 2018.

Outlook and summary
We left 2017 stronger than we’ve ever been 
before with leadership positions in many of 
the therapeutic areas in which we compete. 
In particular, we now have a leading 
high-growth Immunology franchise, which 
will be the foundation of our rare disease 
business as we move into 2018. Our 
neuroscience business will soon benefit from 
increased investment and focus as we look 
to broaden our expertise beyond ADHD.
2018 will be a year of continued focus 
on commercial execution and targeted 
investment in our manufacturing 
infrastructure, new product launches, 
and pipeline to drive future growth. We 
expect to deliver mid-single digit product 
sales growth in 2018 after absorbing the 
anticipated impact of generics. Based on 
current assumptions, we also expect 
margins to be impacted by the start-up 
of our new U.S. plasma manufacturing 
site, intensifying genericization, and lower 
royalties. But, I remain confident that Shire 
will continue to build on our leadership 
position in both rare disease and 
neuroscience and we are committed to 
achieving our 2020 goal of $17-$18 billion 
in revenues and mid-forties Non GAAP 
EBITDA margin.
I am energized and excited about Shire’s 
future as we look forward to growing our 
franchises, especially Immunology; 
executing on our many launches; leveraging 
our robust international footprint in key 
markets such as China to expand access 
to our 40+ marketed products; and, 
building an innovative, results-oriented, 
patient-centric culture. I am confident that 
our team and our partners will continue to 
execute on our priorities and serve as 
champions for our patients.
