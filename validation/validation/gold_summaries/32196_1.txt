STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
The Group continues to 
perform robustly and 
deliver strong service 
levels for customers The year ended 31 March 201 7 has been 
another year of good progress and strong 
trading performance, securing important 
renewals and winning new contracts with 
new services and new customers. 
Revenue in the year ended 31 March 201 7 was 
£1,1 18.1m (2016: £1,1 32.5m excluding WRM), 
which represents a year on year decrease of 
1.3%. This has been driven primarily by the full 
year impact of contracts exited in the prior 
year, including all closed book home shopping 
contracts in Pullman, partly offset by revenue 
from contract wins.
Underlying operating profit grew by 7 .0% 
to £52.1m (2016: £48.7m excluding WRM), 
reflecting a continued strong operating and 
financially disciplined performance across 
the business, including an improvement in 
the performance of the Pullman business 
following the exit of loss-making contracts in 
the prior year. As a result we have achieved 
an underlying operating margin of 4.7%, up 
from 4.3% (excluding WRM) in the prior year.
Underlying EPS grew a healthy 1 5.9% and 
supports the growth in final dividend per share 
to 6.1p, resulting in a total 9.1p for the year.

Group underlying EPS
Following the disposal of Wincanton Records 
Management (WRM) in December 201 5, 
the Group has, with effect from 1 April 2016, 
refocused its internal management structure 
under the following two reportable segments; 
Retail & Consumer and Industrial & Transport. 
Segmental information for the year ended 
31 March 2016 has been realigned to aid 
comparability, and in line with management 
reporting, the results of WRM have been 
excluded from the results of the reportable 
segments in the prior year.
RETAIL & CONSUMER
2017 2016 Change
Revenue (£m) 649.3 624.4 4.0%
Underlying 
operating profit (£m) 25.8 25.2 2.4%
Margin (%) 4.0% 4.0% nil bps
Retail & Consumer reported revenues of 
£649.3m in the year, a 4.0% year on year 
increase compared with the £624.4m reported 
in the year to 31 March 2016. The contractual 
split of this segment between open and closed 
book remains relatively constant at 87% open 
book (2016: 90%).
Underlying operating profit for the year was 
£25.8m, up 2.4% on the £25.2m reported 
last year.
The split of Retail & Consumer revenue by the 
industry sectors it serves is as follows:
2017  
£m
2016
£m Change
Retail general 
merchandise 315.5 278.2 13.4%
Retail grocery 228.7 234.7 (2.6)%
Consumer products 105.1 111.5 (5.7)%
649.3 624.4 4.0%
The overall revenue increase was driven 
primarily by the impact of contract wins and 
strong volume growth with Home & DIY 
business customers, reported within Retail 
general merchandise. This growth was partly 
offset by the impact of lost volumes due 
to contract cessations in Retail grocery and 
Consumer products.
The business successfully renewed a number 
of important contracts and extended the 
services with key customers, such as Co-op 
providing food distribution services and 
Sainsbury’s providing warehousing and 
distribution services. Both of these important 
renewals demonstrate the strong partnership-
based ethos with our customers and our 
commitment to driving greater efficiency into 
these logistics operations. In a challenging 
grocery marketplace we will deliver substantial 
savings into the future for our customers. 
New business wins included a five year contract 
with wilko, one of the UK’s fastest growing 
retailers, to manage all UK transport operations, 
a three year warehouse management contract 
with Coca-Cola, a four year contract with IKEA 
and a five year contract with Majestic Wine to 
establish and operate an eCommerce National 
Fulfilment Centre. For IKEA, we will provide 
operational development and support for 
two new distribution centres, supporting their 
multichannel distribution growth strategy.
In any contracting business inevitably the new 
business growth has been partially offset by 
revenue reduction on contract losses and exits 
due to changes in customer requirements 
or transfers to alternative providers. 
During the year, this included the cessation of 
the Morrisons convenience store business, and 
a lost contract with Nestlé both announced last 
year as well as the cessation of a Tesco contract 
from July 201 7 .

Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts STRATEGIC PROGRESS
We have made good progress against our 
strategic goals in both sectors as follows:
Delivering improvements for our 
customers in our existing operations 
and retaining existing contracts
Significant contracts were renewed during 
the year including Sainsbury’s and Co-op. 
Both are long standing customers of over 
20 years. The renewals are based on the 
strength of our relationships and a partnership 
approach to their supply chain needs as well 
as on our service excellence, adaptability and 
dependability. As customers adapt to changing 
consumer behaviour the evolution of the 
supply chain is an increasingly important part 
of the renewal process. 
During the year, the Construction business 
expanded its service offering into the  
ready-mixed concrete market and has 
commenced the acquisition of more than 100 
ready-mix vehicles. This investment is backed 
by an eight year contract with Hanson UK and 
supports the Group’s view that the prospects 
for the UK construction industry are positive as 
evidenced by the Government’s desire to build 
a million new homes by 2020 and to invest in 
major infrastructure projects.
Improving ‘share of wallet’ with our 
existing customers and focusing on 
cross selling our services
Excellent relationships are at the heart of our 
success and we ensure that we understand 
our customers’ needs and challenges so that 
we can add value to their business. During the 
period, we have extended the services we 
provide to a number of customers including 
Britvic and Screwfix. With Britvic we have 
extended our 1 9 year partnership and in 
addition to the distribution centre operation 
we have won a five year contract to operate 
their national transport operations. We have 
also extended our relationship with Screwfix 
with an agreement to design and manage a 
newly built warehouse.
These extended contracts demonstrate our 
track record of service excellence combined 
with a compelling commercial approach and 
added value.
Acquiring new customers through 
improved prospecting process and 
innovative service propositions
We were pleased to win new contracts with 
IKEA, wilko and Majestic Wine during the year.
To support IKEA’s multichannel distribution 
growth strategy, we have sourced and fitted 
out two warehouses in South East England 
which are now in operation. The new facilities 
will create an efficient and reliable operation 
which will support IKEA’s future growth plans.
INDUSTRIAL & TRANSPORT
2017 2016 Change
Revenue (£m) 468.8 508.1 (7.7)%
Underlying 
operating profit 
(£m) 26.3 23.5 11.9%
Margin (%) 5.6% 4.6% 100bps
Industrial & Transport reported revenues of 
£468.8m in the year, down 7 .7% on the £508.1m 
reported in the prior year.
The underlying operating profit of £26.3m 
compared to £23.5m last year, driven by the 
improvement in performance of the Pullman 
business together with non-recurring items 
from contract cessations such as property-
related credits.
The split of Industrial & Transport revenue 
by the industry sectors it serves is as follows:
2017  
£m
2016 
£m Change 
Transport 
services 207.0 234.8 (11.8)%
Construction 134.4 138.5 (3.0)%
Other 127.4 134.8 (5.5)%
468.8 508.1 (7.7)%
The decrease in revenue compared to last year 
is primarily due to the cessation of the closed 
book Pullman home shopping contracts in 
the second half of last year, volume pressures 
in container transport operations (both within 
Transport services above), the insourcing 
of a construction logistics contract and 
the cessation of a contract within defence 
operations (included within ‘Other’) at the 
half year, partially offset by growth in our 
EnergyLink business and the start-up of our 
ready-mix concrete offering.
With over 60 years’ experience supporting 
the defence sector we received another gold 
standard accreditation known as the ‘SC21’ 
during the year. We are the first third party 
logistics company to be accredited with the 
gold SC21 award. Our defence operation 
was recognised for our change programme 
designed to accelerate the competitiveness of 
the aerospace and defence industry. This award 
demonstrates our commitment to continuous 
improvement and efficiency that we deliver 
through our tailored innovative supply 
chain solutions. 
Excellent relationships 
are at the heart of our 
success and we ensure 
that we understand our 
customers’ needs and 
challenges so that we 
can add value to their 
business

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED Our employees were also proud to be jointly 
awarded the Bis Henderson Third Party 
Logistics Provider of the Year at the Hermes 
Retail Week Supply Chain awards. The award 
in late September 2016 was awarded on the 
evidence of innovation, execution of those 
initiatives, a level of true collaboration with retail 
clients and evidence of those solutions to our 
customers, over the past 1 2 months. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
The health and safety of our people is our 
number one priority and we were pleased 
that our continued reduction in reported 
incidents was maintained this year as a result 
of our health and safety driver and warehouse 
initiatives and training programmes. 
During the year, we have also continued 
to support and encourage our people 
to be as happy and healthy as possible, 
through our award winning health and 
wellbeing campaigns to improve knowledge 
and understanding of issues particular 
to our industry.
We are acutely aware of our responsibilities 
to minimise our environmental impact and 
have ensured during the year that all sites, 
depots and offices have sustainability plans in 
place to minimise the environmental impact 
of their activities on the local environment. 
The continued reduced environmental 
impact statistics detailed later in the Corporate 
responsibility report on pages 28 to 31 show 
how much our commitment and efforts are 
paying off and we were proud to retain the 
Carbon Trust Standard to March 2018 which 
we have held since 2010.
Wincanton is a large scale employer in the UK 
and Ireland and we celebrate the diversity of 
background and ethnicity. Our employee base 
comprises 1 7 ,500 people with British, Irish, other 
EU and non EU heritage and we recognise and 
are grateful for the contribution they all make 
to the Group and wider economy now and in 
the future.
INNOVATION
We are serious about bringing innovative 
solutions to our business and our customers 
and we bring this together in Wincanton 
through our W
2
 programme. Our W
2
 Ideas 
Accelerator initiative is focused on finding and 
implementing innovative ideas from within 
Wincanton, harnessing and managing them 
via an interactive platform and engaging 
approach. Our W
2
 Labs initiative has been 
established in partnership with L Marks, 
innovation specialists and early-stage investors. 
We are taking the Wincanton brand and certain 
key logistics themes to the worldwide start-up 
community to identify great ideas to trial in our 
business incubator. 
PEOPLE
Wincanton employs 1 7 ,500 people, who are 
clearly our greatest asset. I thank them for their 
continued dedication, support and focus on 
our business and service to our customers.
Helping our people to develop and progress 
their careers with Wincanton is a really 
important element of our people strategy. 
We launched the ‘Your Future’ programme 
during the year as a new training programme 
to help attract people into logistics. We were 
delighted that a Wincanton General Manager 
was recognised in the Grocer’s Top New 
T alent list in 2016 for his work creating the 
programme. Additionally, our HR team won 
multiple awards at the HR Excellence Awards 
recognising our T alent Management Strategy 
and Health and Wellbeing programmes for 
colleagues and the overall “HR Excellence 
Gold Award”. 
We were delighted to be awarded the contract 
to manage all UK transport operations for 
wilko, the family owned retailer. We will be 
responsible for the replenishment of their 
900-strong store portfolio making over 100,000 
deliveries per annum.
The set up and successful Christmas operation 
of a new National Fulfilment Centre (NFC) 
for Majestic Wine has again proven our 
eCommerce expertise. We now generate over 
£250m of revenue from customers where 
we help them deliver their multichannel 
operations, which demonstrates great 
capability in a changing retail landscape.
Driving ongoing cost reductions and 
cash generation
Our track record in continuous improvement 
helps our customers in terms of lowering their 
cost of operations in open book contracts and 
supports our margins in closed book contracts. 
This continued drive to improve efficiency 
of operations strongly supports our ability to 
retain existing contracts with customers and 
build long term partnerships.
We continued the year on year trend of strong 
positive net cash flow of £1 5.2m (2016: £18.1m), 
see cash flow table on page 22. This excellent 
cash performance enables us to have the 
confidence to lift our final dividend from 
5.5p to 6.1p per share this year resulting in a 
total dividend for the year of 9.1p per share 
(2016: 5.5p per share). We also continue to 
support our legacy pension scheme with 
deficit recovery plan payments, net of certain 
Scheme administration costs, of £14.1m in the 
year (2016: £20.9m). The remainder of cash 
generated reduced the level of closing net 
debt to £24.3m (2016: £39.5m).
BREXIT
Following the result of the EU Referendum 
in June 2016 we have closely followed 
developments in our markets and assessed 
the potential impact on our business. As a UK 
and Ireland focused business the direct impact 
to date has been negligible for Wincanton. 
However, we do recognise the potential to 
experience an affect as our customers’ markets 
are impacted. This could be both positive 
or negative dependent on factors such as 
consumer confidence, construction investment 
sentiment, the effect of the devaluation of 
sterling currency and the availability of labour 
in the UK market place.
