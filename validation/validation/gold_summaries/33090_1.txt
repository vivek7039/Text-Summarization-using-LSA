now on the delivery of the multi-
year Mall asset management 
programme announced in 
conjunction with the Capital 
Raise in June 2014 which we 
now expect to total £65 million

Positive operational performance
It	is	particularly	pleasing	that	in	a	year	
which	has	been	dominated	by	corporate	
activity	and	against	a	backdrop	of	often	
challenging	conditions	for	our	retailers,	
the	Group	has	been	able	to	report	an	
improvement	in	its	key	operational	metrics	
during	2014.
After	a	number	of	years	in	which	shopper	
numbers	have	fallen,	footfall	was	up	
across	the	seven	shopping	centres	in	
absolute	terms	(by	0.9%)	and	continued	
to	outperform	the	benchmark	(by	1.8%).	
This	is	supported	by	information	from	our	
indicative	C&R	trade	index	which	showed	
retailers’	sales	across	our	portfolio	were	
up	2.2%	in	2014	compared	to	a	0.5%	
decrease	in	2013.	
Administrations	were	sharply	lower	in	
2014	compared	to	2013.	This	has	helped	
occupancy	grow	from	95.0%	as	at		
30	December	2013	to	96.1%	at	the	
end	of	2014	on	a	like-for-like	basis.	
This	increased	occupancy	has	led	to	an	
increase	in	passing	rent,	particularly	in	the	
second	half	of	the	year	from	£62.8	million	
as	at	30	June	2014	to	£64.5	million,	an	
increase	of	2.7%	as	at	30	December	
2014.
Increased asset management activity
Completion	of	the	Mall	acquisition	
has	enabled	the	Group	to	accelerate	
delivery	of	a	number	of	value	enhancing	
initiatives	across	the	portfolio	which	were	
previously	compromised	by	uncertainty	
surrounding	the	future	of	the	Mall	Fund.	
The	much	needed	certainty	provided	by	
the	transaction	has	resulted	in	heightened	
levels	of	engagement	between	our	asset	
managers,	local	councils,	retailers	and	
leisure	operators.	The	Group	is,	as	a	
consequence,	in	a	much	stronger	position	
to	commit	increased	investment	to	its	
shopping	centre	portfolio.	Three	clear	
trends	as	we	accelerate	delivery	of	our	
plans	are	visible:
•	 Fashion	retailers	are	still	taking	new	
space	in	shopping	centres	where	
refurbishment	and	reconfiguration	have	
made	it	attractive	and	affordable.	The	
very	successful	opening	of	the	Next	
and	H&M	stores	at	Waterside,	Lincoln,	
highlight	the	potential	that	can	be	
unlocked	as	these	lettings	enabled	the	
Group	to	dispose	of	the	asset	at	a	yield	
of	5.88%.
•	 There	is	still	strong	demand	from	
leisure	operators	to	take	space.	
Unused	office	space	in	Wood	Green	
is	now	being	reconfigured	to	support	
the	opening	of	both	a	hotel	and	the	
extension	of	a	gym	by	the	end	of	2015.	
The	creation	of	The	Hub	at	Redditch,	
which	has	attracted	a	gym	operator	as	
well	as	three	restaurants	alongside	the	
Vue	Cinema,	has	led	to	a	significant	
increase	in	footfall	across	the	scheme.	
At	the	same	time,	the	refurbishment	of	
Worcester	Square	led	to	Costa	taking	a	
second	unit	and	attracted	new	retailers	
such	as	Swarovski,	which	has	opened	
with	an	exceptionally	strong	trading	
performance.
•	 Changing	demographics	are	having	
a	significant	impact	on	demand	for	
space	in	and	around	London.	Fashion	
retailers	are	excited	by	the	plans	to	
extend	the	Walthamstow	scheme	
whilst	residential	opportunities	in	
Walthamstow	and	Wood	Green	seem	
to	have	much	greater	potential	than	
originally	anticipated.
Innovative technology
The	Group	has,	for	many	years,	been	
at	the	forefront	of	developing	digital	
technology	to	support	footfall	and	spend	
across	its	shopping	centres.	During	the	
course	of	the	year,	the	Group	entered	
into	a	“Click	&	Collect”	agreement	
with	CollectPlus,	the	leading	UK	store-
based	parcel	service.	This	is	the	first	
such	agreement	to	include	dominant	
community	shopping	centres.	Initial	
trials	in	Camberley	and	Redditch	have	
proved	to	be	successful,	particularly	as	
the	service	attracts	customers	of	retailers	
which	are	not	represented	in	our	malls	into	
the	centres.
Aggressive recycling of capital
The	sale	of	the	Group’s	German	portfolio	
(which	completed	shortly	after	the	
year-end),	together	with	the	earlier	sale	
of	its	interests	in	Hemel	Hempstead	
and	Lincoln,	reflect	a	year	of	aggressive	
recycling	of	capital.	In	contrast	to	previous	
years,	the	proceeds	were	re-invested	
in	growth	through	the	acquisition	of	a	
controlling	stake	in	the	Mall	Fund	from	
Aviva	Investors.	Importantly,	recycling	
has	been	well	timed	to	take	advantage	 23714.04    15 April 2015 10:01 AM      Proof 8

of	an	investment	cycle	which	began	to	
accelerate	as	the	year	has	progressed.	
The	key	highlights	were:
•	 The	sale	of	Lincoln	for	£46	million.	The	
net	proceeds	to	the	Group	of		
£15.7	million	represented	an	uplift	of	
£4.8	million	or	44%	on	the	30	June	
2014	carrying	value.	
•	 The	German	portfolio	was	sold	at	
a	small	premium	to	year	end	NAV	
resulting	in	net	cash	proceeds	of	£42.1	
million.	
•	 The	acquisition	of	a	62.56%	stake	in	
The	Mall	in	July	2014	at	a	5%	discount	
to	the	June	2014	valuation.
Strengthening of balance sheet
Following	completion	of	the	acquisition	
of	The	Mall	and	the	sale	of	Lincoln	and	
Germany,	the	proforma	see-through	net	
loan	to	value	of	the	Group	has	fallen	from	
54%	to	45%	as	at	30	December	2014.	
With	the	exception	of	£15.5	million	in	
respect	of	the	Redditch	investment,	all	
of	the	Group’s	proforma	see-through	net	
debt	of	£352.1	million,	adjusted	for	the	
sale	of	Germany	and	payment	of	The	
Mall	performance	fee	and	income	due	to	
former	unit	holders,	is	now	on	balance	
sheet.
In	May	2014	the	Mall	CMBS	was	
refinanced	by	entering	into	a	new		
£350	million	five	year	secured	bank	loan	
and	an	additional	£25	million	capex	
facility	at	a	day	one	cost	of	3.37%.	The	
structure	of	the	facility	was	subsequently	
amended,	following	completion	of	our	
62.56%	acquisition	to	enable	the	tender	
for	the	minorities	to	be	funded	from	within	
the	Mall.
The	Group’s	Revolving	Credit	Facility,	
which	was	increased	to	£50	million	to	
accommodate	the	offer	for	The	Mall,	has	
now	been	reduced	to	£20	million	following	
completion	of	the	sale	of	Germany	in	
February	2015.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Continued
The	Group	raised	£165	million	of	new	
equity	during	the	year	to	fund	the	
acquisition	of	The	Mall.
Outlook
Income	growth	will	be	the	key	driver	of	
property	valuations.	There	is	still	scope	
for	further	yield	compression	given	
the	continuing	strength	in	investment	
markets,	but	we	expect	growth	in	valued	
income	to	be	a	more	significant	factor	
in	the	future.	This	will	be	driven	by	the	
fact	that	increased	consumer	spending	
provides	retailers	and	leisure	operators	
with	confidence	to	take	units	in	schemes	
where	we	have	shown,	and	continue	to	
demonstrate,	a	commitment	to	invest	in	
the	creation	of	attractive	and	affordable	
space	right	across	the	portfolio.	
The	Group’s	operational	focus	is	now	on	
the	delivery	of	the	Mall	asset	management	
programme	announced	in	conjunction	
with	the	Capital	Raise	in	June	2014	which	
we	now	expect	to	total	£65	million.	A	
significant	part	of	the	investment	takes	
place	in	the	next	two	years.	We	are	
expecting	total	income	returns	of	at		
least	10%.
Key	decisions	on	the	two	developments	
at	Camberley	and	Maidstone	can	be	
expected	this	year.	We	are	now	entering	
a	period	of	intense	discussion	and	
negotiation	with	both	local	councils	and	
anchor	retailers	on	the	scope	of	the	
developments	and	expect	to	be	able	to	
clearly	define	both	projects	together	with	
the	Group’s	commitment	by	the	end	of	
the	year.
Acquisitions	will	focus	on	opportunities	
which	enable	the	Group	to	boost	
income	and	support	a	progressive	
approach	to	dividend	growth.	At	this	
stage	in	the	property	cycle	we	see	
attractive	opportunities	to	acquire	
assets	comparable	in	size	to	Lincoln	
(as	evidenced	by	the	announcement	
of	the	acquisition	of	the	Buttermarket	
Shopping	Centre	in	Ipswich)	which	offer	
the	opportunity	for	repositioning	through	
asset	management	which	will	facilitate	the	
introduction	of	new	retailers	and/or	leisure	
operators.

£1.2m
raised  
since 2010
Over	the	last	four	years	we	have	raised	
over	£1.2	million	through	our	Mall	Cares	
programme.	
Two	of	the	events	undertaken	in	2014	by	
staff	at	The	Mall	Luton	commemorated	
the	100th	anniversary	of	the	Great	War.
•	 The	Mall	Luton	purchased	a	100th	
anniversary	sculpture	for	display	in	the	
centre.	Working	in	conjunction	with	the	
Royal	British	Legion	and	the	Sea	Cadets	
a	military	service	was	held	on	1	August	
2014,	and	at	11.00	am	the	Service	
Standards	were	lowered	to	the	sound	of	
the	last	post	as	an	ex-serviceman	read	
the	poem	for	the	fallen.	
•	 After	the	two	minute	silence,	the	first	
poppies	to	be	placed	on	the	sculpture	
were	by	the	service	personnel	present	
and	the	Mayor	of	Luton,	followed	
by	mall	staff.	Over	the	following	four	
weeks	customers	placing	poppies	on	
the	sculpture	donated	over	£2,700.	
•	 The	sculpture	was	used	again	later	
in	the	year	to	support	the	official	
Poppy	Appeal	helping	to	raise	more	
than	£20,000,	a	record	for	the	annual	
collection	within	the	Mall	Luton.	
•	 In	August	2014	Mark	Broadhead,	the	
General	Manager	of	The	Mall	Luton,	
was	part	of	a	team	who	cycled	225	
miles	from	Luton	to	the	battlefields	of	
Flanders	in	Belgium	raising	more	than	
£22,000.
