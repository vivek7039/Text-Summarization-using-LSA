Chief Executive’s Statement
Julian Wassell
Revenue for the year was up 3% at 
£5.11 million compared with £4.96 million 
the year before. We saw slightly higher 
sales activity throughout the year in relation 
to both of our key products, Quantum VS 
and Vecta, and also increased levels of 
professional services activity, for which 
credit should go to our professional 
services team.
Because of the high margin nature of 
the business (our gross margin is typically 
over 90%), this increase in turnover had a 
significant impact on our underlying operating 
profitability, which increased 26% to £540,000 
from £430,000 a year earlier. Continued 
careful management of the cost base meant 
that overheads (as used in the calculation of 
adjusted operating profit) were maintained 
at near identical levels to the previous year. 
Whilst an increase in sales of 3% can result 
in a 26% increase in operating profit, we 
are always mindful that the converse is also 
true and remain vigilant in controlling the 
cost base.
In common with many businesses, we 
are conscious that the UK economy faces 
considerable uncertainty over the coming 
years. Most of our customers are directly 
impacted by Brexit one way or another. The 
majority of them import and are affected by 
the significant exchange rate movements 
that we have experienced over the last 
18 months or so. Different sectors have 
varying views of the future, with some of 
those in the Builders Merchants sector, 
for example, currently feeling more positive 
than some of those who are not directly 
involved in construction. The fact that we 
offer our products into a variety of industry 
verticals within the distribution sector, 
provides our business with a good degree 
of resilience as we are not overly reliant on 
any one sector. However, economic uncertainty 
typically can mean that significant capital 
expenditure decisions can be delayed or 
even cancelled as businesses take a 
“wait and see” approach.
Our consistent strategy for many years has 
been to strengthen the relationship we have 
with our customers by growing the proportion 
of our revenues delivered through our hosting 
centre in Milton Keynes. Last year hit yet 
another record as 61% of our revenues 
were delivered using the hosting model. 
This was up from 59% last year, and, in 
fact, we have seen this figure grow for 
17 out of the last 18 years.
We continue to manage the migration process 
from our legacy applications to Quantum VS 
carefully. At 30 September 2017, we had 
signed 48 customers for Quantum VS 
compared to 40 a year earlier. The decision 
to change ERP solution is a major decision 
for any business, and, whilst we believe that 
Quantum VS provides an excellent solution 
for the majority of the users of our older, 
legacy products, the migration process 
itself inevitably leads to higher levels of 
customer churn than we have historically 
seen. This will continue to be the case. 
Some of the users of our legacy products 
are keen to remain on their current system 
for the foreseeable future and we are geared 
to offer a flexible approach to work with 
them. This often leads to a new long term 
(5 year) contract, which provides them with 
comfort and us with excellent visibility of 
revenues and the ability to plan our resources 
going forwards. Of course, we will seek 
to promote Quantum VS to them at an 
appropriate time in the future.
Our combined CRM and Business 
Intelligence (BI) product Vecta generated 
28% of total revenues during the period 
under review, up from 25% a year earlier. 
We have stated previously that in the medium 
term, we would expect to see the proportion 
of our total revenues represented by Vecta 
to increase due to the fact that its sales 
cycle is much shorter than that for an ERP 
solution, such as Quantum VS, and this 
remains the case.
Strategy
Our principal software products, Quantum 
VS and Vecta, offer clear business benefits 
to our customers helping them to generate 
sales growth or to create efficiencies and 
reduce costs. Quantum VS and Vecta are 
complementary, with many of our 
customers using both.
Quantum VS is a comprehensive ERP 
application, which addresses a focussed 
number of verticals within the distribution 
sector, including builders and timber merchants, 
suppliers of fixings and fastenings, industrial 
and security products and electrical 
wholesalers. As noted above, our long-term 
strategy is to manage the migration of 
customers from our four legacy applications 
(Merchant, Charisma, Esprit and The Business 
Programme) to Quantum VS, whilst identifying 
and exploiting new business opportunities 
in our target vertical markets.
Summary
•  Revenue for the year was up 3% at 
£5.11 million compared with £4.96 million 
the year before. We saw slightly higher 
sales activity throughout the year in 
relation to both of our key products, 
Quantum VS and Vecta. 
•  This increase in turnover had a significant 
impact on our underlying operating 
profitability, which increased 26% to 
£540,000 from £430,000 a year earlier.
•  Contracted recurring revenues represented 
80% of total revenues during the year, 
compared with 82% last year.
•  Cash balances amounted to £6.4 million 
at 30 September 2017, up from £5.4 million 
the previous year.
Last year hit yet another 
record as 61% of our 
revenues were delivered 
using the hosting model. 
This was up from 59% last 
year, and, in fact, we have 
seen this figure grow for 
17 out of the last 18 years. Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4
“ Quantum VS is a comprehensive ERP application, 
which addresses a focussed number of verticals 
within the distribution sector.”
Strategy continued
Vecta is an extremely powerful combined 
CRM and BI product which drives sales 
growth for businesses in a range of verticals 
much wider than those addressed by 
Quantum VS. 
Our strategy remains to exploit the space 
between the major CRM products, which 
typically do not deliver sales analysis as 
standard, and pure BI tools. 
We continue to invest in the long-term future 
of our key products through significant levels 
of R&D. During the year to 30 September 2017 
our R&D expenditure was £901,000 
(2016: £982,000). This represented 18% 
of total revenues (2016: 20%).
Business model
All of our software products are supplied 
under long-term contracts. In the case of 
Quantum VS and our legacy products these 
are typically of five years initial duration; in 
the case of Vecta it is typically three years. 
Contracts for ERP applications can be either 
in the form of traditional on-site licencing 
arrangements or hosted service level 
agreements. In the case of Vecta, which is 
only offered as a cloud-based service, new 
contracts are exclusively hosted service level 
agreements. These contracted recurring 
revenues represented 80% of total revenues 
during the year, compared with 82% last 
year. Typically, our customer relationships 
extend well beyond the initial contract period. 
The recurring revenue model gives us good 
visibility of revenues and strong cash flows 
as charges are mainly invoiced annually 
in advance. 
The remainder of our revenues arise 
from initial software licence fees, initial 
hosting service charges and the provision 
of professional services. We also supply 
a small amount of low-margin 
computer hardware.
Financial review
Revenue for the year was £5.11 million 
compared with £4.96 million last year, an 
increase of 3%. Second half revenues were 
£2.57 million (2016: £2.45 million) compared 
with £2.54 million in the first half of the 
year (2016: £2.51 million). 
As noted above adjusted operating profit 
increased 26% to £540,000 (2016: £430,000) 
representing an operating margin of 10.6% 
(2016: 8.7%). Statutory pre-tax profit was 
£417,000 (2016: £244,000).
Adjusted operating profit is used by 
the Board and management to monitor 
the performance of the business on a 
day-to-day basis and it is the headline 
profit figure in the management accounts. 
It excludes interest receivable, any gains 
and losses on property transactions, 
one-off exceptional items and a number 
of non-cash items which arise under 
IFRS (including defined benefit pension 
scheme charges and the capitalisation 
and amortisation of development costs). 
A full reconciliation of adjusted operating 
profit to statutory operating profit is 
provided in note 4 to the consolidated 
financial statements. Furthermore, 
as noted in the Remuneration Report, 
adjusted operating profit is the measure 
on which the Directors’ bonus is based.
Cash balances amounted to £6.4 million 
at 30 September 2017, up from £5.4 million 
the previous year. This includes operating 
cash flows of £580,000 and £1.2 million 
cash received from the sale of property. 
Other significant cash items were dividends 
paid of £635,000 and capital expenditure 
of £118,000.
R&D expenditure was £901,000 
(2016: £982,000). Of this £89,000 
(2016: £127,000) was capitalised as 
required by IAS 38. Amortisation of 
previously capitalised R&D expenditure 
amounted to £110,000 (2016: £96,000). 
Accordingly, the R&D charge in the income 
statement is £922,000 (2016: £951,000).
The tax charge for the year was £23,000 
(2016: £86,000) which represents an effective 
tax rate of 5.5%. The main reason for the low 
effective tax rate this year is a prior year 
corporation tax adjustment of £71,000. Of 
this, £61,000 relates to tax refunds received 
in respect of R&D tax relief claimed for the 
2015 and 2016 accounting periods.
Earnings per share was 3.11p compared to 
1.25p last year, an increase of 149%. On a 
fully diluted basis this amounted to 3.09p 
(2016: 1.24p).
Pension
As a result of the significant increase in 
the discontinuance surrender value of the 
defined benefit scheme’s Grouped Funding 
policy, the value of the pension scheme’s 
assets under IAS 19 has increased by 
approximately £3 million this year. This 
factor, coupled with actuarial gains of 
approximately £900,000 resulting from 
updated financial and mortality assumptions, 
has eliminated the deficit of £3.88 million 
(£3.22 million net of deferred tax) that was 
shown in the 2016 balance sheet. In 2017, 
the balance sheet shows a small pension 
surplus under IAS 19 of £240,000 
(£156,000 net of deferred tax), a movement 
of £4.12 million (£3.38 million after deferred 
tax). Of this movement, net of deferred tax, 
£70,000 has been charged in the income 
statement and £3.45 million has been 
credited directly to reserves.

As previously announced, the triennial 
valuation of the scheme as at 31 July 2016 
was completed and signed off by the actuary, 
trustees and employer in October 2017. 
On a scheme funding basis, the deficit 
at 31 July 2016 was finalised at £70,000, 
representing a funding level of 99%.
The deficit is expected to have been 
cleared by the 2018/19 scheme year as a 
result of the payment of terminal bonuses 
by the scheme insurer in respect of member 
retirements that will take place over the 
next two years. The formal deficit recovery 
plan does not therefore require the immediate 
payment of cash contributions by the Company. 
However, the Company has agreed with the 
trustees to make a one-off contribution of 
up to a maximum of £118,000, payable on 
or before 31 July 2020, in the event that the 
terminal bonus payments do not cover the 
deficit in full.
Net assets
Net assets per share increased to 50.7p 
(2016: 25.3p). The increase is primarily due 
to the improvement in the position on the 
defined benefit pension scheme.
Property
As previously reported we sold our last 
remaining surplus freehold property in 
December 2016 for £1.2 million. We had 
previously written the property down in the 
balance sheet to reflect the expected net sale 
proceeds which amounted to £1.17 million 
after costs. Following the sale we have 
achieved expected cash cost savings of 
around £20,000 a year.
Outlook
Balancing the migration of customers from 
our legacy ERP products to Quantum VS, 
whilst identifying and converting new business 
opportunities for Quantum VS and Vecta 
remains our principal focus. Wider economic 
factors and uncertainty over Brexit, in particular, 
continue to affect business confidence 
generally and may impact discretionary 
capital expenditure decisions including 
replacement of IT systems. However, the 
strength of our business model built around 
an 80% recurring revenue base, together 
with continued investment in our sales 
team and product development, should 
mean we are well placed to deal with the 
challenges we face over the coming year.
Finally, I would like to thank all of my 
colleagues throughout the business for 
their hard work and commitment during 
the year.

Key Performance 
Indicators
The following 
financial KPIs 
are used by the 
Board to review 
the performance 
of the business:
Level of software 
related revenues
Revenue from software and 
services increased by 2.7% in FY17.
Sales of software and services 
account for 97% of total Group 
revenues in FY17, with the remainder 
comprising low-margin hardware 
sales and hardware maintenance.
Adjusted operating 
profit margin
Our adjusted operating margin was 
10.6% in FY17 compared with 8.7% 
in FY16.
Adjusted operating margin is calculated 
using operating profit excluding 
one-off property costs, certain non-cash 
IFRS adjustments relating to defined 
benefit pension scheme charges, 
holiday pay accruals and capitalisation/
amortisation of development costs 
and other exceptional non-trading 
items. A reconciliation of statutory 
operating profit to adjusted operating 
profit is shown in note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Level of contracted 
recurring revenues
Recurring revenues represent 80% 
of total revenues in FY17 compared 
with 82% in FY16.
Recurring revenues underpin our 
business model and principally 
comprise contracted ongoing 
software licences and hosting fees. 
Level and growth 
of hosted revenues
61% of our revenues were delivered 
through our hosting centre in FY17 
compared with 59% in FY16.
