I am delighted to report that our proposed full year dividend is
15.1 pence per share, 27% higher than last year, moving to a
two-thirds pay out ratio a year earlier than we had previously
announced. We expect to increase the dividend, taking into
account our earnings growth, cash generation and our ongoing
investment needs. In addition, because of the ﬁnancial strength
of the company we are introducing a new £2.5 billion share buy
back programme which we expect to be completed by
31 March 2009.
BUSINESS PROGRESS
We continued to implement our strategy for proﬁtable growth.
New wave revenue now accounts for 36% of our total business.
We are a major player in the global networked IT services
market, meeting the needs of our customers around the world.
In the UK, we have around 11 million broadband lines over
which we are able to offer all our customers – consumer, SME,
corporate and wholesale – a more accessible, faster and richer
broadband experience.

OUR WIDER RESPONSIBILITIES
I am extremely proud of the fact that, for the sixth consecutive
year, BT was the highest placed telecommunications company in
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are committed to
operating in an ethical, sustainable and socially responsible way,
and to having a positive impact on all those communities whose
lives we touch.
As the corporate social responsibility agenda evolves, so does
our strategy. We are, for example, increasingly emphasising
three new priorities:
s tackling climate change. We are committed to cutting our
CO
2
emissions by 80% from 1996 levels by 2016 and to
helping customers and suppliers cut theirs through the more
effective use of communications technology. The fact that our
Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, is chairing the CBI’s climate
change task force indicates how seriously we take this issue.
s enabling sustainable economic growth. We are increasingly
integrating sustainability in all our business processes.
s helping to build a more inclusive society. We are looking at
the ways in which communications technology can help to
build a fairer, more inclusive society.
PENSIONS
Investment performance on assets in the BT Pension Scheme
(BTPS) was very good, with year end value at a record
£38 billion. During the year, BT and the trustees of BTPS agreed
the triennial funding of the scheme. Under a new and more
conservative actuarial methodology, the deﬁcit at 31 December
2005 was calculated as £3.4 billion.
BT has agreed to make deﬁcit payments equivalent to
£280 million a year for ten years, with the ﬁrst three years’
instalments paid up front – £840 million was paid into the
scheme by 30 April 2007. I believe this is a fair and prudent
deal for pensioners and shareholders, and demonstrates that
your company stands fully behind its pension obligations.
YOUR BOARD
I will be stepping down as Chairman in the autumn after more
than six challenging and fascinating years with BT. Sir Mike Rake
will take over as your next Chairman in September. Mike is
currently chairman of KPMG International; he has demonstrated
outstanding leadership of this major global organisation during a
time of turbulence and change. He will bring extensive
international experience to BT as it continues to position itself as
a truly global company.

Chairman’s message
4 BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F
The 2007 ﬁnancial year was a very good one for your company
– our results once again were excellent. Revenue grew by 4%
and earnings per share before speciﬁc items grew by 16% to
22.7 pence. We continued to invest in technologies, networks
and systems that will, we believe, transform our customers’ lives
and businesses, along with their experience of dealing with BT.

A number of changes to the Board have occurred since I last
wrote to you. Sir Anthony Greener stepped down as Deputy
Chairman and from the Board on 30 September 2006 after six
years and I would like to thank him for his very signiﬁcant
contribution to the development of our strategy. His successor is
Maarten van den Bergh, who has been a non-executive director
since September 2000. Maarten, who prior to his retirement was
president of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, also chairs
the Remuneration Committee and is our senior independent
director. And I’d like to welcome two new directors, Deborah
Lathen and Franc ¸ois Barrault. Deborah, who is president of
Washington-based Lathen Consulting, joined the Board as a
non-executive director in February 2007. She brings strong US
business and policy experience to BT, including as a previous
chief of the Cable Services Bureau at the US Federal
Communications Commission. Franc ¸ois joined the Board on
24 April 2007 as Chief Executive BT Global Services (in which
role he succeeds Andy Green who became CEO of Group
Strategy and Operations). As President of BT International,
Franc ¸ois established a record of exceptional growth in BT’s
operations outside the UK.

DELIVERING OUR PLAN
I would like to thank shareholders and customers for their
conﬁdence in our strategy and the loyalty they have shown in
the past six years.
I’d also like to thank our Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, the
other members of the Board – both executive and non-
executive – and all BT people for their efforts and unwavering
support. If I cannot entirely resist the temptation to look back
over the past six years, it is because that is the best way of
acknowledging what they have achieved.
Back in 2001 your company’s net debt had risen to nearly
£30 billion. In response, in May 2001, your Board put in place
an action plan to reduce debt, manage costs and enhance our
abilities to serve our customers even more effectively. That plan
has been delivered.
Debt was brought under control by a combination of the
largest ever rights issue in UK corporate history and the disposal
of a number of businesses including Yell (our international
directories and e-commerce business) and our interests in Japan
and Spain. O2 (previously Cellnet) was demerged and Concert
(our international joint venture with AT&T) was unwound. These
structural changes have provided commercial and ﬁnancial
ﬂexibility for the group and our debt in recent years has reduced
to sustainable levels.
We have rigorously managed our costs, taking a disciplined
approach to eliminating waste and duplication, wherever
possible using our own technology to become more cost
effective.
During that period, new technologies have given customers
access to a range of services – high-speed broadband, ﬁxed-
mobile convergence and next-generation TV – that have
transformed their idea of what is possible. Our efforts in UK
broadband and in global networked IT service have been very
successful.
LOOKING FORWARD
Looking ahead, your company is positioned for success. With a
new Chairman and an experienced CEO at the helm, and a
workforce experienced in the business of transformation, the
signs are very positive. It has been a privilege to be involved
with BT’s journey to this point; I shall, of course, continue to
follow its future progress with great interest and pleasure.
