 “ We believe that the 
Group’s commitment 
to people and their 
development in turn 
results in exceptional 
customer service.”
We are pleased with the Group’s 
performance during FY17, achieving the 
Board’s expectations delivering total sales 
growth of 8.9%, adjusted EBITDA growth 
of 14% and adjusted earnings per share of 
16.2p. Reported profit after tax grew by 43%.
Putting families and friends at the heart 
of our strategy has been instrumental 
in driving our sustainable growth model. 
Our strategy of organic growth, growth 
through acquisition and growth through 
ongoing investment in our estate have 
all combined to support our growth 
during FY17.
Revenue grew by 8.9% to £71.0m when 
compared to the proforma 52-week sales 
for FY16 (proforma sales reflect comparison 
to the 52 weeks between week 2-53 of FY16 
to adjust for the impact of the 53rd week 
in FY16, explained further on page 26). 
This growth was driven by an encouraging 
combination of both like-for-like sales 
growth of 3.6%, driven by a combination 
of spend per head and footfall, and growth 
from the addition of new sites of 5.3%. 
Three site acquisitions were completed 
during the year, in line with our estate growth 
target range of two to four acquisitions per 
year. On a 52-week vs. 53-week reported 
basis revenue grew by 5.5%.
Like-for-like sales growth was driven by 
our continuing focus on good value family 
entertainment, improving our customer 
service standards and Net Promoter Score 
and our ongoing investment into the estate. 
The refurbishments completed at the end 
of FY16 at five of the sites acquired in FY15 
supported strong like-for-like growth in 
these sites, in what was their second year 
under the Tenpin brand. This is supportive 
of our unique Tenpinisation strategy, our 
proven process of converting acquisitions 
to the T enpin model, whereby on acquisition 
sites go through a seven-step integration plan, 
introducing new company controls and IT 
and embedding operational systems to create
multi-channel connectivity, maximise 
yield and review for further capital 
investment, all supported by our skilled 
people. Over and above this, we know 
there is further opportunity and potential 
for us to enhance our sales by better use 
of digital marketing. We have increased 
the size of our contactable database 
by 25% during the year and recruited a 
new digital marketing Director to drive 
engagement with both our existing 
and potential new customers.
Group adjusted EBITDA on the same 
proforma basis grew by 14.4% to £19.0m 
(FY16 PF: £16.6m), with growth driven by 
a combination of the like-for-like sales 
growth and sales growth from increasing 
the number of sites in the estate, together 
with good underlying cost control from 
our self-help programmes. These self-help 
programmes included the implementation 
of a new payroll management system late 
in FY16 and improved rents at four sites as 
a result of negotiated lease re-gears, both 
of which combined to drive underlying 
operating cost reductions of around 1%. 
On a 52-week vs. 53-week reported basis 
EBITDA grew by 8.0%.
As planned, we made good further progress 
with our acquisition programme during FY17, 
completing the acquisitions of three sites 
in Blackburn, Eastbourne and Rochdale. 
Tenpinisation has been completed at all 
three sites. Both Blackburn and Eastbourne 
were also refurbished during the year with 
Rochdale planned for refurbishment during 
FY18. The sites have transitioned well to the 
Tenpin model and, overall, are performing 
in line with our original expectations.
We remain confident in the pipeline of 
acquisition opportunities as we look ahead, 
and during FY18 we expect to grow the 
estate further, in line with previous guidance 
of two to four sites per year. We have made 
good early progress with this objective 
having completed the acquisition of two sites 
in Warrington and Chichester in February.

8 | Strategic report These sites have started their Tenpinisation 
programme and will undergo significant 
refurbishments during FY18.
During the second half of FY17, we 
completed refurbishments of existing 
estate sites in line with our plans at Derby, 
Swansea and Leamington Spa, together 
with a refurbishment at Ipswich (acquired 
in FY16). In total, across both the existing 
estate and acquired sites, six sites benefitted 
from Tenpinisation and refurbishment 
investment during FY17 at a total cost 
of £1.3m. During FY18 we will continue 
to invest in our sites, including a planned 
refurbishment and extension of our 
site in Fountain Park, and selective, 
return-focused, investment in 
refurbishments at a small number 
of further sites in the existing estate. 
Finally, on investment expenditure, 
and in line with our previous guidance, 
we completed the installation of the 
innovative Pins & Strings technology at 
a further five sites (Croydon, Parrs Wood, 
Northampton, Glasgow and Derby) during 
the second half of FY17 at a total cost of 
£1.0m. Pins & Strings is an innovative, new 
generation bowling machine that requires 
less maintenance, is simpler to operate and 
provides improved reliability for customers, 
demonstrated by improvements in the key 
games played per stop metric. We are 
encouraged with the early results at these 
sites and evidence confirms that Pins & 
Strings has the potential to both improve 
the cost efficiency of our sites and also 
improve the overall customer experience. 
As a result of the successful trial, we now 
plan to roll out Pins & Strings across the 
estate over time, and expect to introduce 
the technology to around a further ten 
sites during FY18.
Securing the future of our estate 
continues to be a key priority. During FY17 
we completed lease re-gears, both 
extending the leases and improving the 
terms at Derby, Colchester and Stafford,
reduced the rent at Maidenhead and also 
successfully renewed an expiring lease at 
our site in Swansea. We will continue to 
look for opportunities to both improve 
rental terms and secure the future of our 
estate during FY18.
I stated in our interim results in September 
that I was pleased with how our teams 
throughout the business performed during 
a very busy period which also included the 
completion of a successful IPO process, 
and I am delighted with how they continued 
to perform during a busy second half, 
allowing us to deliver results in line with 
our strategy. This hard work, together with 
the Group’s focus on people, achieved 
deserved recognition from the “Great 
Place to Work” awards, and enabled the 
Group to maintain the prestigious Investors 
in People Gold standard. We believe that the 
Group’s commitment to people and their 
development in turn results in exceptional 
customer service thereby delivering an 
exceptional experience. As a result, we 
achieved significant improvements in 
our Net Promoter Score during the year, 
moving from 49% in FY16 to 66% in FY17. 
I would like to thank all our colleagues for 
their support in providing our customers 
with a great experience.
Outlook 
We have plans in place to continue to 
drive growth in line with our strategy 
during the current financial year and 
expect to perform in line with the Board’s 
expectations. We continue to believe that 
there is further potential for growth in the 
experiential leisure market and the Group 
is well positioned to benefit from this trend.

We have acquired 
three sites this year 
and plan to acquire 
two to four per year 
for the medium term
Growth through acquisition of 
existing bowling sites is a key part of 
our strategy, and we are pleased to have 
acquired three sites this year, which is 
good progress on our strategy to add 
between two and four sites to our 
portfolio per year. 
We look for sites in good locations 
that are typically underinvested and 
that we feel can be improved by our 
Tenpinisation process, which aligns 
the sites with the Tenpin brand and 
processes. There is a good identified 
pipeline of sites that match our criteria 
and we are confident we can continue 
to deliver on our strategy.
