Chairman’s statement
Sanderson Group plc (‘Sanderson’ or 
‘the Group’), is a software and IT services 
business specialising in digital retail 
technology and enterprise software for 
businesses operating in the manufacturing, 
wholesale distribution and logistics sectors.
Financial results
The Group’s trading results for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 show revenue 
of £21.56 million (2016: £21.32 million) 
and operating profit of £3.90 million 
(2016: £3.69 million) after adjusting for 
the amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles, ‘one-off’ non-recurring items and 
share-based payment charges. The ‘one-off’ 
non-recurring items, totalling £0.49 million, 
include costs relating to potential acquisitions 
during the year, the consolidation of office 
premises with internal reorganisation, as 
well as the costs incurred in changing the 
Group Finance Director. Mitigating and 
offsetting these costs, was the receipt in full, 
of a licence fee from a former customer who 
had been disputing payment relating to their 
access of the Group’s software.
Overall, gross margin remains high at 82% 
(2016: 84%) and though slightly lower than 
the prior year, the continuing high gross 
margin reflects the continued emphasis 
and focus upon the supply of Sanderson 
proprietary software and services. Recurring 
revenue, which is revenue derived from pre-
contracted software licence fees and ongoing 
support services, increased to £11.18 million 
(2016: £10.75 million) representing 52% 
of total revenue in the period (2016: 
50%). Sales order intake grew by 12% to 
£13.69 million (2016: £12.26 million). The 
Group order book at 30 September 2017 
was £5.79 million (2016: £3.02 million) 
and includes a significant new order from 
an existing customer which is scheduled to 
be delivered over the course of the next two 
financial years.
Sanderson has a strong, cash-generative 
business model which has resulted in a 
cash balance at 30 September 2017 of 
£6.18 million (2016: £4.34 million), well 
ahead of market expectations. This balance 
is stated after the increased payment of 
£1.38 million (2016: £1.21 million) in 
dividends to shareholders during the year.
Dividend
The Group’s continuing strong cash 
generation enables the Board to maintain a 
progressive dividend policy whilst continuing 
to invest in the further development of the 
Group’s businesses. Subject to the approval 
of shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, scheduled to be held at 11am on 
Thursday 15 February 2018, the Board is 
proposing an increase of 11% in the final 
dividend to 1.55 pence per ordinary share 
(2016: 1.4 pence). This makes the total 
dividend paid in the year of 2.65 pence per 
ordinary share and represents an increase of 
10% over the prior year (2016: 2.4 pence). 
The final dividend, if approved, will be 
paid on 16 March 2018, to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
2 March 2018.
Post period end event – 
Acquisition
On Friday 24 November, the Group 
announced the acquisition of Anisa 
Consolidated Holdings Limited for an 
enterprise value of £12 million.
Anisa specialises in the delivery of world-
class integrated supply chain and enterprise 
resource planning solutions and has around 
250 customers who are provided with 
twenty-four hour support on a worldwide 
basis throughout the year. Anisa employs 
over 90 staff and operates from office 
locations in London, Runcorn, Liverpool 
and Solihull within the UK and from smaller 
support operations in Singapore and 
Australia. Anisa complements the Enterprise 
Division of Sanderson and the enlarged, 
merged business is expected to provide and 
develop incremental and synergistic market 
opportunities. The managed services, hosting 
services and cloud delivery services which 
have been developed by Anisa represent 
an exciting and enhanced service delivery 
option for existing Sanderson customers.
Commenting on the acquisition, Group Chief 
Executive, Ian Newcombe, said:
“We are delighted to welcome the Anisa 
team, led by Ross Telford, David Renshaw 
and Lionel Moore, together with their Anisa 
colleagues to Sanderson and we are excited 
by the prospect of combining our two 
strong, well-positioned businesses and by 
the opportunities that will arise from working 
closely together in the future.”
The Group's continuing 
strong cash generation 
enables the Board to 
maintain a progressive 
dividend policy whilst 
continuing to invest in the 
further development of 
the Group's business.

Chairman’s statement  
continued
The acquisition of supply chain & ERP solutions specialist, Anisa, provides incremental opportunities
Anisa and Sanderson have known each other 
for many years and though this transaction 
is a Sanderson acquisition, it feels more like 
a merger. Whilst Anisa and Sanderson have 
rarely competed in their respective target 
markets, they are very complementary in 
terms of their ethos and business model - 
providing cost-effective solutions, supported 
by providing quality service to customers, 
thereby building and developing long-term 
relationships. The strategy of the combined 
business is to continue to develop the 
existing range of products and services 
delivered to existing customers; to further 
invest and develop the Anisa relationships 
with strategic partners and to provide 
additional investment in order to accelerate 
growth opportunities by attracting even more 
new customers. 
Our enlarged Group provides a great 
opportunity to further build shareholder 
returns and shareholder value and we value 
and appreciate the confidence shown by 
the Anisa team, in agreeing to hold their 
new Sanderson shares for at least a period 
of three years. We believe that our enlarged 
Group provides a great opportunity to further 
increase returns and value for Sanderson 
shareholders. 
Strategy
The strategy of the Board is to achieve 
sustained growth by continuing to build and 
to develop the Sanderson business. Whilst 
investment is planned across all of the 
Group’s businesses, particular emphasis will 
again be placed on enhancing the range of 
mobile and ecommerce solutions in Digital 
Retail, where digital transformation is an 
active market opportunity. Mobile-enabled 
solutions continue to be developed to 
address all of the Group’s target markets. 
The Group will further strengthen its 
proposition to customers in the Enterprise 
Division, especially in providing solutions 
for food and drink processing, as well as 
investing in the further development of 
products covering the logistics, fulfilment 
and supply chain areas. Sanderson has 
enjoyed considerable success, building a 
strong reputation over a number of years 
within the wholesale distribution market and 
further investment is planned, developing a 
new suite of digital based solutions.
In order to augment organic growth, selective 
complementary acquisitions are under 
continuous consideration. We are pleased 
that Anisa is now part of the Group and 
a number of potential opportunities have 
been and are being considered. Sanderson 
management endeavours to adopt a careful 
and measured approach to acquisition 
opportunities and cautiously considers any 
risks which might be involved. The Board 
remains focused upon further increasing 
shareholder value by continuing to deliver 
both organic and acquisitive growth, 
achieving ‘on target’ results, increasing 
earnings, thereby achieving strong cash 
generation and maintaining a robust balance 
sheet. This enables the Board to maintain 
progressive dividend returns to shareholders.
Management and staff
At 30 September 2017, Sanderson employed 
almost 230 staff, who have a high level of 
experience and specialist expertise in the 
market sectors in which the Group operates. 
Following the acquisition of Anisa, the 
Group now has over 300 employees. The 
commitment of staff is crucial to achieving 
further progress and on behalf of the Board, 
I would again like to express our appreciation 
and thank everyone for their hard work, 
support, dedication and contribution to the 
ongoing development of the Group.
Adrian Frost, who had served as Group 
Finance Director since 2005, left Sanderson 
in September and we wish Adrian every 
success with his new employer. Richard 
Mogg joined Sanderson as Group Finance 
Director in October from Capita, where 
latterly, he worked in the Capita Education 
Software Services business. Richard’s 
considerable commercial, financial and 
business experience will further enhance the 
management team and we are very much 
looking forward to working together over the 
years to come.
