STRATEGIC REPORT
Discovery  
to delivery
In the 2016/17 financial year we made good 
progress in developing Plant Impact’s commercial 
and technical platforms to exploit the significant 
opportunity we see in crop enhancement. 
JOHN BRUBAKER
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Considerable progress has been 
made in the 2016/17 financial year in 
research and product development 
(R&D). For the first time, our R&D 
progress is enabling us to trial an 
integrated, full-season portfolio 
of four individually developed yield 
products and prototypes for soybeans. 
Ultimately, and in combination, we are 
developing them to deliver a consistent 
double-digit yield improvement for 
growers; this is without precedent 
in this category. In addition, we are 
gathering test data signalling that our 
technologies in soybeans and wheat 
could be extended to other major 
world crops like cotton, canola, corn 
and rice. Most exciting, our chemical 
discovery process has been developed 
to be highly productive in generating 
novel compound leads, which are 
showing promising performance in 
early laboratory assays. Reflecting 
this and the importance that we place 
on R&D, we have recently published 
a pipeline review that gives investors 
and industry partners improved 
visibility of where we are working 
and the progress we are making.
Successes this year have included the 
launch of Fortalis

 in North America 
and Veritas

/Fortalis

 in the Southern 
Cone of Latin America. Additionally 
we have seen growth of Banzai
™
, our 
product for cocoa in West Africa and 
made progress in developing additional 
partnerships to expand that opportunity 
in future years. We made commercial 
progress in Brazil, expanding our 
flagship product Veritas
®
 to consolidate 
a leading market position in soybean 
crop enhancement. However, we did 
not achieve the campaign plan that 
both we and Bayer CropScience (BCS),

our partner in the country, had set for 
the season. This resulted in a build 
up in channel inventory levels which 
adversely impacted BCS’s planned 
purchase volumes for the forthcoming 
2017/18 growing season. We regard 
this as a temporary setback, brought 
about by poor market conditions 
last season. Factors included poor 
crop prices, restricted availability 
of farm credit and overall poor 
economic sentiment in Brazil. 
Strategy
The Group has operated since 2011 
under a strategic plan which directed 
commercial and product development 
efforts towards building three pillars: 
sell direct to market, globalise and 
scale, and accelerate innovation. Over 
the last 12 months, we have evolved 
this strategy for the next stage of our 
development. Our update recognises 
that R&D activities are at the core of 
what we are seeking to achieve and that 
these provide the main engine for an 
appreciation in long-term shareholder 
value. This 2017 strategic plan (i) 
organises our R&D efforts to address 
specific plant physiological responses 
and resource prioritisation that limit 
crop yields, (ii) focuses these research 
efforts on soybeans and wheat, as initial 
models for dicot and monocot plant 
classes, (iii) embeds a replicable R&D 
platform approach to the discovery of 
new small molecules, (iv) concentrates 
product development on novel synthetic 
and defined chemistries, and (v) builds 
partnerships with companies that 
growers trust in order to commercialise 
products and fund further R&D.
The refined strategy forms the basis 
of a five-year business and R&D 
plan that the Group will continue to 
progress as the business develops.
