 Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Growth Strategy
The HCC business has benefited  
from a strong pipeline of territory  
builds. These are opportunities where 
experienced agents join us to build 
customer growth in specific areas. 
These agents already have an excellent 
grasp of what it takes to build good 
relationships with customers, thus 
representing a key source of premium-
quality growth. 
Technology
A strong technology platform brings  
a number of advantages. Our core 
underwriting system for HCC has a fully 
developed automated credit control 
engine at its centre. This not only 
enhances good decision making on 
the doorstep but allows the business  
to maintain compliant and highly 
personalised customer service. 
Our mobility platform integrates fully 
with our core underwriting system, and 
provides highly developed functionality 
to our field teams and agents. This has 
led to increased efficiency gains and 
has virtually eradicated paper from the 
operation, as well as giving us highly 
controlled impairment. 
Our strategy to build a digital platform 
that spans all our products and services 
is underway. This strategy will exploit

features to our customers. Crucially,  
our technology platform increases  
our potential to develop products and 
services and to embed regulatory 
compliance, to make it simpler as well  
as enforceable and auditable. It means 
that training in processes, procedures 
and behaviours can be delivered  
online, with minimal disruption to  
daily operations and management  
in the field. 
Acquisitions
Acquiring smaller businesses within 
the HCC sector is still achievable, 
but careful assessment of the quality 
of the business, timing and pricing 
are important factors in securing 
acquisitions at the right price. For the 
first time, due to the acquisition of 
Shelby Finance Limited, we are now 
able to purchase online instalment loan 
competitors, giving us more options 
to consider when selecting potential 
targets. This important activity will remain 
one of our focal areas for 2017/18.
Online Instalment Loan Product
As well as accelerating our IT platform 
capabilities, the purchase of Shelby 
Finance Limited has also provided us 
with the valuable benefit of full approval 
by the regulator in this very large 
market sector. Retraction by 
competitors, toxic brand associations 
and the need for our competitors and 
We have continued to invest  
in technology to support our 
strategic plan to offer customers 
a broader range of products  
and the ability to access credit 
more flexibly.
Paul Smith
Chief Executive Officer
In addition to the successful introduction 
of the Morses Club Card in April 2016, 
we are delighted to have launched our 
new online instalment product, Dot Dot 
Loans in March 2017 . 
We have a number of developments 
planned for the coming year as part 
of our expansion into customer rewards, 
customer communication channels, 
social media, and financial and  
card-related services.
We remain confident in our outlook, 
with a strong pipeline of territory builds 
for our growth plan, and continue to see 
attractive acquisition opportunities in the 
Home Collected Credit (HCC) and the 
wider non-standard finance markets.
Strategic Report
Morses Club PLC 12 new entrants to take volume risks, form 
a part of the competitive landscape. 
The fact that we suffer none of these 
disadvantages means that we are 
well-positioned to enter this market.
HCC Market Conditions
The HCC competitive environment 
continues to reduce, although at 
a slower rate than in previous years. 
Consumer demand continues its 
modest growth. The key drivers to 
out-performing the sector are 
technologies that will lower costs, 
increase capacity, improve productivity, 
enforce good compliance adherence 
and improve our relevance and appeal 
to younger, digitally confident 
consumers. Morses Club has already 
invested in all of these technologies and 
is reaping the rewards described, with 
8% overall growth in loans, 10% growth 
in high-quality cohorts and 5% growth 
in the under-35 market.
The business is now in a position to lower 
the cost to serve in both HCC and online 
lending markets and to improve its 
productivity. Overheads as a percentage 
of revenue have already started to fall, 
reducing to 56.9% from 58.9% in FY16. 
There is capacity for the business to 
grow using the existing field resource, 
with an increase of up to 28% in the ratio 
of customers to a business manager. 
Technology and Customer Service
We have continued to concentrate 
on using technology to help drive 
further improvements to the customer 
experience. The efficiency of our agents 
and managers has been a key focus. 
As a result of our investment in better 
technologies we can now devote more 
management time to delivering the 
right outcomes for customers, helping 
those in difficulty and supporting agent 
development. The agents themselves 
now face far less manual administration 
with the eradication of paperwork 
and the ability to sign loan agreements 
on their tablet. This in turn eases the 
business operation, improves work-life 
balance and enhances loyalty to 
Morses Club, thus reducing agent churn. 
Digitising our business has brought 
many planned and subtle advantages 
in addition to those already detailed. 
The fact that every part of the lending 
and collecting process is digitally 
and geographically time-stamped 
means that we can deliver enhanced 
management reporting from our data 
warehouse. This makes us a much more 
transparent organisation.
The platform has also allowed us to 
automate credit decisions based on 
policy with minimal levels of intervention 
or management overrides. This ensures 
responsible lending and sound 
compliance, as evidenced by our 
controlled impairment and the 
increase in the proportion of debt in 
our best performing arrears bands.
The installation of tailored risk 
management systems and complaint 
management systems illustrate how  
we have adopted the same systematic 
approach in these areas, too. Our 
committee structures, risk framework, 
corporate governance policies and 
our high-quality executive and  
non-executive Board structure all 
culminate in an approach closely 
resembling that of a large, main market 
PLC. I am proud that we are equipped 
and empowered by robust, systematised 
processes managed by highly skilled 
and ethical management teams.
The fact that we are developing our 
technology for customer interface 
and customer use is a hugely positive 
aspect of the business. The outcome 
for the customer is that Morses Club 
is more accessible as a financial option 
in their daily life. For the first time in our 
history, we can gather detailed data on 
the spending behaviour of our customer 
base. This helps us significantly in 
designing even better value-added 
services for our customers, which in 
turn will improve customer acquisition 
(particularly amongst younger 
age groups) and retain more high-
quality customers. 
Regulatory Context
I believe that the best way to create 
a positive relationship with the 
regulator is to focus on the customer. 
Our improvements and investments 
have been made with our customers’ 
satisfaction in mind. It is however no 
accident that the developments in 
which we have invested also enable 
us to be more productive, reduce our 
operating costs, re-use technology 
many times over for the same 
investment case and, of course, 
to attract and retain customers. 
The primary vision of better customer 
outcomes via technology investment will 
be the key to maintaining a harmonious 
relationship, something which I believe 
we are on course to achieve.
Marketing
Morses Club has been in existence for 
over 130 years and has strong brand 
loyalty and identity. Our website traffic 
demonstrates that this positive brand 
awareness reaches beyond the HCC 
market into the wider , non-standard 
credit market, too. This will be a major 
advantage to us as we grow our brand 
and reputation in, and potentially 
beyond, the online instalment market.
Morses Club Card
Morses Club Card is our pre-paid Visa 
debit card which allows customers to 
receive loans via card rather than cash. 
The card allows customers to pay for 
goods and services electronically as well 
as access cash via cash machines, free 
of charge. Further benefits of the card 
include greater security for agents 
and customers, as the cards are PIN 
protected. In addition, customers have 
access to an online portal, a mobile app 
as well as the opportunity to earn 
cashback from selected retailers.
E-loans
We have made a strong start in our 
diversification strategy. Our online 
lending brand launched in March 2017 .  
A fully interactive customer portal and 
downloadable mobile app will mean 
easier, two-way communication with 
customers. As the delivery and 
awareness platforms continue to 
develop, we will be able to take 
much larger strides into customer 
retail benefits (such as discounting 
and cashbacks). Our expansion of 
our Morses Club Card base, the portal 
and app platforms will allow us to 
offer simple financial services to our 
customers and we will encourage our 
customers to share their experience 
of Morses Club on social media, 
improving our reputation and relevance 
with emerging, younger markets. 
Market Opportunities
The Board remains vigilant to market 
developments that could help accelerate 
our strategy and augment our vision. 
We are currently reviewing several 
growth and diversification opportunities 
and our horizon-scanning capabilities 
will ensure that we identify and evaluate 
these opportunities as they emerge.
