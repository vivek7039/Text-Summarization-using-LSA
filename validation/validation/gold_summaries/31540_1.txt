These results are pleasing in their own right, and 
especially satisfying because they are the outcome 
of the applied skills and enormous dedication of 
our people, and of our continuing ability to meet 
new challenges while remaining true to the 
values which inspired our Company’s creation.”
 Paul Webb
 Chief Executive
We are immensely proud of the Company’s heritage, and the 
journey we have undertaken over the last 30 years.
The Company’s origins lie in a piece of innovative research & 
development work designed to tackle a major customer challenge 
at that time: the need to find a more efficient way of controlling 
and switching images in large CCTV systems. The problem was 
solved, the original customer bought the solution, another client 
quickly followed, and Synectics was born.
In many ways, the Company has changed beyond all recognition 
from that initial, experimental breakthrough, but in other, very 
important respects, it has remained constant.
Synectics’ first wave of success came primarily in the UK public 
sector, as we supported the government’s implementation of 
systems to increase the safety of public spaces throughout the 
country. However, we increasingly discovered that there were 
other sectors and other geographical markets where customers 
were seeking the sophisticated and high-quality, but easy to use, 
solutions which were becoming our stock in trade.
Our strategy has always been to focus on a limited number of 
specific industry verticals for which security, surveillance, and 
control systems are absolutely critical, organisations where often 
the stakes could not be higher. We build deep specialist knowledge 
of each of these industries, and deploy our expert teams around 
the world in the places where they are most needed and can 
deliver the greatest value to those particular customers.
Today, we serve leading organisations in the transport, oil & gas, 
gaming, critical infrastructure, and retail sectors. We have major 
regional centres in the US, Singapore, the UAE, and Germany, 
as well as in our original homeland, the UK, and from these hubs 
we serve customers in dozens of countries. We are designing 
and deploying the security systems for the new Jakarta airport; 
we provide the command and control solutions deployed across 
Berlin’s integrated transport network; we monitor over 5,000 video 
channels for one of the largest casinos in Las Vegas; we serve vast 
energy facilities in the Middle East; and we continue to protect 
many of the most important buildings and facilities in the UK, 
from nuclear power stations to national heritage sites.
However, while the scale and geographical scope of our operations 
has expanded dramatically, the core values which underpin our 
business have remained exactly the same. Right from the start, we 
have always been an innovative, problem-solving, customer-driven 
company. As we have achieved the scale required to serve some 
of the world’s largest organisations, and developed industry-leading 
technology such as our Synergy 3 platform, we have always retained 
the emphasis on technical expertise, high-quality solutions, customer 
service, and sheer human commitment which we believe make 
us distinctive.
The challenge for any business of course, and Synectics is no 
exception, is to continue to translate its inherent strengths and 
core values into products and services which meet the needs 
of a changing world.
In the security and surveillance business, change brings its 
own specific challenges. The priorities are the protection of people 
and assets, and in turn the people those assets serve. This is not 
an environment where it pays to take undue risks. The systems 
and solutions we provide must be absolutely robust, and rigorously 
proven to work under the most extreme conditions – and they are. 
However, technology is now advancing at such speed, on so 
many fronts, that it is provoking us and our customers to rethink 
the way we tackle problems, and offering us many ways to do 
things better. At the same time, technology alters or expands 
the nature of the risks against which we protect. Our customers 
are constantly having to adapt to new types of potential threat. 07

Strategic review
The sheer breadth and pace of technological change is 
unprecedented. Artificial intelligence, driverless vehicles, 
the internet of things, cyber security, 3D printing, the platform 
economy, the cloud, and many other strands have become an 
increasing part not just of the technical dictionary but of everyday 
vocabulary, to say nothing of the potential of vast databases 
which still remain largely underutilised.
While the potential of new technologies is often identified quite 
early in their evolution, the way in which people adopt, combine, 
and apply them can be less easy to foresee. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that when we talk to our customers about how their 
world is changing and what they will need from us in the future, 
one word which keeps coming up is ‘agility’. Our clients expect 
change to be rapid, dramatic and, above all, unpredictable, both 
in terms of new risks against which they may need to protect, 
and the opportunities to harness capabilities in innovative 
and practical ways to provide better solutions.
Another theme which comes through repeatedly is intuitiveness, 
the requirement for specialist systems to be easy and instinctive 
to use. Integration of data and openness of systems are also high 
on the list of requirements. Pre-emption, too, is another strong 
theme as our clients assess the potential applications of artificial 
intelligence for anticipating threats and responding proactively.
At Synectics, we see that the qualities our customers are seeking 
in this dynamic, unpredictable future are exactly those which 
characterised the birth of our Company 30 years ago. 
These include the agility that comes when world-class technical 
expertise is combined with passionate human commitment; the 
ability to innovate in practical ways and apply emerging technologies 
to solve new problems; the willingness above all to see our customers 
and their customers as people, and to do our utmost to make them 
safer and enable them to prosper and enjoy their lives.
Our business has made further strides over the past year. As 
you will find documented elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are 
pleased to report a substantially improved profit performance and 
a solid balance sheet. These results are pleasing in their own right, 
and especially satisfying because they are the outcome of the 
applied skills and enormous dedication of our people, and of 
our continuing ability to meet new challenges while remaining 
true to the values which inspired our Company’s creation.
We and our customers will face many new demands in the coming 
years as we seek to harness the potential of exciting technologies 
to provide new solutions in a profoundly uncertain world. I am 
confident that we have the capabilities, the expertise, and the 
culture to rise to these challenges.

Chief Executive’s statement continued
We serve our customers through two business models.
Our Systems businesses, marketed under the Synectics brand, 
secure major contracts for the design, development, and deployment 
of security and surveillance solutions founded on our Synergy 3 
platform. We identify future opportunities at an early stage, and work 
closely with customers to create solutions tailored to their needs.
Our Integration & Managed Services (‘IMS’) business, trading under 
the Quadrant Security Group (‘Quadrant’) and SSS Management 
Services (‘SSS’) brands, serves customers by designing security, 
surveillance, and facilities management solutions, and then 
implementing, maintaining, and supporting them over time.
By adhering closely to our principles, we benefit from high levels 
of contract renewal and recommendations to new clients.
We have already highlighted the technological changes impacting 
our customers and our own business. The transformations we are 
witnessing on many fronts will inevitably influence the way that we, 
and other players in our industry, operate in the future.
For example, hardware costs will continue to fall over time, as even 
the most specialist equipment benefits from new technologies and 
efficiencies. In our view, the real value differentiators in our industry 
already reside in the expertise to design and deliver lasting solutions 
to complex problems and in the delivery of consistently excellent 
service. These will continue to grow in importance in all areas 
of our business.
Offering two complementary service models allows us the 
flexibility to work with each of our customers in the way that best 
suits them. It also creates benefits from a commercial standpoint. 
Although the Systems business is built around long-term client 
relationships, much of the activity itself is project based, affording 
the opportunity to secure large new streams of work and drive 
growth. The IMS business includes a significant proportion of 
continuous contractual commitments, with the advantages 
these bring for resource planning and financial forecasting.
This combination of commercial stability and excellent growth 
potential makes Synectics plc an attractive proposition for investors. 
It also represents a powerful proposition for our customers, who 
value the agility and problem solving we provide alongside our 
reputation for consistency and durability. It allows us to offer our 
employees exciting opportunities, short and long term, within 
a culture which values and rewards their commitment.
