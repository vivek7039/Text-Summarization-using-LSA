 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Our priority remains on the business elements within our 
control, delivering on each of the four pillars of our strategy:
 — continuing to improve our core UK and Spanish retail 
businesses, based around the evolving needs and behaviours 
of customers
 — expanding the Group’s live and online gaming services 
for gamers and publishers 
 — developing and growing the Group’s digital enterprise services
 — optimising organisational efficiency while investing 
for the future.
At the core of this activity is our drive to reposition the business 
to address the changing consumer preferences and behaviours 
within our industry, and we are making good progress in 
this regard. Over the period, we have rapidly developed our 
live gaming operations, opening 18 BELONG gaming arenas; 
launched a major new membership scheme in the UK – 
‘GAME Elite’; successfully developed new retail categories 
and services; delivered a number of improvements to the 
omni-channel customer journey, including an enhanced Click 
& Collect service and new Reserve & Collect offer; hosted our 
largest ever Insomnia Gaming Festival and doubled sales from 
our digital enterprise businesses.
Whilst we have continued to invest in the long-term 
development of the business, we have also maintained strong 
capital discipline and cost control, with significant cost savings 
achieved across our UK retail operations in the year.
To this end, and on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our 
management team and our colleagues, in every region and part 
of the business, for their hard work and dedication in driving 
forwards our strategy.
Performance
Despite the strong sales performance in the second half, 
up 7.8%, Group revenues fell 3.6% over the year as a whole, 
to £782.9 million.
As reported, trading conditions in the UK market were 
undoubtedly tough in the first six months of the year. Whilst 
the arrival of the Nintendo Switch in March 2017 brought new 
impetus and growth to our markets, limited supply in the first 
few weeks of launch meant we did not achieve our internal 
expectations for the UK business.
The Spanish market has continued to perform well and 
this helped our Spanish retail business deliver a strong 
performance, with record sales achieved in the year. 
We also achieved excellent growth in our newer Events, Esports 
& Digital businesses, although at this time these areas remain 
relatively small in the context of the overall Group. 
John Jackson
Chairman
The markets in which we operate remain 
both fast-paced and fast-changing, 
and whilst the market environment was 
once again challenging for our UK retail 
business in the year, particularly the first 
half, it has been a period of important 
strategic progress for the Group, with 
strong developments on many fronts.

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Balance sheet and capital allocation 
A strong balance sheet is a key part of any Company’s 
success and the Board is committed to ensuring it continues 
to strengthen its position whilst supporting the requisite 
investment to transform the Group that will ultimately lead 
to sustainable returns to shareholders. After investing 
£11.6 million in the business during the year, we ended the 
period with a cash position (net of overdrafts) of £47.2 million, 
up from £43.1 million last year. 
The Board is committed to a dividend policy which reflects 
the long-term earnings and cash generation potential of the 
Group, after retaining sufficient capital to fund future business 
growth. This commitment has seen over £57 million returned 
to shareholders by way of ordinary and special dividends since 
the Group’s flotation in 2014. 
At the time of our half year results in March, the Board 
announced a reduction in the interim dividend payment. 
This reflected the decision to prioritise investment in BELONG 
and the continued UK store optimisation programme, given the 
extremely short lease profile of the UK estate. This work has 
intensified over the last six months and, accordingly, the Board 
has taken the decision not to declare a final dividend for the 
year (2016: 1.75 pence per share) in order that it can continue 
to prioritise the allocation of capital to these areas over the 
next 12 months.
Board
As reported, I took up the role of Chairman of GAME Digital 
following the Group’s AGM in January 2017, having joined the 
Board at the time of the Group’s IPO in 2014. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank my predecessor, David Hamid, for his 
contribution to the business since his initial involvement in 2013.
Looking forward
GAME Digital is a remarkable company, with great people 
and a strong and recognisable brand and it is building on 
this. Like many companies, we operate in dynamic markets 
and Martyn and the senior team have set out a clear strategy 
to address the challenges these dynamics present whilst 
capitalising on the opportunities, and we remain optimistic 
in the long-term prospects for the Group.
While we take nothing for granted, and recognise the potential 
challenges and risks that lie ahead, the Board believes we have 
the right strategy and a strong and experienced team to lead the 
organisation successfully through this transformational period 
for the Group.
