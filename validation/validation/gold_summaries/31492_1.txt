 05 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
To what extent will online estate agencies threaten 
the traditional estate and lettings agency business? 
Traditional estate agents, as opposed to exclusively online 
estate agency businesses, handle over 90% of property 
transactions in the UK. Vendors, especially landlords, continue 
to value the local expertise and cost effectiveness available 
across our network of offices. 
Online agents have succeeded in lowering the public’s expectation 
of how much they should be paying for estate agency services. 
As a relatively new entrant to estate agency, downward pressure 
on fees has not negatively impacted our business and in fact, 
having adjusted for the full year impact of Northwood, we are 
still 10% up year on year on MSF from estate agency.
What impact do you see Brexit having on the 
property market? 
There has been no discernible impact from the transition 
towards Brexit. Whilst during 2017 a slow down in the property 
market was anticipated, the number of property transactions 
remained surprisingly stable and was only 1% down year on year 
and changes in our business model has meant that network 
revenue from estate agency increased. In our opinion the reason 
that property transactions remained stable in 2017 was due to 
two main factors: supply and demand, and access to relatively 
cheap mortgage lending.
There continues to be a shortage of suitable housing within the 
UK for either home ownership or to rent, and given that EU 
nationals currently living in the UK will have the same residency 
rights after Brexit, there is no foreseeable reduction in the 
current level of demand for housing. So, whilst any uncertainty 
could have a short-term impact, the longer-term dynamics 
remain the same.
Do you think the upcoming ban on tenancy fees 
is the right solution to make renting more secure 
for tenants? 
No. It has been widely commented on in the press that the tenancy 
fee ban will simply increase the cost of renting for many tenants. 
There are a number of Government consultations happening 
as we speak, as policy makers recognise the importance of the 
private rented sector (PRS). It is likely that with the introduction 
of redress for tenants from DIY landlords, licensing for agents and 
the possibility of longer tenancies, standards of accommodation 
are likely to increase and encourage more people to use a 
well-functioning PRS, similar to other European countries. 
Do you expect the size of the PRS to increase 
or decrease in the next ten years?
The PRS will undoubtedly continue to grow, both in terms 
of the number of properties in the PRS and also the number 
of properties in the social housing sector.

What changes might encourage private landlords 
to use a lettings agent?
Increased regulation around property letting and licensing 
for both agents and landlords is likely to make the prospect 
of renting property without the involvement of a fully qualified 
agent less attractive. Recent proposals that private landlords 
should be subject to a redress scheme, as is already applicable 
to lettings agents, will add to the risk and cost profile for private 
landlords such that the negatives of managing their portfolio 
themselves will start to outweigh the positives.
How does the volatility of house prices affect Belvoir? 
As far as the rental sector is concerned, Belvoir has traded 
successfully, delivering year-on-year growth since 1995, during 
which time house prices have both fallen, as in the period between 
2007 and 2010, and risen well above general inflation, as during 
the late 1990s and early 2000s. 
As far as estate agency is concerned, during a period where prices 
are falling typically the number of transactions also falls as sellers 
are less willing to sell their property at a lower price, or at a loss, 
and this will impact on estate agents. However, if properties are 
more difficult to sell, vendors are more likely to use a proactive 
local estate agent to ensure they get the best price possible.
Do you expect to see more or fewer lettings agents 
in the future? 
We predict that the number of lettings agencies will reduce by 
20% in the next three years. There are simply too many estate 
and lettings agents in the UK, which we see as a significant 
opportunity for a network of our strength. Since 2014 our 
Assisted Acquisitions programme has enabled 44 franchised 
businesses across all of our networks to grow their businesses 
and increase their market share by acquiring their competition.

Capitalising on opportunities 
as the industry evolves
In a changing market, our franchise network benefits 
from the agility of franchise owners coupled with a central 
support system to give us an edge over both the large 
corporate networks and small independent operators.
MSF growth 
Management service fees (MSF) increased by 23% to £7.9m 
(2016: £6.4m). These fees are collected by each network as a 
royalty for providing a brand, a system and the considerable 
know-how for a franchisee to operate a profitable business at local 
office level. The increase in MSF reflects growth across our existing 
network of offices and a full year’s contribution from Northwood. 
Lettings 
Like Belvoir, Northwood has a strong lettings background which 
is evident in lettings now representing 80% (2016: 76%) of our 
network revenue, providing a reliable and recurring income from 
a nationwide portfolio of 58,020 (2016: 55,576) rented properties. 
Belvoir’s Rental Index for the final quarter of 2017 confirms that rents 
are rising broadly in line with average wages. Belvoir has 300 
offices nationwide and data for those offices that have traded 
consistently over the last nine years in England, Wales and Scotland 
indicate a year-on-year (YoY) increase in average rents of 2% from 
£744 in Q4 2016 to £759 in Q4 2017 whereas average earnings 
increased 2.5% YoY according to ONS figures
1
. Average rents including 
all Belvoir offices range from £597 per month in the North West 
(down 5% YoY), up to £657 in the East Midlands (up 6% YoY) and 
through to £1,046 in the South East (up 7% YoY) and £1,431 in London 
(down 5% YoY).
Property sales 
Our main estate agency network, Newton Fallowell, achieved a 10% 
growth in revenue from property sales whilst the lettings-biased 
networks, Belvoir and Northwood-branded offices, saw property 
sales MSF increase by 47% and 7% respectively. The ability of our 
traditional lettings agents to be able to process property sales is 
critical to retaining the ongoing portfolio of managed properties, 
with most landlords looking first to sell through their lettings agent. 
Where the new owner is a landlord buyer, there is a strong probability 
of retaining the vast majority of their properties under management. 
Financial services
Financial services were identified as a means of increasing the 
return from property sales that would benefit both franchisee and 
franchisor. The acquisition of Brook represented an opportunity to 
bring into the Group a very successful business with a track record 
in the financial services sector. The Board believes that the focused 
approach operated by Brook will enable the Group to achieve 
materially greater penetration of Belvoir’s client base and increase 
the financial services fees generated on property sales across all 
Group networks. As our lettings-biased networks, Belvoir and 
Northwood, grow their property sales business, Brook will enable 
our brands to increase further their revenue from estate agency-
related services and mitigate some of the impact of the upcoming 
ban on tenant fees. Additionally, Brook will be able to make 
immediate inroads into the Group’s main estate agency network, 
Newton Fallowell, by increasing the available number of mortgage 
advisors to service its substantial house sales transactions.
Acquisitions
2017 saw a record number of portfolio acquisitions at a franchisee 
level under the Assisted Acquisitions programme, a core part of the 
Group’s growth strategy. The Board’s target of doubling the number of 
transactions under this programme was significantly exceeded with 23 
(2016: nine) independent agencies being acquired. These acquisitions 
were undertaken by one Newton Fallowell, eight Belvoir and 14 
Northwood franchisees and added £3.3m (2016: £1.5m) to network 
revenue, 2,264 managed properties and £351,000 (2016: £243,000) 
p.a. in MSF. 
There remain over 10,000 potential acquisition targets comprising 
small to medium-sized independent lettings and sales agents in the 
UK, which might look to exit following increased regulation and the 
prospect of the ban on tenant fees in 2019. Our dedicated in-house 
acquisitions team currently has 73 franchises registered on the Assisted 
Acquisitions programme and 17 opportunities under consideration.
A growing business 
Our growth depends directly on the entrepreneurial drive of our 
franchisees and, unlike many franchise offerings, our model offers 
our franchisees both a revenue stream from their business and a 
capital value on exit. In order to maximise our growth potential, we 
have recently launched a new strategy to enable existing franchisees 
to expand into an adjacent empty territory. Franchisees can appoint 
a suitable business partner to work the new territory from home 
as a satellite of their existing franchise office which would provide 
all back office support. The focus will be on establishing a reliable 
revenue stream within the first three years, after which a high street 
office would be opened in the new territory to ensure that the 
business could fulfil its maximum growth potential. Our successful 
strategy of growing our network organically with single and 
multi-unit operators and by acquisition continues to evolve to 
ensure we improve our physical footprint and brand awareness.
Corporate offices
In 2016 the Board determined to implement a franchise solution 
for eight of its ten corporate-owned offices, retaining the two 
original Grantham-based Belvoir and Newton Fallowell offices, 
both of which are very profitable, to be used for system development 
purposes. This process is now complete, with four offices having 
been sold in 2016, two in 2017 and the final two in the first quarter 
of 2018. Of these, three were sold to adjacent franchisees, two to the 
existing branch manager, and three to a new franchise owner. In 
one case the new owner was already operating two existing lettings 
businesses, which will now be rebranded to Belvoir. The Board 
sees this as a way of bringing fresh impetus to these offices and 
freeing the Board to focus on the Group’s franchising operations. 07 Annual report and accounts 2017 Belvoir Lettings plc
Acquisition strategy
Having raised £5.0m through equity in 2013 to fund the Assisted Acquisitions 
programme, we have since provided both commercial and financial support to 45 
of our franchisees, many of whom have doubled the size of their business overnight 
through a portfolio acquisition. Each year between £0.7m and £1.0m is repaid by 
franchisees which is then available to fund further portfolio acquisitions, and around 
£0.3m is received in interest on the loan book. The success of our franchisees in 
securing alternative funding means that each year we have been able to support 
a larger number of transactions from the same funding base. The Board has once 
again doubled the Assisted Acquisitions target and so far in 2018 has completed 
on eight transactions totalling £3.3m, which will bring in £2.8m of network revenue 
and 2,238 managed properties.
Compliance 
The Belvoir Group has built its reputation by delivering a highly 
professional lettings and estate agency service which embraces 
the principles of specialism, quality and customer care. Compliance 
is at the top of our agenda with all franchisees undergoing a training 
programme and ongoing business support and every office being 
audited annually to ensure strict adherence to our high operational 
standards and current legislation. This is increasingly important as 
the Government looks to professionalise the PRS sector through 
greater regulation and control. The Board welcomes the Government’s 
initiatives that we believe will deter rogue landlords and agents.
Market conditions
The size of the PRS in the UK has been steadily increasing for 
over a decade, resulting in the PRS representing 20% of the total 
households. A lack of affordable housing, static wages and indeed 
personal choice are causing the PRS to cater for a wider reaching 
demographic including families, professionals and even retirees. 
For this reason the PRS is evolving, the average tenancy is now just 
under four years and many people are turning to lettings, looking 
for their long-term stable home. In line with these changes, tenants 
are expecting a much higher standard of property and service 
from their agent meaning a reputable, professional agent is more 
important than ever for landlords to attract the right tenant. 
Impacting on this shift is the added increase in regulation of the 
lettings industry imposed by the Government. These changes are 
already leading to consolidation in the lettings market as smaller 
independent agents look to exit, leaving market share for our 
franchisees to capitalise on either organically or directly through 
our Assisted Acquisitions programme. 
Some of the changes in our industry such as the upcoming ban 
on tenant fees will certainly be a challenge for our business but 
robust plans have been in place ever since the ban was announced 
to give franchisees additional opportunities such as property sales 
to mitigate the loss in revenue. 
The sales market in the UK has been fairly uneventful with unchanged 
transaction numbers and a modest increase in house prices of 
5.2% during 2017. This result was more positive than anticipated 
though and was probably due to supply and demand with net 
migration exceeding the number of new builds completed in 2017. 
The Group’s performance in property sales was very positive in 
2017 with an increase in MSF of 21%. Our relatively small reliance 
on the property sales market and the fact that the majority of our 
franchisees are offering sales as an additional service alongside a 
very stable lettings business mean there is only really upside for 
us with property sales. The acquisition of Brook also helped us 
build on this opportunity, as franchisees can generate additional 
revenue from each house sale whilst offering their clients a more 
comprehensive property service. 
Franchising 
In 2016 the British Franchising Association and NatWest jointly 
reported that the franchising industry was estimated to be worth 
£15.1bn to the UK economy, an increase of 46% over the last 
ten years. The increasing popularity of franchising was linked 
to the greater chance of financial success with a record 97% of 
franchisee-owned units reported profitability, with 56% saying 
they are “quite” or “very” profitable. Franchising offers a relatively 
low risk way for young people to get into business with one in five 
franchise owners launching their business in the last two years 
being under the age of 30. It also offers opportunity for scale 
with 29% of franchises running multiple outlets.
Current trading and outlook 
2018 has started well with eight franchisees having completed 
on portfolio acquisitions estimated to bring in a total of £2.8m p.a. 
of additional network revenue, taking the Group to 42% of our 
2018 target within Q1. Furthermore, despite the anticipated slow 
down in house sales, our main estate agency network, Newton 
Fallowell, has reported on both sales subject to contract and its 
pipeline being ahead of 2017. Our investment in Brook to deliver a 
planned increase in revenue from financial services is proving to 
be a success with the value of mortgages written and net banking 
up 30% through a combination of a greater number of mortgages 
being written, a higher penetration from life policies and an increased 
average case value on the same period last year. We do anticipate 
some tempering of the underlying organic growth of the lettings 
market with YoY average rent increases reported at 2% in Q4 2017 
and evidence of slightly longer void periods between tenancies 
in some regions. However, given the shortfall of properties available 
to buy continuing to fuel demand within the PRS and the additional 
legislative demands on both lettings agents and private landlords 
seeing an increase in the need for a qualified, well-supported 
agent, we believe that our franchisees are in a good position to 
capitalise on the opportunities within the sector and anticipate 
a further year of positive growth for the Belvoir Group.
