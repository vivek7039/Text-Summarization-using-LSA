VERTICALLY INTEGRATED  
BUSINESS MODEL:
Recycling, manufacturing and own 
distribution network
We are a leading manufacturer of rigid and foam 
PVC profiles. Our recycling operation helps to 
lower material costs and improve production 
stability. Our branches are conveniently located, 
offering a wide range of products and providing 
excellent service to local customers and 
nationwide groups alike.
  See Our Business Model on page 12
SUSTAINABLE OPERATION:
In-house, closed loop  
recycling facility
We recycle both customer factory offcuts 
(‘post-industrial’ waste) and old windows (‘post-
consumer’ waste). The recycled material is used 
to generate brand new extruded plastic products.

management team with the requisite and 
complementary skills, knowledge and experience

Against a more challenging economic 
backdrop, we have reported robust 
financial results and delivered another 
consistent operational performance.
I am pleased to report we have made

Financial and Operating Performance
Our sales growth was good at +10% (+8% excluding 
acquisitions), with market share gains across the business. 
Profitability was solid, having been impacted by a subdued 
RMI market, especially in the second half, and higher raw 
material cost inflation.
As a result, we reported adjusted profit before tax of 
£24.5 million, up 1% on last year. Reported profit before  
tax of £23.7 million is down 0.7% on last year.
Cash conversion remains solid, with underlying operating 
cash flow of £28.8 million (2016: £32.2 million) driving a 
reduction in net debt to £14.5 million (31 December 2016: 
£20.3 million). We have a strong balance sheet which 
provides flexibility and options for the future.
In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of Security 
Hardware Limited, a supplier of locks and hardware primarily 
to the RMI market, with annual sales of approximately  
£3 million. The integration is now substantially complete.
Strategy
In January 2018, building on the work done in 2017, we 
conducted a review of the Company’s strategy and the 
fundamental elements of our markets and activities. At the 
conclusion of this process, we reaffirmed that our overall 
objective remains to deliver sustainable growth in 
Shareholder value by increasing sales and profits at above 
our market level growth rates.
We have five clear strategic priorities to help us achieve our 
overall objective:
• Target growth in market share.
• Expand our branch network.
• Increase the use of recycled materials.
• Develop innovative new products.
• Explore potential bolt-on acquisitions.
We made good progress with each of these priorities 
during 2017, with the key aspects of our performance 
described in the Chief Executive’s Review and in Our 
Strategy.
Looking forward, we will continue to develop each of these 
areas. We expect the significant investments now made in 
our specifications teams and in expanding the branch 
network will deliver further gains in market share. In addition, 
in response to continued raw material cost inflation, we 
intend to place more emphasis on increasing the use of 
recycled materials in our manufacturing processes.
Governance
As a Board, we are committed to promoting the highest 
standards of corporate governance and ensuring effective 
communication with Shareholders. We continue to comply 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code as outlined in  
our Corporate Governance Statement on pages 43 to 45.
Dividends
We paid an interim dividend of 3.0 pence per share.  
The Board proposes a final dividend of 6.0 pence  
per share, resulting in total dividends for the year of  
9.0 pence, representing growth of 6%.
People
The good progress and robust financial results we reported 
in 2017 are a direct result of the hard work and dedication of 
our teams in every part of our business. On your behalf  
and on behalf of the Board, I offer our sincere thanks.
