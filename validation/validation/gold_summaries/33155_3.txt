68 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 BOARD EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
Our General Counsel and Company Secretary, Sarah Booth, 
facilitated the 2015 Board effectiveness review. In it, Directors 
discussed various topics focused on themes drawn from the Code. 
These included how the Board works together, influences 
Hammerson’s culture and values, sets the Company’s strategic 
aims and assesses risk. She reviewed the responses and discussed 
them with me before tabling a report and recommendations to the 
Board. Actions were agreed and incorporated where appropriate 
into the 2016 Board work plan. These included:
 – Further enhancements to our strategic planning process;
 – Continued focus on the talent-development aspects of 
succession planning;
 – A presentation by external advisers to the Board on culture  
and ethics;
 – An on-going programme of engagement and site visits; and
 – Preparation of a list of discussion topics for Board dinners.
Progress on the actions arising from the 2014 Board effectiveness 
review was also considered as part of the 2015 review. Further 
details can be found in this report as set out below: 
 – Succession planning – see Nomination Committee Report,  
page 79 .
 – Improving the structure of the Board strategy day – see page 76.
 – Further engagement with colleagues – see page 76.
The next Board effectiveness review will take place in 2016 and 
will be conducted by an external facilitator.
I would like to conclude by thanking my colleagues on the Board, 
the management team and all our colleagues in the Group for 
delivering yet another strong performance in 2015.

We have recently seen a much greater recognition among the 
investor community of the importance of corporate culture in 
how businesses manage risk and secure a strong performance. In 
part, this is being driven by the Financial Reporting Council which 
has a major initiative under way on this topic. 
I believe that strong corporate governance, underpinned by a 
sound culture, is fundamental to our success and helps ensure we 
can meet our business goals and generate value over the longer 
term. Your Board plays a key role in shaping Hammerson’s culture 
both in the boardroom and across the wider organisation. 
During the year, the Board considered as part of the 2015 Board 
effectiveness review how effectively it sets the tone from the top. 
You can read more about this in the Board’s roundtable discussion 
on page 70. The Board also had a number of opportunities during 
the year to engage with colleagues across the business, both 
formally and informally. These meetings gave Directors further 
insight into how Hammerson’s values are embedded in the 
business and you can read more about this on page 75.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
Effective boards need directors who bring the right balance of 
skills, experience and knowledge, enhanced by a range of diverse 
backgrounds. During the year, we welcomed two new Non-
Executive Directors to the Board, Pierre Bouchut and Andrew 
Formica. The work associated with making changes to the Board 
and monitoring succession planning across the business were 
important elements of the Nomination Committee’s activity – 
further details can be found on page 78.
Jacques Espinasse will retire from the Board at the conclusion  
of this year’s Annual General Meeting, after nine years of service 
as a Non-Executive Director. He has also been a member of the  
Audit Committee since 2007 , and chaired that Committee since 
April 2014. I would like to record my thanks to Jacques for the 
significant and valuable contribution he has made to the Board 
and the Company.
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Hammerson’s Corporate 
Governance Report which aims to provide an insight into how the Board spent 
its time during 2015. As in previous years, details of how we discharged our 
governance duties and applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) are contained in a separate section from page 102. 
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Company complied in full with the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code published in September 
2014 which applied throughout the financial year ended  
31 December 2015.
