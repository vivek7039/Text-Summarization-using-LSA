 Bringing the 
digital twin to life
We have made good progress in realigning our 
business around our two core products. 
Market opportunity 
Ubisense excels at helping customers to convert 
their physical worlds into a living, breathing digital 
twin of their core operational assets, products and 
processes. In fact, Lockheed Martin, a giant in the 
aerospace industry, recently listed digital twins as the 
number one technology trend of 2018. This is why in 
2017 we have sold more of our own products to 
more customers. 
Looking at the trends in our main markets of automotive, 
aerospace, telecoms and utilities we see some 
common challenges such as increased competition 
from globalisation, more demanding technical savvy 
customers and ageing workforces with skill gaps. 
However, as we look more closely within our target 
segments we also see some very positive indicators 
including automotive manufacturing output at an all-time 
high of 93.5m units

, aircraft order backlogs at an all-time 
high of 8-10 years

 and global rollout plans for millions 
of homes worldwide to be connected to fibre 
broadband services in the next few years. 
These long term trends are creating tremendous 
opportunities for us. This is why Lockheed Martin has 
trusted Ubisense with its mission critical function of 
controlling all shop floor tool operations for its high 
profile F-35 fighter program. This is also why Daimler 
has standardised every plant worldwide to work with 
our SmartSpace software to deliver their global vision 
of a “paperless factory”. And this is why one of the 
largest North American utilities business has employees 
using our myWorld solution every day.
Our solutions are chosen because they combine 
industry-leading technology that includes: indoor 
and outdoor geolocation, wirelessly enabled 
machine-to-machine and machine-to-device 
communication, advanced analytics and big 
data middleware. 
Underlying strategic focus
Our progress in 2017 can most easily be measured 
by observing the percentage of revenue our own 
products generate. For 2017 I am proud to report 
that not only did we break the 50% barrier but that 
we exceeded 60%. This important shift in our revenue 
mix  has been achieved by focusing on a 
three-point strategy:
1. Refocusing the business: 
Since 2016 we have been growing our focus on 
own-product sales into four main verticals: automotive, 
aerospace, telecoms and utilities. In doing so we are 
actively managing out our legacy third-party Geospatial 
service business which has now been reduced 
by 22% year on year. This has allowed greater 
management focus on building a stronger business 
that is based on our own products. Our goal is to 
become a market standard in each of our chosen 
verticals, we are focusing on the top global quartile 
of our selected market, which means concentrating 
our efforts on a group of approximately 200 global 
companies worldwide. 
Focusing ensures that we develop a deeper 
understanding of our chosen markets. In 2017 
we seeded our product roadmaps with extensive 
customer research which has helped us understand 
new areas where existing and prospective customers 
are facing specific problems. This market research 
has led to the launch of important new products 
in both product lines and increased pipeline 
generation. By increasing our focus on specific 
verticals we have been able to offer existing 
customers new product roadmaps that align with 
their challenges, and give new customers reasons 
to adopt Ubisense technology.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT Real progress towards our 
goal of revolutionising the 
world’s ability to locate, 
connect and manage 
industrial assets.”
Financial results
The repositioning work has allowed us to increase 
the percentage of software across the board and in 
a typical transaction software will be the dominant 
source of revenue and margin. This ability to drive 
software sales underpins our goal of increasing 
margin and recurring revenue by way of maintenance 
and support services.
With respect to financial performance, we were 
able to grow our top line to £27.3 million, more than 
overcoming the decline in our legacy third party 
service revenues. This top line growth is thanks to the 
increased sales of our own products, which grew at 
an impressive rate of 28%. Our margins made some 
positive progress which will improve further as the 
momentum builds from the sales of our own products. 
Above all, the Ubisense team continues to work hard 
to deliver improved returns for your investment.

2.  Improved sales execution: 
Within our own organisation we have strengthened 
our go-to-market capabilities by recruiting market 
leading sales, pre-sales and marketing talent over 
2017 and we have invested in training to help our 
organisation successfully complete complex 
multi-stakeholder buying processes. 
As a result of this we have seen a significant shift in 
the shape of our pipeline, and across both business 
lines we have seen increases in the number of 
opportunities in the £250K–£1m band by an average 
of 115% and the £1M+ band by 25%. We have also 
increased our presence in new markets such 
as Thailand and Turkey by signing new distribution 
agreements with carefully selected partners that 
have both sales and delivery capabilities into our 
strategic markets of automotive, aerospace, 
telecoms and utilities. 
3. Repositioning the product portfolio: 
Thanks to our renewed engagement with our chosen 
markets we have invested in the development of our 
two enterprise class software solutions: SmartSpace 
and myWorld. Both product sets have been elevated 
from a positioning perspective so that our ability 
to solve enterprise level problems are more clearly 
communicated to our target markets. This elevation 
takes the form of positioning our products in the context 
of enterprise systems already in place (in manufacturing, 
for example, this is referred to as the ‘manufacturing 
enterprise systems stack’) and targeting our messaging 
directly at specific job roles. 
In addition to elevating the two products, we have 
invested in modularising them, separating functionality 
into applications which can be packaged to address 
customer specific needs. This approach allows us to 
position both products along the value chains of our 
target market and illustrates how our products can 
improve core operations at each node in the value 
chain of their added-value operations. By positioning 
our product along the value chain we have been able 
to offer specific solutions to the challenges in particular 
areas, thereby eliminating the need to purchase 
enterprise licenses to solve discrete problems and 
preserving more value for future sales.
