Chief Executive’s Strategic Review
Introduction 
It is an honour to have been selected to 
lead Vesuvius and I am grateful to our 
Chairman, John McDonough, and the 
Board of Directors for their trust.
I would also like to thank François 
Wanecq for his exceptional commitment 
in leading Vesuvius over the past 1 2 years. 
Thanks to his achievements and the 
efforts of all our teams, the foundations 
of the Group are strong and sound. 
Our main objective is now to build on 
these foundations and to generate 
and accelerate the Group’s profitable 
growth over the coming years.
The strong performance of the Group 
in 2017 is an important first step in the 
implementation of this growth strategy.
Strong Performance
In a globally favourable economic 
environment, both our Steel and Foundry 
Divisions succeeded in outperforming 
the general market growth. This was 
particularly the case in China.
Thanks to this performance, Vesuvius’ 
global sales in 2017 reached £1,683.9m, 
an increase of 20.2% over 2016 on a 
reported basis. At constant currency, 
and adjusted for the effect of acquisitions, 
underlying revenue was up 12.5% as 
compared with 2016. 
Our trading profit in 2017 reached 
£165.5m, an increase of 24.2% over 2016 
on a reported basis and 16. 1% on an 
underlying basis. Our return on sales 
improved from 9.5% to 9.8%. After the 
inclusion of amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and restructuring costs, 
operating profit was £109.7m, 18. 1% 
ahead of prior year on a reported basis.
Our financial performance would, 
however, have been even stronger in 
2017 if we had not been impacted by 
two temporary headwinds.
Some of the key raw materials used 
by our Steel and Foundry Divisions 
experienced significant price increases in 
2017 , particularly during the second half 
of the year. The speed of these increases 
was such that it was not possible to fully 
recover the increased costs through the 
sales price of our finished products, as we 
were bound by contractual obligations 
with some customers. This situation 
improved towards the end of 2017 due 
to prices stabilising for several key raw 
materials and major progress being 
made in recovering cost inflation through 
higher selling prices. Whilst the price of 
magnesite, the largest contributor to 
raw material price inflation in 2017 , 
has now stabilised, the price of other 
raw materials such as bauxite, silicon 
carbide and zirconia are still on an 
upward trend. As a result, the process 
of price adjustment will continue into 
2018, until realised cost increases have 
been fully recovered. 
Additionally, the very strong growth 
of our Flow Control sales in EMEA 
temporarily exceeded the capacity of 
our manufacturing plants in the region, 
requiring the import of products from our 
facilities in Asia and NAFT A, incurring 
additional freight, export duty and 
overtime costs. Measures were 
immediately taken to increase the 
capacity of the Flow Control EMEA 
plants and this ramp-up is now  
complete, substituting imports from 
non-EMEA plants.
Improved Financial Position
Despite the strong growth in our turnover 
and increased capital investment of 
£44.3m in 2017 versus £35.2m in 2016, 
our cash conversion ratio increased to 
104% in 2017 due to our focus on efficient 
working capital management. Our trade 
working capital to sales ratio decreased 
to 24.9% from 26.6% in 2016. 
This strong cash flow generation 
reduced our net debt to £274.3m at 
31 December 2017 versus £320.3m 
at 31 December 2016. We also partly 
refinanced our debt in December 2017 
with the issuance of a €100m US Private 
Placement, resulting in a significant 
decrease of our financing costs 
going forward.
Strategic Progress
Our strategy remains centred around 
five key execution priorities, designed 
to ensure the achievement of our core 
strategic objectives of delivering long-term, 
sustainable and profitable growth.
Each of these execution priorities saw 
significant progress in 2017:
>  Reinforce our technology leadership: 
With a global R&D spend of £33.2m in 
2017 (2016:£28.6m), representing 
2.0% of revenue, Vesuvius continues to 
lead the industry with a significantly 
larger R&D spend to sales ratio than 
most of our competitors. In 2017 , 
 “Our main objective is to 
accelerate the implementation 
of our profitable growth  
strategy over the coming years”
Patrick André Chief Executive 19
we continued to focus our R&D efforts 
on a reduced number of potentially 
high-impact R&D programmes. 
The new Advanced Refractory R&D 
centre in Visakhapatnam, India, was 
inaugurated in November, reinforcing 
our presence in this key market for our 
future growth, strengthening links with 
customers and enabling us to better 
tap into the growing talent pool of 
engineers and scientists in the country. 
The decision was also made to 
reorganise the Flow Control R&D 
network around three main R&D 
centres; in the US (Pittsburgh), Europe 
(Ghlin/Feignies) and China (Suzhou), 
operating under a common leadership. 
This structure will be fully operational 
in 2020 and will enable us to increase 
the efficiency of our research further, 
by reinforcing our proximity with 
customers and accessing a wider  
pool of worldwide scientific talents.
>  Increase penetration of our value-
creating solutions: The growth of sales 
in our Steel and Foundry Divisions 
outperformed underlying market 
growth in most areas, confirming the 
mounting interest of customers in our 
advanced solutions, enabling them to 
improve their manufacturing efficiency 
whilst at the same time raising the 
quality of their finished products. 
We were particularly pleased with  
our progress in China, where Steel 
Division sales increased by 7% and 
Foundry Division sales increased by 
13% on an underlying basis.
>  Capture growth in developing 
markets: Steel Division sales grew 
faster than the market in the key 
developing regions of China, India 
and the Middle East. However, sales 
growth in Latin America, while positive, 
was slightly below general steel 
market growth. Foundry sales also 
outperformed markets in most 
developing countries, with the 
exception of India where priority was 
given to the management of working 
capital and customer credit risk.
>  Improve cost leadership and margins: 
Our previously announced Lean and 
self-help programme to improve the 
cost competitiveness and efficiency of 
our manufacturing network continued 
to develop in 2017 , extending from 
Flow Control Europe to Flow Control 
NAFT A operations. £16.2m of savings 
were delivered in 2017 , bringing the 
total savings delivered since launching 
the programme to £43.2m. This 
programme is expected to deliver 
£60m of savings at a total cost of 
£75m. A completely new restructuring 
programme focused on the Foundry 
Division in Europe and NAFT A, the 
Advanced Refractories business unit in 
Europe and global corporate functions 
was launched at the end of 2017 , with 
expected recurring savings of £15m by 
2020. In parallel to these restructuring 
programmes, Vesuvius is reinforcing  
its focus on operational excellence  
and continuous improvement in its 
manufacturing operations. 
>  Develop our T echnical Services 
offering: Our T echnical Services 
offering has continued to develop 
in 2017 , not only within our Digital 
Services business unit but also within 
Flow Control, Foundry and Advanced 
Refractories. Late in 2017 , we made a 
strategic investment in Sapotech Oy, 
a Finnish technology company 
developing optical defect detection 
services in the steel continuous casting 
process. This investment will reinforce 
the Flow Control business unit. 
Attracting, Developing and 
Retaining T alent
The success of our strategy ultimately 
relies on the quality and motivation of 
our people. In 2017 , we continued our 
efforts to attract, develop and retain the 
best talents worldwide. This will intensify 
in 2018.
We believe in diversity of talents and 
origins and in the importance of an 
entrepreneurial and decentralised 
culture, with empowered, accountable, 
innovative and results-oriented 
managers, operating close to our 
markets and our customers.
I will strongly support the reinforcement 
of this culture within the Group going 
forward.
Stable Safety Performance 
in 2017
With a lost time injury frequency rate of 
1.63 per million hours in 2017 , our safety 
performance improved slightly over 
2016 (1.72). 
The Group’s injury severity rate improved 
more markedly in 2017 with a severity 
rate of 62.8 days lost per million hours 
worked versus 74.6 days lost per million 
hours worked in 2016, highlighting the 
success of the Group’s efforts to address 
the most dangerous situations in our 
manufacturing plants. 
Our objective is to improve this 
performance further year-on-year.
A new safety management organisation, 
updating responsibility and accountability 
for the management of safety across  
the Group, was established at the end  
of 2017 and will be fully operational in  
the first half of 2018.
Sustainability 
Vesuvius R&D reinforced its efforts in 
2017 to develop products and services 
helping our Steel and Foundry customers 
to reduce their energy consumption and 
carbon footprint through the improved 
service life of our products and reduction 
of waste in their manufacturing processes. 
At the same time, we continued our 
efforts to reduce waste and energy 
consumption in our own manufacturing 
processes.
Outlook 
Our main Steel and Foundry markets 
remain positively oriented at the 
beginning of 2018. However, we expect 
a lower growth rate of steel production 
outside China in 2018 compared to 2017 , 
as the significant decrease in Chinese 
steel exports which occurred in 2017 may 
not repeat in 2018. Our self-help and 
manufacturing optimisation programme 
will continue to develop and expand in 
2018. The temporary raw material and 
product supply headwinds that impacted 
our 2017 results have now been mostly 
mitigated and will substantially unwind 
during the year, subject to any further 
raw material cost increases. We remain 
confident in our ability to further improve 
working capital management and 
generate strong operating cash flow. 
For these reasons, the Board is confident 
that in comparison to 2017 , further strong 
progress will be made in 2018.
