4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT
Our People and Culture
Our strategic objectives specifically identify 
investment in our people as a key driver of 
competitive advantage. We are committed to a 
culture that encourages the training, development, 
wellbeing and participation of every team member.
A great place  
to work
Business objectives are shared with 
team members via quarterly briefings, 
and everyone participates in a quarterly 
“gain share” bonus plan that is based 
on achievement of tangible, clearly 
communicated performance targets.
Training of new team members covers 
job-specific skills, other soft skills and a 
grounding in the 4imprint philosophy. 
Existing team members are regularly 
offered ongoing training opportunities 
in a variety of subjects, some directly 
business-related, and others aimed 
towards personal development, wellness 
initiatives and general education. In 
addition, the pursuit of external educational 
opportunities and professional qualifications 
is encouraged through our popular 
tuition reimbursement programme.
The welfare of our team members is also 
addressed through a competitive benefits 
package, including strong medical, dental 
and pension offerings. We run an employee 
wellness programme, including an on-
site medical clinic in the US operation. 
In addition, many workplace perks are 
available, and our team members organise 
fun events based around themes such 
as Customer Service Week, making the 
Great Places To Work list, and celebrating 
new orders received records.  25

A proactive approach to health and safety 
is an important aspect of the 4imprint 
workplace. Desk-based ergonomics and 
best practice protocols in the operation 
of machinery and material handling at 
our distribution centre are key areas of 
emphasis in promoting a safety culture. A 
Safety Committee meets on a regular basis 
to review any incidents or near misses, 
and to consider future improvements or 
changes in regulatory requirements.
We understand the importance and 
beneficial effect of diversity within our 
team, and we aim to foster a culture that 
recruits, develops and promotes team 
members regardless of background. 
We are committed to the principle of 
equal opportunity in employment, and 
no applicant or employee receives less 
favourable treatment on the grounds of 
nationality, age, gender, sexual orientation, 
religion, race, ethnicity or disability. We 
recognise our responsibility to disabled 
persons and endeavour to assist them to 
make their full contribution at work. Where 
team members become disabled, every 
practical effort is made to allow them to 
continue in their jobs or to allow them 
to retrain for suitable alternative work.
The Group employs over 950 people, 75% 
of whom are female. One third of the 
North American executive team and two 
thirds of the UK senior team are female. 
As at 30 December 2017 the Board had 
no female members, and one of six Board 
members (16%) is a non-UK national.
We are proud of the fact that 2017 was 
the tenth consecutive year that the North 
American operation has been included on 
the prestigious Great Places To Work list 
of the Best Medium Sized Workplaces in 
the USA. The UK-based business maintains 
its Investors in People accreditation. We 
are very proud of these accolades, which 
are emblematic of team members who 
go above and beyond every day to help 
each other, to provide our customers with 
remarkable service and to give back to 
their communities because they know and 
believe that it is the right thing to do.
