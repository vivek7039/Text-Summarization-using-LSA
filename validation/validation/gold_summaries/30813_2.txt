 STRATEGIC REPORT
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 04
We are part of the global Domino’s system, 
the biggest pizza delivery operator in the 
world. We make, sell and deliver pizza and 
a range of other dishes under the Domino’s 
brand from 1,192 stores across six European 
markets. We also have a one-third interest 
in Domino’s Germany.
We hold the exclusive master franchise 
rights in these six markets under long -term 
agreements with Domino’s Pizza 
International Franchising Inc., the 
international arm of Domino’s Pizza Inc 
which is listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange and which owns the 
Domino’s brand across the globe.
In the UK and Republic of Ireland, we are 
the clear number one pizza delivery business. 
Our market share in the UK is 46%. Customers 
love Domino’s because it tastes great, and 
is fast and convenient. We operate stores 
almost entirely through franchisee partners. 
We manufacture dough and act as a scale 
and expert wholesaler of other food and 
non-food supplies to our franchisees. 
We invest in technology to develop the 
ordering platform, making it easy for 
customers and improving franchisees’ 
operations, and we market the brand and 
plan national promotions. 
Our franchisees open and run stores, and 
earn a return from the margin they make 
on making and selling pizza. They employ, 
train and develop their own teams, set prices 
locally and invest in local marketing.
In our other markets, we mainly run the 
stores ourselves. We will look to franchise 
out stores in most markets as we achieve 
greater scale and profitability through 
a larger network. Profitability and returns 
can be further enhanced over time through 
investment in dough manufacturing 
capacity and our supply chain.
