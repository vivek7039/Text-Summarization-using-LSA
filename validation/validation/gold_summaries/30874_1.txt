 12 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CEO LETTER
The driving force behind our success has always been a strong 
commitment to our goals, the dedication of our team and our 
clear long-term vision. The shareholders have entrusted me with 
the leadership of TBC Bank since 1998 and I am extremely proud 
of our accomplishments throughout these years. While TBC Bank 
has mostly grown organically, it has also strengthened its position 
through the acquisitions of Bank Constanta in 2011 and Bank 
Republic in 2016. Today, TBC Bank is the leading bank in Georgia 
and is well positioned to become the best digital financial services 
company in the region
1
 due to our outstanding digital capabilities.
Highlights of 2017
TBC Bank delivered another strong financial performance in 2017, 
posting a record high net underlying profit of GEL 369.2 million, up 
by 35.1% year-on-year. Our strong profitability was underpinned 
by the integration of Bank Republic, which we completed well 
ahead of schedule in the second quarter of the year. We are using 
the merger to drive cost synergies and significantly improve our 
efficiency, delivering an underlying cost to income ratio of 40.5% in 
2017. The integration has also increased our distribution network 
and expanded our customer base, allowing us to cross-sell our 
products to the newly acquired customers. As a result, our 
product per customer ratio in the retail segment increased to 3.9 
in 2017, compared with 3.7 a year earlier.
In 2017, we recorded strong balance sheet growth, increasing our 
loan and deposit portfolios by a respective 16.2% and 21.1% 
year-on-year. As a result, we had market shares of 38.2%
2
 of total 
loans and 39.8%
2
 of deposits in Georgia. In line with our strategy, 
we also increased our net fee and commission income by 39.5% in 
2017, mainly driven by settlement, card and trade finance 
operations. Robust growth, paired with a significant increase in 
net fee and commission income and improved efficiency, offset the 
expected reduction in the net interest margin and led to strong 
profitability. Our underlying return on equity was 21.4% and our 
underlying return on assets was 3.2%. At the same time, we 
continue to maintain sound asset quality and our ratio of non-
performing loans was low at 3.3%.
I am pleased to report that we are on track towards achieving our 
strategic goal of becoming the best digital financial services 
company in the region

. Our customers benefit from our reliable 
and user-friendly internet and mobile banking applications, as 
well as from our wide network of self-service terminals, allowing 
them to conduct most banking transactions remotely. As a result, 
our offloading ratio in retail segment reached 88.3%, while our 
mobile banking penetration ratio increased by 7.2 percentage 
points year-on-year to 31.4%. 
In 2017, we also introduced the first Georgian-speaking chatbot on 
Facebook Messenger, Ti Bot, which gained popularity in a very 
short time and attracted around 124,000 customers and received 
6.5 million messages since launch in March. Ti Bot serves as an 
efficient new sales channel and can also be used to conduct 
simple banking transactions. In December , we also deployed a 
biometric voice recognition system in our call centre to simplify 
customer identification and improve the safety of our customers’ 
personal and account data. We are the first bank in the region
1
 to have 
implemented such a system.
We continue to deliver a superior customer experience by carefully 
analysing feedback received and continuously improving our products 
and service levels. Over the past year , we introduced a fully digital 
onboarding system for our business clients, allowing them to open a 
current account online and perform their transactions without delay. 
The usage of this service is increasing rapidly and, in December , around 
20% of new legal entities registered online. We also launched a loyalty 
programme called Ertguli for our retail customers. Ertguli is a credit

Dear shareholders,
In 2017, TBC Bank celebrated its  
25th anniversary. The Bank was 
established during one of the most 
challenging periods in Georgia’s recent 
history and our story today is an 
outstanding example of how to build a 
sustainable business. 13 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017

card with a pre-approved instalment limit, which also allows customers 
to gather loyalty points and take advantage of special offers and 
discounts. This programme has proven extremely successful, helping  
to increase the use of our credit cards by 79.4% year-on-year . 
On the corporate side, we continue to enhance our product 
offerings. To better serve our customers, we are currently 
developing comprehensive brokerage and corporate advisory 
services, aiming to offer corporate clients a “one-stop shop”. On 
the MSME side, we launched a new financing programme called 
Startuperi for early-stage companies. The programme aims to 
support start-ups not only financially, but also by providing 
non-financial services, including training sessions, master classes 
and special discounts with TBC Bank’s partners.
I am delighted with the first-year results of our newly acquired 
business, TBC Insurance, which grew rapidly in 2017. The number of 
customers increased to around 277,000 from just 3,000 at the time of 
the acquisition in October 2016. Our market share, excluding health 
insurance, reached 13.3%

 as of 31 December 2016, making us the third-largest player on

Macroeconomic overview
2017 was quite a successful year for Georgia’s economy. The country’s 
GDP growth rate almost doubled from the levels seen over the past two 
years, reflecting improvements in the external environment and continued 
domestic reform efforts, which helped to strengthen the confidence of 
consumers and businesses in the country. In 2017, Georgia’s GDP grew by 
around 5.0%
4
, placing the country among the fastest-growing economies 
in CEE, as well as in the CIS region. Improved macroeconomic 
performance across all directions was reflected in the sovereign credit 
rating of the country. In September , 2017 Moody’s upgraded Georgia’s 
credit rating to Ba2 from Ba3 previously with the stable outlook. An 
improved trade and investment relationships, together with strengthened 
banking supervision framework, were named as underlying factors of the 
improved credit rating. Fitch also revised Georgia’s credit rating outlook 
from stable to positive in March 2018 to reflect accelerating growth and 
improved resilience of the economy. 
Georgia continues to benefit from its open trade policies with all major 
economic players in the region. Exports of goods went up by a solid 
29.1% year-on-year in 2017, reflecting the recovery witnessed among 
the country’s major trading partners. Starting from 2018, a free-trade 
agreement with China has entered into force, which should give 
additional impetus to Georgia’s growing exports. 
Tourism remained a source of strength for Georgia’s economy, as the 
number of visitors exceeded 7.5 million in 2017, which represented a 
significant increase on previous years. Tourism revenue surged by 
26.9% year-on-year in 2017 and remained one of the country’s most 
important sources of foreign currency inflows. Georgia’s growing 
image as an attractive year-round tourist destination is expected to 
continue to drive its economy.
Growth in lending and the broader economy were reinforcing each 
other throughout 2017. Banking sector lending to the economy 
increased by 17.8% year-on-year , while loans to legal entities rose by 
10.4% year-on-year . After the subdued growth seen in 2015 and 2016, 
this suggests a revival of investment activity by local companies.  
The continuing trend of growing employment and household 
disposable income contributed to the 25.7% year-on-year growth  
of loans to individuals.
Another positive development in 2017 was the reduction of 
dollarisation of the banking sector , reflecting joint efforts of the public 
and financial sectors. At the year-end, the share of deposits 
denominated in foreign currency was down by 5.9
5
 percentage points 
year-on-year at 65.3%, while the share of loans denominated in 
foreign currency was down by 8.3
5
 percentage points year-on-year at 
57.1%. Lower dollarisation together with a proven track record of 
sound macro and micro risk management have further supported the 
resilience of the banking sector , which traditionally positioned itself 
with high capital, liquidity and profitability ratios, low levels of 
non-performing loans, as well as a prudent regulatory framework. 
Strategic priorities
Our strategic priorities for the coming years include:
  deepening our relationships with customers and delivering 
sustainable growth
  further developing the digital capabilities of our multichannel 
platform
  continuing to improve our customer experience
  increasing operating efficiency and automation
  proactively managing our net interest margin in the context of 
market maturity, competition and regulatory initiatives.
To strengthen our relationships with customers, we actively engage 
with them and offer an innovative range of products and services to 
maintain our leading positions. Currently, our retail customer base is 
more than 2 million people, which is around 75% of Georgia’s adult 
population, providing us with vast opportunities to cross-sell and  
move clients further along our value chain.
In parallel to deepening our relationships with clients, we consistently 
provide a superior customer experience, as measured by the net 
promoter
6 
and customer satisfaction
6
 scores. On these metrics, TBC 
Bank ranks the highest in the Georgian banking industry. Moreover , 
we have one of the top net promoter scores among the leading service 
industries in the country.
As digital channels are vital to our long-term success, our team 
strives to further enhance our digital multichannel capabilities and 
offer reliable solutions to our customers. The number of transactions 
conducted via digital channels continues to grow, especially in mobile 
banking and self-service terminals, indicating customers’ preferred 
digital channels.
I am confident that we are well positioned to implement our strategy.  
For the medium term, we maintain our guidance as follows:
  annual loan book growth of around 15%
  return on equity target of 20% or more
  cost to income ratio of below 40%
  dividend payout ratio of 25-35% of consolidated net profit.
Acknowledgement
In 2017, we made significant progress towards achieving our 
goals. I would like to thank all my colleagues for their dedicated 
hard work and commitment. Over the past 25 years, we as a team 
have worked hard to build a success story. I am confident that we 
will continue to develop and set new standards for the region’s
1
 
banking industry in 2018 and beyond.
