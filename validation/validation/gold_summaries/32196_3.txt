STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW OUTLOOK
The Group remains well positioned in its 
chosen markets and continues to perform 
robustly and deliver strong service levels for 
customers. To date the Group has experienced 
no significant impact from the Brexit vote 
in June 2016, and we believe the Group can 
adequately manage any future uncertainty 
that arises during the Brexit process.
Robust cash generation supports limited 
scale investments in skills and technology 
capabilities to both protect and grow the 
business for the longer term without raising 
the Group’s overall risk profile.
During the coming year the Board expect 
Wincanton to make continued progress.

DIVIDEND 
The Board are pleased to be recommending 
an increased final dividend of 6.1p per Ordinary 
Share for the year ended 31 March 201 7 
(2016: 5.5p). This reflects the Group’s strong 
operating profits and dividend policy outlined 
to shareholders last year when we resumed 
dividend payments. The proposed annual 
dividend is covered 3.0 times by underlying 
earnings. The Board’s progressive dividend 
policy is unchanged.
KEY PRIORITIES AND PROSPECTS
The Group’s overriding priority will be to 
oversee further progress in the delivery of the 
organic growth trading strategy, as set out in 
the Chief Executive’s statement. This requires 
targeted investments in people and processes, 
to extend our capabilities in areas directly 
relevant to customers in our existing contract 
logistics heartland. The Group now has the 
capacity to invest in business development, 
and is actively doing so; but it remains selective 
in its approach, with a risk appetite best 
described as low to moderate.
The Board will also be focused on the 
forthcoming triennial review of the pension 
scheme and in agreeing an appropriate 
future funding plan with the Scheme Trustee. 
The Group still has a sizeable pension deficit, 
and so the pension scheme will remain as a 
significant stakeholder for many years to come.
As already noted, talent management is 
already a key focus, and increasing diversity 
in all its forms will be a priority for the coming 
year, from the warehouse to the boardroom. 
The Board will also ensure that their 
stewardship obligations, not least in the areas 
of operational safety, sustainability and financial 
assurance, remain centre stage and in line with 
best practice.
INTRODUCTION
The year ended 31 March 201 7 represented 
a further year of good progress for Wincanton. 
The focus of the Board and the Executive 
Management Team is on positioning the Group 
to deliver long term organic growth, whilst 
also meeting its obligations to all stakeholders. 
This will be achieved by maintaining and 
deepening strong working partnerships 
with our customers.
The success of an outsourcing business model 
such as ours is driven by providing great 
customer service and value, maintaining high 
levels of contract retention and renewal and by 
securing new contracts to grow the business.
RESULTS
Underlying earnings per share was up by 1 5.9% 
over the prior year to 27 .7p, and has increased 
by 108.3% since the year ended 31 March 201 3. 
Year end net debt at £24.3m (2016: £39.5m) 
was once again reduced, cumulatively a 78.8% 
reduction over the same period. The Group’s 
existing banking facilities were satisfactorily 
extended during the year to provide an 
appropriate level of maturity.
PEOPLE AND THE BOARD
Board membership was unchanged during 
the year. Adrian Colman has continued to 
strengthen the senior management team, 
with a healthy mixture of internal promotions 
and external appointments; broadening 
our talent pool is fundamental to the Group 
delivering on its organic growth strategy 
and meeting customer expectations.
The contribution of the Group’s 1 7 ,500 
employees is once again recognised. 
The Group’s strong reputation for consistent 
operational delivery is above all the product 
of their hard work.
