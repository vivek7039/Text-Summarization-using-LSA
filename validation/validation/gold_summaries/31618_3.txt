Chairman’s  
Statement
ITE	is	entering	a	period	in	the	
transformation	that	requires	dynamic	
change.	The	Group	has	embraced	the	
change	to	date	with	a	renewed	energy	
and	an	appetite	for	success,	which	is	
shared	by	the	Board.
I	am	pleased	to	introduce	to	shareholders	
the	Group’s	Annual	Report	for	the	year	
ended	30	September	2017.	These	results	
demonstrate	a	return	to	growth	in	a	year	of	
substantial	change.
A new vision for ITE
This	was	Mark	Shashoua’s	first	full	year	as	
Chief	Executive	Officer	and	Andrew	Beach	
joined	early	in	the	year	as	Chief	Financial	
Officer.	The	new	executive	team	and	the	
Board	have	undertaken	a	full	strategic	
review	of	the	business	to	identify	the	
optimum	way	forward	for	the	Group.	This	
review	involved	a	number	of	specialist	
advisors	working	together	with	the	senior	
management	team,	covering	every	aspect	
of	the	business	and	the	recommendations	
were	carefully	considered	by	the	Board.
The	result	of	the	review,	unveiled	in	May,	
is	an	evolved	strategy	for	the	Group	to	
generate	organic	growth	focussed	around	
our	market-leading	events.	This	will	involve	
significant	investment	in	event	content	
and	marketing	with	the	intention	to	make	
our	leading	shows	‘must-visit’	events	
in	their	market	sectors.	The	Group	has	
also	adopted	a	new	‘sales-led’	culture	
to drive revenue and has invested in a 
central	best	practice	team	to	ensure	that	
the	Group	is	consistent	in	delivering	a	
high-quality	experience	for	exhibitors	
and	visitors	alike	anywhere	in	the	world.
Our	TAG	programme,	which	will	see	the	
Group	invest	up	to	£20m	over	the	next	
three	years	with	anticipated	strong	return	
on	investment	by	2020,	was	presented	
to	a	number	of	shareholders	in	May	and	
we	were	pleased	with	the	support	it	
received.	You	will	find	more	detail	in	the	
Chief	Executive	Officer’s	Statement.
Performance
Revenue	was	£152.6m	(2016:	£134.4m),	
growth	of	5%	on	a	like-for-like	basis.	This	
is	the	first	year	of	like-for-like	revenue	
growth	for	four	years	and	a	pleasing	
result	from	the	implementation	of	the	first	
initiatives	of	the	Group’s	new	strategy.	
As	expected,	headline	profit	before	tax	
was	lower	at	£31.6m	(2016:	£36.5m)	after	
the	planned	investment	in	the	new	TAG	
programme.	Loss	before	tax	was	£3.2m	
(2016:	loss	of	£4.1m).	Net	debt	has	been	
reduced	by	16%	to	£49.7m	(2016:	£59.1m).	
In	Russia,	and	in	particular	in	Moscow,	
there	are	good	signs	that	the	economy	is	
improving	after	the	geopolitical	issues	of	
recent	years,	yet	we	are	still	experiencing	
challenges	in	many	of	our	other	markets.
Dividends
Full	year	dividend	cover	has	been	
maintained	at	more	than	two	times	
headline	earnings	per	share.	The	full	
year	dividend	per	share	is	proposed	
at	4.0p	(2016:	4.5p).	With	the	current	
lower	levels	of	Group	profit	and	the	
TAG	programme	investment	the	Board	
believes	this	to	be	in	the	long-term	
interests	of	shareholders.	The	final	
dividend	of	2.5p	is	proposed	for	payment	
on	5	February	2018	to	shareholders	
on	the	register	on	5	January	2018.
Board
The	Board	recognise	that	strong	
corporate	governance	is	at	the	heart	of	
a	good	business.	We	remain	focussed	
on	implementing	robust	processes	that	
identify	and	mitigate	risk	and	deliver	best	
practice	in	the	context	of	delivering	on	
our	promises	to	all	of	our	stakeholders.
After	five	years’	tenure,	Marco	Sodi	stepped	
down	from	the	Board	at	the	end	of	the	
financial	year,	having	stepped	down	as	
Company	Chairman	in	July	2017.	Marco	
led	the	business	through	a	difficult	period	
and	provided	invaluable	support	to	the	
management	team	through	the	design	and	
launch	of	ITE’s	new	strategy.	Marco	leaves	
with	the	Board’s	thanks	and	best	wishes.
A	search	is	underway	to	recruit	a	
new	Chairman	to	lead	the	business	
through	the	implementation	of	the	TAG	
programme	and	the	Board	intends	to	
further	strengthen	its	non-executive	
team	during	the	course	of	2018.
Sharon	Baylay	has	taken	over	as	
the	Chairman	of	the	Remuneration	
Committee	for	the	coming	year	to	
allow	Linda	Jensen	to	focus	on	her	role	
as	Senior	Independent	Director.
Our people
ITE	is	a	business	whose	success	is	
dependent	on	the	hard	work	and	loyalty	
of	all	of	its	employees.	It	has	been	a	
challenging	year	as	we	have	reviewed	
our	operations	and	introduced	new	
ways	of	working	in	many	areas	to	
position	the	Group	for	future	success.	
These	initiatives	have	been	fully	and	
positively	embraced	and,	on	behalf	
of	the	Board,	I	would	like	to	take	this	
opportunity	to	thank	all	of	our	1,374	
people	for	their	continued	commitment.
Outlook
We	have	allocated	a	significant	amount	
of	resource	to	the	Group’s	new	strategy	
and	have	recruited	a	substantial,	
knowledgeable	new	team	under	the	
leadership	of	Mark	Shashoua	to	implement	
this.	The	Board	are	pleased	with	the	early	
signs	as	we	seek	to	drive	sustainable	
growth	and	shareholder	value.
The	Group	enters	the	new	financial	
year	with	a	higher	level	of	visibility,	
with	forward	bookings	20%	ahead	
of	last	year	on	a	like-for-like	basis.
With	its	three	year	TAG	programme	well	
underway,	ITE	is	entering	a	period	in	the	
transformation	that	requires	dynamic	
change.	The	Group	has	embraced	the	
change	to	date	with	a	renewed	energy	and	
an	appetite	for	success,	which	is	shared	by	
the	Board.	With	the	potential	for	further	
improvement	in	both	the	geopolitical	and	
economic	markets	in	which	we	operate,	
the	Board	is	confident	for	the	future.

Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s  
Statement
ITE’s	performance	in	2017	reflects	a return	
to	revenue	growth	following implementation	
of	early	TAG	initiatives.
Revenues	for	the	year	were	£152.6m	
(2016:	£134.4m),	up	5%	on	a	like-for-like	
basis.	This	is	the	first	year	of	like-for-like	
revenue	growth	since	2013,	driven	by	
Russia,	and	in	particular	Moscow,	where	
many	of	our	Core	events	are	located.	
The	reported	loss	before	tax	of	£3.2m	
(2016:	loss	of	£4.1m),	was	after	including	
one-off	restructuring	costs	of	£5.0m	(2016:	
£nil),	£4.6m	of	which	were	incurred	as	part	
of	the	TAG	programme,	and	impairment	
charges	of	£14.3m	(2016:	£26.5m).
Headline	profit	before	tax	was	£31.6m	
(2016:	£36.5m)	and	headline	diluted	
EPS	was	8.1p	(2016:	10.7p).	Both	of	
these	measures	reflect	event	timing	
differences	and	are	after	incurring	costs	
associated	with	the	TAG	programme	
within	headline	results,	in	relation	to	the	
delivery	of	the	Group’s	new	strategy.
After	I	joined	the	business	on	1	September	
2016,	we	set	three	main	priorities	for	the	
year	ended	30	September	2017.	These	
were	to:
1.	 Complete	a	comprehensive	review	of	
the	business	in	order	to	develop	our	
future	strategy	and	vision;
2.	 Improve	our	trading	position;	and
3.	 Set	an	operating	rhythm	to	increase	the	
operational	rigour	and	breed	a	culture	
of	success.
I	am	pleased	to	report	clear	progress	has	
been	made	against	each	of	these	priorities	
and	a	firm	commitment	has	been	made	to	
invest	in	our	people,	systems	and	products	
so	we	can	deliver	better	experiences	for	
our	customers	and	accelerate	growth.
Strategic Review and  
evolution of our strategy
At	the	start	of	the	year	we	undertook	
a	thorough	and	detailed	review	of	
the	business,	which	included	reviews	
by	product,	geography,	structures,	
systems,	sales,	marketing,	IT	and	
finance.	The	outputs	of	this	review,	
unveiled	in	May	2017	resulted	in	an	
Headline	profit	before	tax
£31.6m
Mark Shashoua 
Chief	Executive	Officer
TAG	one-off	investment
£20.0m
evolved	strategy	and	the	introduction	
of	a	three	year	TAG	programme.
At	our	strategy	update	in	May,	our	new	
vision	for	the	Group	was	announced:	
“To create the world’s leading portfolio 
of content-driven, must-attend events 
delivering an outstanding experience 
and ROI for our customers”.
By	putting	exhibitors	and	visitors	at	the	
heart	of	everything	we	do,	we	plan	to	drive	
sustainable	growth	for	our	shareholders.	
ITE	strives	to	run	the	best	shows	and	
offer	the	best	service	to	its	customers	
throughout	the	world,	regardless	of	
location.	The	Group’s	focus	on	a	product-
led	strategy	will	see	ITE	focus	on	events	
that	are	market	leading	or	have	a	clear	path	
to	become	number	one	in	their	sector.
To	deliver	our	vision,	TAG	is	being	
implemented	across	the	Group	and	
comprises	three	pillars:
–	 Create	a	scalable	platform	to	generate	
real	organic	growth;
–	 Actively	managing	our	portfolio;	and
–	 Make	selective	product-led	acquisitions.
As	part	of	our	TAG	programme	we	are	
investing	up	to	£20m	across	the	next	
three	years,	which,	underpinned	by	a	
performance-led	culture,	will	accelerate	
organic	revenue	growth	as	follows:
Create a scalable platform
Transformational	levers	and	TAG	
investment	will	be	spread	across	five	
areas to:
–	 Create best practice functions 
and teams
• Deliver	best-in-class	processes	
implemented	globally	across	the	
Group,	greater	efficiency	via	
standardised	processes,	a	more	
structured	and	accountable	
leadership,	and	a	globally	consistent	
‘ITE	way’	driving	efficiency	and	
greater	attendee	experience.
–	 Invest in show operations
• Enhance	customer	retention	and	
exhibitor	reach,	obtain	enriched	data	
insights	and	improve	operational	
efficiency.
–	 Build capability and talent
• Attract	and	retain	talent,	develop	
internal	capabilities,	and	establish	
the	right	capabilities	to	drive	
business	and	adapt	to	market	
changes.
–	 Drive a performance culture
• Create	a	values-driven	organisation	
that	encourages	high	performance	
and	rewards	success	and	talent,	
building	a	winning	team	with	an	
aspirational	culture.
–	 Build and maintain fit for purpose 
IT infrastructure and systems
• Create	a	global	IT	function	and	
infrastructure	that	can	support	the	
requirements	of	a	flexible,	mobile	
and	highly	effective	workforce	that	
operates	globally,	but	delivers	locally,	
and	supports	and	enables	a	‘One	ITE	
way	of	working’.
As	part	of	creating	a	scalable	platform,	as	
a	result	of	the	above,	the	Group	will	move	
decisively	from	being	a	decentralised,	
geographically	structured	business	to	
one	that	is	more	centralised	and	product-
led	with	strong	regional	platforms.	The	
evolution	of	customer	expectations	
implies	that	every	local	market	now	
expects	events	of	a	truly	international	
quality.	Global	multinationals	are	starting	
to	choose	one	events	company	that	
will	cater	for	them	globally,	rather	than	
a	variety	in	different	markets	and	the	
trend	is	towards	a	one-stop	shop	that	
is	able	to	deliver	a	consistently	high	
standard	of	service	everywhere.
Early	progress	with	implementing	the	
strategy	has	been	good;	the	framework	
for	the	TAG	programme	has	been	
finalised,	based	around	the	five	areas	
noted	above.	The	governance	for	the	
programme	has	been	set,	the	TAG	
programme	team	created	and	heads	
of	best	practice	have	been	recruited.
Having	focussed	our	early	efforts	on	
sales	and	marketing	initiatives	in	
order	to	drive	trading	performance,	I	
am	pleased	to	report	we	have	started	
to	see	tangible	evidence	of	progress.
