Group sales were £6,125m, 5% lower
than 2001, largely as a consequence of
divestments, principally in the Regional and
Industrial businesses, and adverse exchange
rate movements.
Trading profit for the International
Businesses (National Starch, Quest,
Performance Specialties and Paints) was
£543m, 5% below 2001, but only 1% lower
on a comparable basis with Paints 9% up
and National Starch 5% up offset by the
performance of Quest, 23% lower, and
Performance Specialties, 24% lower.
Group profit before tax, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items was
£400m, essentially in line with 2001.
Return on average net assets The
International Businesses achieved a 20%
return, (2001 20%) despite the lower trading
profit.
Dividends declared at 7.5p per Ordinary
Share.
Net debt reduced by £1,250m to £1,667m
at the end of 2002, mainly as a result of
proceeds from the Rights Issue of £807m and
business divestments. In addition, the Group
generated a net operating cash inflow of
£99m, £164m better than for 2001.
Trading profit, profit before tax and earnings per share
figures are quoted before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items throughout this Report, including pages
7 to 9, unless otherwise stated.

by the International Businesses. Reconciliations between
“comparable” and “as reported” performance measures
for the International Businesses are provided on pages
28 and 31. All references to the Group’s performance
are “as reported”.
