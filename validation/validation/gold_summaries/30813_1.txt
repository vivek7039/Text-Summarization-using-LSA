 STRATEGIC REPORT
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 08
Overview
It has been a year of excellent operational 
and strategic development for Domino’s 
Pizza Group, with continued organic growth 
in established markets enhanced by an 
increasing presence in a number of newer 
markets. We are seeking to build a portfolio 
of assets at different stages of maturity 
which together provide long-term, 
sustainable growth. 
Our strategy across all of our markets remains 
simple and clear. We aim to be the number 
one pizza company in each neighbourhood, 
through a commitment to offering the best 
product and service to our customers.
UK
The UK market moderated this year, after 
three years of very strong like-for-like 
growth. Consumers were more cautious 
and value conscious, and incomes were 
squeezed as wage inflation lagged broader 
cost inflation. The competitive environment 
continued to evolve, with delivery service 
companies continuing to invest heavily in 
growing scale.
Despite these dynamics, Domino’s achieved 
another good performance. On a 52 week 
basis system sales were up 8.6%, driven by 
growth from order volume of 6.5% and 
1.9% on average order value. Like for like 
sales growth (excluding effect of splitting 
territories) was 4.8%. We continued to take 
share in the pizza delivery market, thanks 
to our scale, our physical expansion, the 
strength of our brand and the quality of our 
product; and we held our share of the 
overall delivered food market, which 
continues to grow strongly.
New store growth was the key driver of our 
performance in the year. After 81 new openings 
in 2016, our franchise partners opened a 
further 95 in 2017. With 1,045 stores now 
across the UK, we are confident of 
reaching our target of 1,600.
Around two-thirds of new store openings 
are coming in existing territories, where 
franchisees are realising the significant 
customer service and financial benefits 
of splitting territories. 
The inherent profitability of the system and 
the strength of the brand are also enabling 
franchisees to make attractive returns in 
increasingly small standalone catchment 
areas. For example, in market towns of no 
more than 10,000 households, a Domino’s 
store is likely to be the only branded quick 
service restaurant or food delivery 
business, leading to a disproportionate 
market share.

While the sales growth drivers of our business 
can be simplified down to new openings 
and like-for-like growth from existing 
stores, these factors and the overall 
profitability of the system are in turn 
underpinned by the operational areas of 
focus discussed below.
Customer value and experience
We operate in a highly competitive 
marketplace. Technology and new business 
models have given customers more choice 
than ever, both in terms of the range of 
cuisines available and the number of ways 
they can order. At the same time, they have 
become much more value conscious over 
the last year as incomes are squeezed by 
inflation. This became most evident to us 
early in 2017, when our Winter Survival deal 
performed poorly compared to previous years 
as a result of a less compelling value proposition.
We believe pizza to be the best value 
delivered food, but it is not always perceived 
that way by customers. This is partly a result 
of the promotional nature of pizza delivery 
pricing: published menu prices appear high 
relative to some alternatives, but in fact in 
2017, 87% of our orders in the UK were on 
some kind of promotion, and the average 
discount was 38%. As a result, many 
customers are still left with the false 
perception of high menu prices.
During the second half of the year, we 
worked with our franchisee partners to 
address customer value more directly. 
This included a decision to invest up to 
£4 million in absorbing food cost inflation 
on behalf of franchisees to ensure 
customers were getting the best value 
possible. In September we launched a 
national campaign focusing on the price of 
an individual pizza with our ‘Dine for £9.99’ 
offer, which was our most successful 
campaign of the year in terms of sales. 
Additionally, we have sought to push our 
value message harder in our collection 
business. In the Spring, we launched our 
‘Walk in Wins’ campaign, a ‘Buy One Get 
One Free’ offer on collected pizza which 
has been running permanently since then.
“ With 1,045 stores now across 
the UK, we are very confident 
of reaching our target of 1,600.”
Our 1,000th store 
was opened 
in Overton, 
Hampshire.
We have also made it even easier for 
customers to see that they are getting the 
best deal available to them. The app and 
website landing pages now show all the 
current promotions, and our Deal Wizard 
automatically updates a customer’s basket 
for the best deal for their selections. 
On the customer experience side, we 
continue to make the best use of our 
greatest competitive advantage: the 
Domino’s control of the end-to-end 
customer journey. This is a crucial 
differentiator from the delivery service 
companies or aggregators. Domino’s 
sources ingredients, runs the ordering 
platform, cooks your pizza fresh in a local 
store, and brings it to your door courtesy 
of Domino’s delivery drivers who are 
directly employed by franchisees. 
We made further significant enhancements 
to our digital platform during the year. 
We have added voice ordering through 
Amazon Alexa and integrated Apple Pay 
as a payment option. Our major web 
releases throughout the year focused on 
continuous improvement to the customer 
journey, reducing page load times and 
adding functionality such as saved card 
details and previous baskets. For the full 
year, 75.2% of sales by value were ordered 
online, up from 71.8% in 2016.
Throughout Domino’s, the customer 
service benefits of the “Golden Mile” are 
a strong driver for growth: the closer we 
are to customers, the quicker the pizza gets 
delivered and the higher volume of collection 
business we achieve. Quicker delivery 
significantly enhances the customer 
experience and leads to a higher level of 
repeat ordering. Our key ‘Delivered On 
Time’ metric measures what proportion of 
orders reach customers within 30 minutes. 
During the year, our % DOT fell very 
slightly, from 82.9% of orders to 81.8%, 
but still remains a key differentiator. 
Increased density of the store network 
also raises our brand visibility, with each 
store effectively acting as a billboard.
Our collection business performed strongly 
over the year, underpinned by new stores 
and territory splitting. Total collection sales 
were up 12.6% and represented 21.4% of 
system sales. For new and immature stores, 
collection represented 31% of sales. 
Finally on customer experience, we 
introduced new food options to keep the 
menu up to date and cater for changing 
tastes. These include our Chipotle Pulled 
Pork pizza and a Chilli Cheese stuffed crust, 
both of which have been very popular with 
customers. We also extended our desserts 
range to include the Lotta-Chocca pizza and 
Cinni Dippers.

Brand
The Domino’s brand is a highly significant 
asset for the Group and our franchisees. 
For many of our customers, ‘Domino’s’ 
has become synonymous with ‘pizza’ in a 
way that has no equivalent across other 
types of delivered food. In our detailed 
annual consumer survey, our unprompted 
awareness was 54%, compared to 31% 
for our closest pizza delivery competitor 
and 19% for the closest aggregator 
(source: Parthenon Study, 2017).
The growth in the overall system creates a 
virtuous circle. Franchisees contribute 4% 
of sales to the National Advertising Fund, 
which we then invest in brand marketing on 
their behalf, to drive both brand values and 
specific promotions. These investments 
drive greater sales, underpinning returns 
on new store openings for franchisees. 
New stores increase the visibility of the 
brand, improve customer service (as 
discussed above) and grow the top line, 
swelling the brand budget further.
Business model page 14
In September 2017 we launched our new 
brand campaign, “The Official Food of 
Everything”, which clearly positions Domino’s 
as an established category leader – a timely 
evolution from our previous challenger brand 
positioning. The impact of the campaign in 
brand recall has been very strong, with 
recognition of the positioning running at 
three times the level of previous campaigns, 
and unprompted awareness at 84% – our 
highest ever. We continued to support our 
above the line presence with the sponsorship 
of TV shows such as The Voice and 
Hollyoaks, targeting key audiences and 
family home entertainment events.
While the annual survey demonstrated 
continued strength in key areas such as 
great tasting food and convenience, we 
witnessed an emerging weakness in value 
for money perception, with prices being 
cited as the single biggest barrier to 
increased repeat ordering. This, combined 
with the weaker trading witnessed in the 
early months of 2017, informed our value 
for money communications strategy 
outlined above.
Franchisee profitability and alignment
Our franchisees remain some of the best 
entrepreneurs and operators in the Domino’s 
system worldwide. Our interests are aligned: 
we all benefit from increased scale, through 
the growing value of the brand, greater 
supply chain efficiency and the shared 
investment in new innovations to improve 
the customer experience continuously.
The 2014–2016 period was an extraordinary 
one for the system and for franchisees, with 
very strong order growth (supported by 
rapid online adoption and the secular trend 
towards in-home entertainment) combined 
with sustained deflation in food costs. 
Between 2013 and 2016, average per 
store EBITDA for franchisees increased 
very strongly.
2017 saw a return to more normalised sales 
growth rates, combined with cost pressures 
on both labour and food. Nonetheless, the 
combination of like-for-like sales growth 
with the procurement benefits of our scale 
saw franchisee EBITDA per store (excluding 
the impact of splitting territories) maintained 
year-on-year at just over £150,000. This 
figure remains significantly ahead of the 
average from 2011-2013, and provides a 
typical payback on a new store opening 
of around three years.
We want to help our franchisees maintain 
this rate of payback. As a result, not only 
have we provided support on food cost 
inflation as described above – to ensure 
that customers continue to get great value 
for money – but we have also developed a 
number of innovations to improve operating 
efficiency and drive down costs. Most recently 
In September 
2017 we launched 
our “The Official 
Food of Everything” 
campaign.
we have started to introduce GPS across 
the store portfolio. This allows franchisees 
to track delivery drivers more effectively 
and leads to significant improvements in 
labour productivity. It is now operational in 
471 stores, and we expect to complete 
roll-out by Q3 of 2018.
A further development of alignment with 
franchisees in 2017 came with our acquisition 
of a 75% interest in the largest franchisee in 
the London area, with 25 stores. Domino’s 
is significantly under-represented in London, 
a market which we believe accounts for 25% 
of delivered food in the UK but only 14% of 
our sales. We aim to grow this business 
more aggressively under direct ownership.
This is the first time for many years that the 
Group has taken control of a portfolio of 
stores in the UK, but it is common practice 
across the Domino’s system worldwide to 
have a small proportion of stores directly 
operated. Store ownership aligns us more 
closely with franchisees by making us 
operators as well as master franchise 
holders, and gives our management valuable 
operational experience. It also allows us to 
test pricing, menus and technology in a live 
environment and use the results to support 
and influence the franchisee network further. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

Supply chain and infrastructure
Our supply chain in the UK is one of the 
most efficient in the Domino’s network. 
It is also a major source of differentiation 
versus our competitors, whether in the 
restaurant or aggregator space. The margin 
generated within the Domino’s system from 
being vertically integrated from dough 
manufacture, through value-added food 
and non-food distribution, to our own 
ordering platform and franchisees’ stores, 
allows both the Group and our franchisees 
to make excellent returns.
The rapid growth over the last few years 
and our future plans have led to our single 
biggest ever investment this year, with the 
development of a new supply chain centre 
in Warrington. The total cash investment 
in 2017 was £26.7m and on completion the 
programme will have cost £37m–£39m.
The facility is due to enter service in spring 
2018, and will combine with our existing 
supply chain centres to give us capacity 
to serve at least the 1,600 stores we are 
targeting, at projected levels of store sales. 
Its scale and level of automation will deliver 
efficiencies of up to 10% cost per tray of 
dough in real terms by 2021. As indicated at 
the time of our interim results, there will be 
a short term impact of an additional £3m in 
operating costs and depreciation in 2018 as 
the plant ramps production.
“  W e e x p e c t I n t e r na t i ona l 
to represent an increasing 
proportion of the Group’s 
profits and cash flow over 
the longer term.”
Online sales 
were up 28.8% 
year-on-year and 
now represent 57% 
of total sales.
ROI
Growth in the Republic of Ireland accelerated 
in 2017, buoyed by a recovering economy 
and by our own actions, particularly in digital. 
Local currency system sales on a 52 week 
basis were up 11.3%, with like-for-like 
growth of 10.8%. On a 52 week reported 
basis, system sales were up 19.9% to 
£60.1m, reflecting the weakness 
of sterling year-on-year.
Online sales were up 28.8% 
year-on-year in local 
currency, and now 
represent 56.9% of total 
sales. We opened our first 
new stores in ROI for six 
years, taking the total up 
by two to 49, with plans for 
further new stores in 2018. 
We also plan to invest in extending 
our supply chain capacity to allow us to 
serve 75 stores in ROI as well as our stores 
in Northern Ireland.
International
Our controlled operations now comprise 
four markets: Switzerland, Iceland, Norway 
and Sweden and our associate in Germany. 
In each of these markets we see a clear 
opportunity to build strongly profitable 
businesses with local scale, adapted to their 
markets but leveraging our proven 
expertise in supply chain, digital and 
franchisee management. 
Consolidated system sales for the 
year from our International operations 
were £78.1m, with an underlying EBIT 
contribution of £0.8m.
We expect International to represent an 
increasing proportion of the Group’s profits 
and cash flow over the longer term, both 
from the development of our existing 
markets and entry into selected new 
markets with similar dynamics.
In Switzerland, we made significant 
progress during the year. Total system 
sales on a 52 week basis were up 17.1% in 
local currency, and up 15.7% like-for-like. 
There were two significant drivers of 
this acceleration: revised menu pricing 
and increased online participation.

International continued
In H1, we lowered menu prices and 
introduced a delivery charge. As a result, 
we saw our average ticket price fall 13.2% 
but achieved order volume growth over 
the year of 34.9%. Online sales grew 56.6% 
and now account for 55.4% of total sales. 
We opened a new store in Q4 and have 
plans for several further openings in 2018, 
at a lower cost per store than our previous 
operating model in Switzerland.
Iceland
Since we took majority ownership of Iceland 
in May 2017 total system sales were £28.9m. 
Sales growth was 10.8% in local currency 
on a pro forma basis. Domino’s Iceland is 
the leading quick service restaurant in the 
market and achieves weekly unit sales of 
over £37,000, comfortably the highest of 
any Domino’s operation worldwide. During 
the year we opened a further two stores, 
taking the total to 23.
In December 2017 we announced our 
intention to acquire a further 44.3% stake 
in Domino’s Iceland, taking our ownership 
to 95.3%. The transaction was completed 
in January 2018. 
Norway
Our expansion in Norway accelerated 
significantly in 2017 with the acquisition 
of Dolly Dimple’s, the number three pizza 
operator in the market, with 39 stores. At 
the year end we had converted 9 stores to 
the Domino’s brand, giving a total portfolio 
of 27 Domino’s stores. Conversions are 
performing well, with weekly sales up 
around 50% on average compared to 
their previous runrate.
Pro forma system sales growth from the 
Domino’s branded chain was 94.6%, with 
like-for-like growth of 13.5%. We expect to 
complete another 10 conversions in 2018, 
as well as opening further greenfield sites. 
7 Domino’s stores in the South of Oslo and 
Southern regions are franchised, and we will 
seek to identify further franchisee partners.
Sweden
We opened our first stores in Sweden in 
late 2016 and by the 2017 year end, we had 
6 stores. Weekly sales of around £18,000 
are an encouraging sign of the popularity 
of our pizza and indicate that we can grow 
a profitable business in Sweden. Further 
store openings are in the pipeline for 2018.
Germany
In Germany, where we are a one-third 
associate partner in a joint venture 
with Domino’s Pizza Enterprises, the 
Australian-listed master franchisee, 
progress continues to be good. The 
integration of Joey’s, acquired in 2016, 
is complete, and in October 2017 we 
announced the acquisition of Hallo Pizza, 
another leading independent chain. 
Once the Hallo Pizza stores have been 
converted, we will operate a portfolio 
of over 300 stores in Germany, with 
significant opportunity for long-term 
growth in Europe’s largest economy.

People
The Domino’s culture remains central to 
our success, and this is exemplified every 
day in the individual and combined efforts 
of both the Domino’s team and our franchisee 
community. Dedication, pride in the brand 
“  Our excellent unit economics 
and our control of the 
customer experience are 
important differentiators.”
and a shared vision underpins everything 
we do. I’d like to extend my thanks and 
appreciation to all of them for their 
continued commitment.
Outlook
I remain confident in the outlook for the 
Group, and the year has started in line with 
our expectations. It is not an accident that 
pizza is the most successful delivered food 
in the world. It is quick to make fresh, travels 
well while retaining its heat, enjoys a high 
margin thanks to its mix of ingredients, 
and has a sufficient ticket size to absorb 
the cost of delivery. 
We will continue to grow in the UK, getting 
closer to new communities through a target 
of 65-75 new store openings in 2018, and 
providing ongoing enhancements to service 
through our investments in technology and 
our supply chain. We expect capex for 2018 
to be around £30m. We will continue to face 
competitive threats from branded pizza 
delivery businesses and delivery service 
businesses, but our excellent unit economics 
and our control of the end-to-end 
customer experience are important 
and sustainable differentiators.
Internationally, we are still in the early stages 
of our development but all of our controlled 
markets benefit from strong sales per store 
already – a very encouraging sign for the 
future. We will focus on developing per 
store profitability, adding on supply chain 
margin when the scale justifies it, and 
building the brand to facilitate successful 
digital growth and regional roll-out. We will 
also review any opportunities to enter 
additional markets in Northern Europe. 
Finally, we will continue to balance the 
long-term needs of the business with 
returns of excess capital to shareholders, 
and plan to invest up to £50m in 2018 in 
our share buyback programme.
