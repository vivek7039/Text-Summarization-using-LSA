Chairman’s Statement  
Peter Hill, CBE
Strong results created through 
excellence in ventilation. 
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present our Annual Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 31 July 2017, a year in which we have continued to 
make strong progress in building a more valuable Volution Group. 
This was despite the vote for the UK to leave the European Union 
and the resulting devaluation of Sterling against both the US Dollar 
and the Euro. While we expect some uncertainty ahead as the 
UK negotiates the terms of Brexit, we remain confident in the 
long‑ term prospects for the Group based on our clear strategy 
of building our brand portfolio while diversifying in markets and 
geographies. Our businesses performed well with excellent trading 
performance during the year with 19.8% growth in revenue, an 
increase in adjusted operating profit of 9.6% to £35.6 million and 
strong cash generation, making this the sixth consecutive year 
the business has recorded revenue and underlying operating 
profit growth.
During the year the Group made further progress with its strategy 
of making selective value‑ adding and strategically important 
acquisitions in our ventilation segment, acquiring Breathing 
Buildings in the UK and VoltAir System in Sweden. This strategic 
pillar, acquiring selective value‑ adding acquisitions, together with 
organic growth, has supported the achievement of another year 
of strong performance and growth. You can find further details 
on the Group’s three strategic pillars on pages 18 to 19.
Summary
 > A further set of strong results in line with 
our expectations 
 > Completed two value‑ adding acquisitions, 
enhancing our strategic positioning
 > Strong cash generation which supports our 
continuing strategy to grow through acquisition
 > Full year dividend increased by 9.2% 
 > Product innovation receiving industry accolades 
and underpinning our growth 
It was a historic year in which Vent‑ Axia, 
the UK’s leading ventilation company, 
celebrated 80 years of innovation since 
the brand was founded by Joe Akester in 
1936. Since then Volution has gone from 
strength to strength, by building on the 
heritage of our brands.

Performance and results
Another strong set of results reflects the growth achieved, both 
organically and through acquisitions, with the Group’s revenue 
increasing by 19.8% to £185.1 million. Adjusted operating profit 
was £35.6 million, representing 19.3% of revenue and a £3.1 million 
improvement compared to the prior year. Reported profit before 
tax declined by 2.5% to £17.9 million (2016: £18.4 million), driven 
by the increased amortisation of acquired intangible assets and 
the movement in the fair value of financial instruments.
The basic and diluted earnings per share for the year was 
7.0 pence (2016: 7.8 pence). Our adjusted earnings per share 
was 13.6 pence, representing a 7.9% increase over the adjusted 
earnings per share for the prior year (2016: 12.6 pence). 
Revenue from the ventilation segment grew by 21.6% (16.3% 
at constant currency) to £163.1 million. Strong organic growth 
in the Nordics and the UK Residential New Build sector was 
partly offset by the continued challenging performance in the 
UK Residential Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) 
sector. Revenue from the OEM (Torin‑ Sifan) segment grew by 
7.7% (2.8% at constant currency) to £22.0 million. The Group’s 
inorganic revenue growth of 12.5% benefited from the full year 
effect of the prior year acquisitions and the acquisitions of 
Breathing Buildings in the UK and VoltAir System in Sweden 
during the year. 
Cash generation was strong with adjusted operating cash flow 
of £35.9 million (2016: £31.1 million). Net debt at the year end 
of £37.0 million (2016: £36.1 million) was only £0.9 million higher 
than last year, despite having completed two acquisitions 
incurring a net cash outflow of £18.1 million.
Acquisitions
The acquisition of Breathing Buildings widens Volution’s capability 
with a market leader in natural and hybrid ventilation for commercial 
buildings, in particular focusing on new construction in the UK 
education sector. VoltAir System is a strong player in the residential 
and commercial new build ventilation markets in Sweden in the 
growing market for energy‑ efficient air handling units.
Both acquisitions were funded from the Group’s existing cash 
and banking facilities. As a Board, we evaluate each acquisition 
opportunity very carefully to ensure that it meets our strategic 
objectives as well as the financial hurdles set for investment. More 
details can be found in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review and 
in the Financial Review. We very much welcome the employees 
of all these companies to the Volution Group.
Dividends
We aim to deliver shareholder value through organic and inorganic 
growth and a sustainable dividend policy. We paid an interim 
dividend of 1.35 pence per share in May 2017. On the basis of 
our strong results, the Board has recommended a final dividend 
of 2.80 pence per share, giving a total dividend for the financial 
year of 4.15 pence per share (2016: 3.80 pence per share), an 
increase of 9.2% on the previous year. As a consequence of this 
recommendation, the resulting adjusted earnings dividend cover 
for the year is 3.3x (2016: 3.3x). Subject to approval by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 13 December 2017, the final 
dividend will be paid on 18 December 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at 24 November 2017.
Innovation
It was a historic year in which our subsidiary Vent‑ Axia, the UK’s 
leading ventilation company, celebrated 80 years of innovation 
since the brand was founded by Joe Akester in 1936 when he 
invented the world’ s first electrically operated window fan. Vent‑ Axia 
has been a leading British manufacturer ever since and the brand 
has become a household name featuring annually in the UK 
Superbrands league table and holding the prestigious Royal Warrant. 
This ethos of innovation has continued and we were delighted 
when Vent‑ Axia celebrated winning three separate awards during 
the year, two for the Kinetic Advance mechanical ventilation with 
heat recovery unit and one for the Revive fan. More information 
on these awards can be found in the Chief Executive Officer’ s Review 
on pages 9 to 11. This spirit of innovation and continuous 
improvement is applied across our brand portfolio.
During the year we commenced a project to rationalise part of 
our UK manufacturing footprint into one location. The facilities in 
Reading and Slough are being relocated to a newly built facility at 
Suttons Business Park in Reading, with the move to be complete 
by the middle of 2018. This new facility is state of the art and is 
aligned with our ethos of innovation and “Excellence in Ventilation”. 
UK leaving the European Union
Since the UK’s vote to leave the European Union, the Group 
has continued to monitor business performance closely. Although 
it is still too early to assess the implications for our business and 
operations over the longer term, we do not believe that there will be 
any material near‑ term impact on demand for our products. However, 
the weakness of Sterling against foreign currencies has persisted 
and has led to increasing cost pressures in the UK, primarily from the 
direct import of components whose costs are tied to the US Dollar. 
Our exposure to US Dollar‑ denominated purchases from Asia is 
substantially hedged for the balance of the 2018 financial year 
and we continue to mitigate the effect on costs by implementing 
price increases and product cost reductions.
Following the completion of ten acquisitions since September 2012, 
Volution is now a more diversified and flexible business. With our 
proven track record of performing well in challenging trading 
environments and our strong balance sheet, we are confident 
about delivering on our strategy over time. Volution Group plc

Governance
The Group continues to be committed to high levels of corporate 
governance, in line with its status as a company with a premium 
listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. Details 
of our processes and approach, including those relating to the 
role and effectiveness of the Board, and compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, are set out in the Governance 
Report on pages 50 to 57.
Board
As part of the Board’s ongoing remit to set the right tone from the 
top and build its understanding of Volution’s business, the Board 
visited the Hälleforsnäs facility in Sweden, following its visit to our 
German operations in 2016. It is the Board’s intention to continue 
to visit other facilities across the Group to build its understanding 
of each business unit. 
As previously reported in August 2016, we welcomed Claire Tiney 
to the Board as an independent Non‑ Executive Director. Claire 
has over 20 years of board‑ level experience encompassing executive 
and non‑ executive roles in blue‑ chip retailing, property development 
and the services sectors, across the UK and Continental Europe. 
The Board has welcomed Claire’s contribution since her 
appointment reflecting her board experience. 
In June 2017 we celebrated three years as a listed company. At 
that time the four Non‑ Executive Directors who were appointed 
at listing (Tony Reading, Paul Hollingworth, Adrian Barden and 
me) were re‑ appointed as Non‑ Executive Directors following the 
end of the three‑ year term of office. Adrian Barden was initially 
appointed to the former holding company of the Group, Windmill 
T opco Limited, on 3 February 2012 and provided important continuity 
on the Board whilst the business moved from private‑ equity 
ownership to a listed company. With the need to progressively 
refresh the Board and given that Adrian will have served just under 
six years on the current and pre‑ IPO Board at the time of the 
2017 Annual General Meeting, he will be retiring at the AGM and 
will not be seeking re‑ election from shareholders. I would like to 
extend my thanks to Adrian for his contributions during his tenure. 
To ensure an orderly succession plan, the Nomination Committee 
has recently initiated a search for a new Non‑ Executive Director 
and an announcement will be made in due course. Further information 
can be found in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 58 
to 59. 
People
It has been another year of growth for the Group with the addition 
and integration of two new businesses and the Volution team has 
performed well against this continued backdrop of change. Our 
strategy would not succeed were it not for the positive attitude 
and sheer hard work of our people in adapting to the constant 
change across the Group. Volution has a clear idea of where it is 
going and how to get there and we also have excellent leadership 
in our management teams. 
Our second internal Management Development Programme 
concluded during the year. We place considerable value on this 
programme which, as well as helping to develop the effectiveness 
and scope of our people, has significantly assisted in the integration 
of new acquisitions as our high potential managers are made to 
feel part of a wider group network and assist in the formation of 
the overall Group culture. Given its success, a third programme is 
due to commence later in 2017.
In accordance with the relevant regulations, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy will be put to a shareholder vote at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and a number of changes 
have been proposed to reflect current best practice. The 
proposed changes are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 67 to 84. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our employees 
for their hard work, commitment and contribution towards the 
Group’s performance, making this another successful year.
