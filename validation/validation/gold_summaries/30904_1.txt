 The second phase has delivered a 50,000 sq ft 
five-storey office building with a 4,000 sq ft 
Sainsbury’s Local store on the ground floor, a 
115 bed hotel and a ‘gateway’ pedestrianised 
public space opposite the station entrance.

Fit Out
Working in partnership with LOM architecture and design, a 1980s 
cash-handling facility was transformed into a state-of-the-art, co-working 
campus for tech start-up companies.
The building was stripped back to its original concrete frame and the upper 
floors divided into open plan accommodation, dedicated workspaces and 
cellular office space. The double-height basement provides a networking hub 
and event space with tiered seating, teaching facilities, media pods, meeting 
rooms and a bar. The original bank vault was retained and redesigned as a 
themed games room.
During the strip out, more than 1,200 tonnes of materials were removed, 
of which 97.5% was recycled.

Our strong results are evidence of the significant operational 
progress being made across the Group. They are testament 
to the quality and commitment of our people.
The Group has delivered another 
strong year of growth in 2017, providing 
an encouraging platform for future 
progress across all divisions. Our result was 
driven by another excellent performance 
from Fit Out, with revenue growth of 
16% to £735m and significant margin 
improvement to 5.3% (2016: 4.3%), 
delivering operating profit of £39.1m, 
up 42% (2016: £27.5m). Construction 
& Infrastructure has made further 
operational progress with an improved 
operating margin of 1.5%, up from 0.7%, 
and operating profit up to £20.4m 
(2016: £8.9m). Progress in Property 
Services was impacted by restructuring 
costs in the year with the division 
making a loss of £1.3m, however this 
now leaves the division better placed 
to benefit from its secured workload 
in future years.
In regeneration, Partnership Housing 
increased its operating profit 5% to 
£14.1m (2016: £13.4m), although its 
performance was affected by lower 
mixed-tenure open market sales in the 
year and by cost escalation on a single 
design and build housing contract. 
Urban Regeneration reported operating 
profit of £10.0m (2016: £13.4m) which, as 
expected, was lower than last year but in 
line with its schedule of development 
completions. Investments made good 
progress with developing its portfolio 
of property partnerships, delivering 
a small profit of £0.5m in the year.
Our positive cash generation and 
increase in average net cash in the year 
has further strengthened our balance 
sheet and provides us with the flexibility 
to invest in our regeneration activities 
while allowing us to continue being 
highly selective with bidding in our 
construction activities.
Performance against strategy
We achieved our Group strategic 
objectives as outlined on pages 16 to 17. 
We have continued to target industry 
sectors within the UK where there is 
growth, and we have the capability to 
service areas of particularly high demand 
such as housing, infrastructure and urban 
regeneration, all of which are underpinned 
by firm government commitment.
Each of our divisions has succeeded 
in pursuing its business strategy. 
Construction & Infrastructure has 
continued to focus on operational 
delivery, contract selectivity and quality 
of earnings in its core sectors, securing 
appointments to a number of new public 
sector frameworks. Fit Out has continued 
to win work in its targeted sectors and 
secured places on two large public sector 
frameworks. Through Property Services 
we are currently delivering planned and 
response maintenance services to over 
25 social housing providers.
Partnership Housing made progress in 
developing partnerships with housing 
associations and local authorities, 
supported by its comprehensive 
research into development opportunities 
on underutilised public land. A highlight 
for the division was being formally 
awarded its largest ever project 
as a single phase, for the Defence 
Infrastructure Organisation. Urban 
Regeneration entered into an agreement 
with the Greater London Authority to 
develop a 2.2 hectare site in Canning 
Town through its English Cities Fund 
(ECf) joint venture and started on site 
with the fourth phase of its regeneration 
scheme in Warrington.
Investments’ successful regeneration 
programmes in Slough and Bournemouth 
are growing, and it has entered a new 
joint venture in the extra care sector. 
In addition, the division is continuing to 
provide collaborative opportunities for 
other parts of the Group through its 
schemes. More detail on the performance 
of our divisions can be found on pages 
28 to 47.
Our commitment to being a responsible 
business is integral to achieving our 
strategic objectives, as our activities 
affect a wide range of stakeholders. 
I am pleased to report that this year 
we achieved FTSE4Good Index Status. 
We have continued to reduce our 
greenhouse gas emissions and expect 
this trend to continue, but to avoid any 
complacency, we have set up a Carbon 
and Energy Action Group to drive 
best practice across the divisions.
