 Building sustainable growth
Commercial highlights
• Sustainable growth in profitability in line with expectations:
 – Organic growth, contribution from acquisitions and 
foreign currency translation gains, more than offset  
the expected softening of Nitrile latex margins.
• Europe and North America (ENA) momentum 
underpinned by volume and margin improvement:
 – Underlying operating profit at £117.1m increased 
25.5% (2016: £93.3m) due to volume and margin  
growth, the acquisition of Oxo Belgium (‘Speciality 
Additives’) and foreign currency translation gains.
 – IFRS operating profit at £77.5m increased 2.8% 
(2016: £75.4m). 
• Asia and Rest of the World (ARW) in line with 
expectations in challenging market environment:
 – Underlying operating profit lower by 27.9% at £35.1m 
(2016: £48.7m) mainly driven by expected lower unit 
margin in Nitrile latex.
 – The demand for Nitrile latex continues to grow at 8-10% 
pa, with market demand exceeding 1,000ktes in 2017
 – IFRS operating profit down 61.6% to £31.2m 
(2016: £81.3m) principally reflecting significant 
income from land sales in 2016.
• M&A activity:
 – 2016 PAC (Dispersions) acquisition fully integrated and in line 
to deliver expected $12m run rate synergy savings at the end 
of 2018, and a likely further $2m saving by end of 2019.
 – Acquisition and integration of Speciality Additives, a 
market leading performance additives business serving 
the decorative and industrial coatings industries, for an 
enterprise value of €78m in March 2017.
 – Bolt-on acquisition of the BASF Austrian SBR business 
and assets in Pischelsdorf, Austria (‘BASF Pischelsdorf’). 
The €29.3m acquisition enhances Synthomer’s SBR 
business and production network for paper/packaging 
applications and completed on 31 January 2018.
• Record capital investment growth programme:
 – Capital investment increased to £60.3m (2016: £45.6m)  
in the year in line with guidance.
 – Significant capacity expansion projects underway at Pasir 
Gudang (Malaysia), Worms (Germany) and Roebuck (US)
adding 90ktes of Nitrile latex, and 36ktes and 9ktes of 
Dispersions capacity respectively.
• R&D driving innovation: 
 – Launch of patented SyNovus
®
, the next generation 
Nitrile latex.
 – Products launched in last five years represented 20% 
of sales in line with our target (2016: 20%).
• Another year of strong cash generation:
 – Cash generated from operations grew 3.6% to £162.6m 
(2016: £157.0m).
• Earnings per share: 
 – Underlying earnings per share for the year rose 8.5% 
to 30.7p (2016: 28.3p) and on an IFRS basis earnings 
per share declined 32.9% to 21.8p (2016: 32.5p).
• Dividend: 
 – Full year dividend increased by 8.0% to 12.2p per share 
in line with dividend policy (2016: 11.3p per share).

Underlying Statement 
The Group’s management uses Underlying performance to plan for, control and assess the performance of the Group. Underlying performance differs from the statutory 
IFRS performance as it excludes the effect of Special Items, which are detailed in note 3. The Board’s view is that Underlying performance provides additional clarity for 
the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. Where appropriate, IFRS performance inclusive of Special Items is also described. 
References to ‘unit margin’ and ‘margin’ are used in the commentary on Underlying performance. Unit margin (or margin) is calculated on selling price less variable raw 
material and logistics costs. Further explanations can be found in notes 4, 5 and 6.
