Our acquisition timeline
Having developed a multi-brand platform, the Group is looking to grow further through the acquisition of additional 
significant franchise networks or companies offering specialist property-related services from which our franchisees 
can benefit. The latter underpinned the rationale of acquiring Brook during 2017.
Historically a lettings franchise, Belvoir 
now offers both sales and lettings 
services and has nationwide coverage.
