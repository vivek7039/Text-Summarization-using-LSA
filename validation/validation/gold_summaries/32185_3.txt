Chairman’s Statement
We believe that excellent progress 
has been made across each of the 
five key pillars that underpin the 
strategy.
Overview
Since setting out our Moving Up A Gear strategy 18 
months ago, excellent progress has been made across 
each of the five key pillars that underpin the strategy. 
This has been reflected in robust sales growth, an 
expanded knowledge of our customer preferences, 
further improvements in service levels, many new and 
unique product introductions, progress in building a 
fit for purpose infrastructure and strong growth in our 
value-added service offerings. T o this end, and on behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank our Management team 
and our 10,000 plus colleagues for their hard work and 
commitment in driving the business forward and for their 
passion to help our customers on their journeys.
Performance
We achieved solid sales growth from our Motoring 
activities, in both Retail and Autocentres, and strong 
growth in Cycling where we continued to register 
market share gains and can uniquely offer customers 
the full range: from children’s balance bikes to high 
end performance road bikes. Whilst the depreciation 
in Sterling following the EU referendum and other cost 
headwinds, such as the introduction of the National Living 
Wage, clearly impacted earnings, the underlying business 
performance was positive and cash flow was robust.
We applied our capital allocation policy consistently: 
firstly, by further investment in our colleagues and our 
infrastructure; secondly, with an increased ordinary 
dividend; thirdly, with two complementary acquisitions – 
100% of T redz and Wheelies in May 2016 and a minority 
stake in TyresOnTheDrive.com in January 2017; and, 
thereafter, by paying a special dividend of 10 pence per 
share in February 2017. Progress was thus made towards 
our debt target of 1 times EBITDA. In line with our policy 
of paying an increasing ordinary dividend, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 11.68 pence per share, 
payable in August 2017 which would result in a total full-year 
ordinary dividend of 17.51 pence per share, up 3.0% over 
the previous year.
Investment in our colleagues continues to reap benefits 
and I am pleased that Halfords was, for the 4th year in a 
row, awarded an improved place in the list of T op 30 Best 
Big Companies T o Work For. This was also confirmed by 
an increased internally measured engagement score, 
improved customer ratings and lower colleague turnover. 
We are also proud of the recognition we have achieved, 
and the awards won, for our community partnerships, 
including many individual local projects, and for our work 
in prisons to help provide employment to prisoners on 
release. Our colleagues in Retail have progressed strongly 
through the “Gears” training programme, gaining increased 
pay awards and career development opportunities in 
return. We also continued to invest in our leadership 
development programmes and apprenticeship schemes.
Outlook
The year ahead brings challenges in the form of further 
cost headwinds, particularly from a full year’s impact 
in the fall in Sterling, and uncertainty around consumer 
spending, but we approach these from a position of 
strength. We hold leading positions in fragmented 
markets, have detailed plans and initiatives to mitigate 
cost headwinds and our growing service and services 
propositions set us apart as a specialist retailer.
It was disappointing that, earlier this month, our CEO Jill 
McDonald tendered her resignation to take up a senior 
role at M&S at the end of October. We are grateful for the 
positive contribution she has made across the business 
and she will leave Halfords with a clear direction to 
drive future growth. The Moving Up A Gear strategy is 
well underway and is delivering significant momentum 
across the organisation. Crucially, we have a talented 
group of engaged colleagues who remain focused on 
implementing our strategy and providing customers with 
the very best customer service; in doing so we will drive 
sustainable long-term growth.
