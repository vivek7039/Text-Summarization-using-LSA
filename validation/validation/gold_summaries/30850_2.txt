driver of the 19% increase in net 
management fees to £392.4m. This 
enabled the continued investment in  
our business. Our efficient platform and 
operating model helped turn revenue 
growth into underlying earnings per 
share of 34.2p, up 16%. Other financial 
highlights include:
l l Basic earnings per share  
up 14% to 34.5p
l l Profit before tax up 13%

Strategic report
AT A GLANCE
Jupiter manages mutual funds, segregated mandates and investment trusts 
on behalf of individuals and institutions. We are a leader in the UK mutual 
fund market and have a growing presence in our chosen European and 
Asian locations.
INVESTMENT OUTPERFORMANCE 
IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT 
WE DO
We aim to deliver value for money to 
our clients through active fund 
management that delivers long‑term 
investment outperformance, after all fees. 
Investment outperformance helps us to 
grow our assets under management 
(AUM), by ensuring we keep existing 
clients and attract new ones. In turn, 
growing our AUM increases our revenues 
and profits, allowing us to invest for 
continued growth as well as rewarding 
employees and adding value for 
shareholders through ordinary and 
special dividends and capital 
appreciation.
OUR PEOPLE AND CULTURE 
ARE KEY
We believe that talented individuals who 
are free to pursue their own investment 
styles can make the most difference for 
clients. With no ‘house view’ to constrain 
them, our fund managers actively seek 
the best investment opportunities through 
fundamental analysis, with a focus on 
good stewardship.
Our fund managers are organised into 
strategy teams, ensuring that they can 
share ideas and information, while 
retaining accountability as individuals for 
their funds’ performance. As we grow, 
this approach helps to give us a more 
diversified business by asset class, 
geography and investment style.  
At 31 December 2017, we employed  
74 investment professionals in London, 
supported by 449 other employees. This 
included 34 people located in Europe 
and Asia providing in‑ country support 
for our international business growth. 
A DIVERSIFIED AND 
RESILIENT BUSINESS MODEL
In recent years, we have followed a 
successful strategy of diversifying Jupiter 
by geography, client type and product 
while maintaining and investing in our 
efficient operating platform. This has 
given us a more resilient business and 
provides a broader range of growth 
opportunities for the years ahead.
OUR VALUES
Our primary responsibility is to our 
clients who entrust their savings to  
our management. We aim to protect 
and grow their assets and provide  
an excellent service.
Every employee can make a difference 
to Jupiter. We value individual talent 
and independent thought and seek  
to give freedom to employees to 
deliver. We do this within a team 
framework where respect, high 
standards and innovation are key  
to our high‑ performance culture.
We aim to make a positive 
contribution to society as managers 
of other people’s money. We seek  
to do so by increasing the value of 
our clients’ savings, in the way we  
run money and by behaving in an 
ethical manner.
We believe that if we live by our 
values, Jupiter will be a profitable and 
sustainable company which provides 
fair returns to clients, employees and 
shareholders.
