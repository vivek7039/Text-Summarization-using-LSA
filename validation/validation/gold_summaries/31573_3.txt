Chairman’s statement
The Board remains confident in the prospects for the Group
Strong strategic 
progress over the year
I am pleased to announce, on behalf of the Board of Safestore, another 
strong set of results for the year ended 31 October 2017. 
There has been strong strategic progress over the year. Space Maker, 
acquired in July 2016, is fully integrated into the Group and the six 
new stores opened over the last sixteen months are all performing 
at least in line with their business plans. The acquisition of Alligator, 
completed on 1 November 2017, will be integrated during the first half 
of the current financial year and we have a pipeline of four new sites, 
adding 226,000 sq ft of capacity, opening over the next 18 months. 
Management’s focus remains on the existing store portfolio and filling 
the 1.7m sq ft of available capacity (including Alligator), building on 
the operational improvements made over the previous four years. 
The refinancing of our bank debt and US private placement notes in 
May 2017 has improved further the balance sheet flexibility and capacity 
to continue to take advantage of carefully selected development and 
acquisition opportunities. I remain confident that the business is well 
positioned for growth and to deliver additional value for shareholders.
During the year, our Remuneration Committee has spent a significant 
amount of time engaging with our shareholders around our new 
remuneration policy. Like the Remuneration Committee, I strongly 
believe that the new remuneration structure, which is designed 
to break away from the conventional model and drive exceptional 
corporate performance from our talented management team over 
the next five years, is in the best interests of all stakeholders. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank all the shareholders who have 
supported our proposals, as well as all of those who have engaged 
with us and put considerable time and effort into analysing and 
providing feedback on our proposals.
Financial results
Revenue for the year was £129.9 million, 12.6% ahead of last year 
(FY2016: £115.4 million) and was up 10.0% on a constant currency 
basis. Like-for-like revenue was up 3.3% in constant currency. 
This result was driven by a solid performance in the UK, which 
grew like-for-like revenue by 3.1%, combined with another strong 
performance by Une Pièce en Plus, our Parisian business, which 
grew like-for-like revenue by 4.0%. In addition, the July 2016 acquisition 
of Space Maker contributed to the revenue growth.
Underlying EBITDA increased by 13.6% to £72.9 million (FY2016: 
£64.2 million) and 10.7% on a constant currency basis. Underlying EBITDA 
after rental costs increased by 13.0% to £62.6 million (FY2016: £55.4 million).
The refinancing of our bank debt and US private placement notes 
in May 2017 was the principal driver of a reduction in the year in 
the underlying finance charge of £0.7 million or 6.9% to £9.4 million 
(FY2016: £10.1 million). Over the last four years we have reduced 
our finance charges by 49% or £9.0 million.
As a result of the above factors, cash tax adjusted earnings per share 
grew by 17.7% to 23.3 pence (FY2016: 19.8 pence). Cash tax adjusted 
EPS has grown by 12.2 pence or 110% over the last four years.
Statutory basic earnings per share decreased to 37.4 pence 
(FY2016: 42.0 pence), the increase in cash tax adjusted earnings per 
share being offset by a reduction in the gain on investment properties 
and an increase in exceptional costs and exceptional finance charges.
Capital structure
The Group’s balance sheet remains robust with a Group LTV
7
 ratio 
of 36% and an interest cover ratio of 6.7x. This represents a level 
of gearing we consider appropriate for the business to enable the 
Group to increase returns on equity, maintain financial flexibility 
and to achieve our medium term strategic objectives.
Dividend
Reflecting the Group’s strong trading performance, the Board 
is pleased to recommend a 21.7% increase in the final dividend to 
9.8 pence per share (FY2016: 8.05 pence per share), resulting in an 
increase of 20.2% in the total dividend to 14.0 pence per share for 
the year (FY2016: 11.65 pence per share). The total dividend for the 
year is covered 1.66 times by cash tax earnings (1.70 times in 2016). 
The Group’s dividend has increased by 143% in the last four years. 
Shareholders will be asked to approve the dividend at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2018 and, if approved, the final 
dividend will be payable on 6 April 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 9 March 2018.
The Board remains confident in the prospects for the Group and 
will continue its progressive dividend policy in 2018 and beyond. 
In the medium term it is anticipated that the Group’s dividend will 
grow at least in line with Adjusted Diluted EPRA Earnings per Share
12
. 
People
In another year of progress, our people continue to be the key to the 
success of the business. I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
all my colleagues throughout the business for their hard work and 
dedication this year.
