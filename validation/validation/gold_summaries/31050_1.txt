DELIVERING RESULTS 
A BRIGHT FUTURE
Chief Executive’s review
2017 was a milestone year for us, 
with commencement of construction, 
incremental supply agreements 
signed (bringing the total to 4.4 million 
tonnes per annum), a move to the 
Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange and inclusion in the 
FTSE 250 among the highlights. 
Our numerous successes along the 
development journey drive us to 
approach this next phase of 
development with the same ownership, 
belief and urgency which are some of 
the key values which define who we 
are. For those who have supported 
us over the years I hope the 
commencement of construction 
provides further validation of our 
commitment to succeed. 
Safety
Safety is paramount to the success of 
our business. Our culture places 
safety at the forefront of everything 
we do and we are continuously 
engaged with our contractors and 
consultants to ensure they adopt our 
safety culture and company values. 
Two recordable incidents have 
occurred during the first year of 
construction and we are constantly 
working to improve our processes and 
find safer ways of working in order to 
ensure that we all return home to our 
families at the end of each day. 
For those who have supported 
us over the years I hope the 
commencement of construction 
provides further validation of our 
commitment to succeed.

4 May 2017: formal commencement of 
construction
Expanding global research and 
development programme
Our strategy
The Company has a clear and robust 
strategy and is focused on executing 
this strategy successfully. 
Our strategy is to:
• build a world-class, long-life, 
low-cost production facility;
• develop an industry leading product;
• penetrate existing markets and 
drive long-term value; and
• execute a financing plan that 
delivers returns for shareholders.
Along our journey we have made 
strategic decisions within this 
framework, whether it be switching to 
a more efficient, low impact transport 
system or even the nature of our 
product. Optimisation through 
evolution will always be at the heart 
of our strategic decision-making 
process. Through this process, 
we believe that the Sirius value 
proposition continues to grow 
and be further enhanced. 
Build a world-class, long-life, 
low-cost production facility
It has always been our intention to 
construct a production facility which 
enables us to maximise the potential 
of our unique polyhalite resource. The 
scale, thickness and quality of the 
deposit means highly efficient, bulk 
mining methods can be employed to 
maximise output over hundreds of 
years and these considerations are at 
the forefront of our approach to mine 
design and construction. We believe the 
asset we are constructing will be among 
the most cost-competitive multi-nutrient 
fertilizer producers globally.
For those of you who have driven past 
the Woodsmith Mine site over the 
past 12 months you will be impressed 
with its transformation. Formal 
commencement of construction 
started officially on 4 May 2017 and 
the work completed over the course 
of the year is the first step in executing 
on this part of our strategy. 
Develop an industry-leading 
product
POLY4 is a natural, low chloride, 
multi-nutrient fertilizer, the likes of 
which has never been widely 
available in the major growing 
regions of the world. Our ever-
expanding global agronomy 
programme provides partners and 
potential customers with an 
independently validated dataset 
which demonstrates the efficacy of 
POLY4 on a wide range of different 
crops in varying geographic and 
climatic conditions. Leading industry 
participants and potential customers 
are excited by the prospects of POLY4 
and are enthusiastic about introducing 
it into their product portfolios. 
 
During 2017 we articulated the four 
cornerstones of POLY4: Effectiveness, 
Efficiency, Flexibility and Sustainability. 
The cornerstones describe POLY4’s 
unique value proposition and are 
proving to be an effective marketing 
tool. I encourage you to visit 
the POLY4.com website to learn more 
about the product.
Penetrate existing markets and drive 
long-term value
We have a three-step approach to 
our marketing strategy:
• Substitution – utilising POLY4 as a 
substitute for other existing fertilizers 
which include one or more of the 
same primary nutrients contained 
in polyhalite. This disruptive 
approach will ensure POLY4 is 
widely available in all markets. 
• Market growth – today there is an 
unmet demand for lower chloride 
potassium sources, and making 
POLY4 widely available at a 
commercial price point will unlock 
new sources of demand and 
opportunities to adopt greener 
and more sustainable agricultural 
practices. 
• Performance – our successful 
extensive crop trial programme 
consistently demonstrates strong 
performance from POLY4 and we 
believe this performance will 
underpin premium pricing for the 
product over the long term.

Chief Executive’s review 
continued
The Company continues to work 
hard at building its customer base 
and I was pleased to welcome Wilmar 
International as a customer during 
2017. They are the leading agri-
business in South East Asia and will be 
a strong partner for the Company. 
Execute a financing plan that 
delivers returns for shareholders
The Company has taken a rigorous, 
phased approach to executing the 
financing plan. At each stage of 
development, appropriate capital 
has been raised to deliver the next 
development milestone. 2016 saw 
the first successful completion of the 
stage 1 financing, which provided 
the equity and equity-linked capital 
components of the construction 
financing plan. 
In 2017 the Company obtained a 
Premium Listing on the Main Market 
and was included in the FTSE 250. 
Behind the scenes, work was 
underway to prepare for the 
execution of the Company’s stage 2 
financing in late 2018. It is intended 
that this financing will be 100% debt in 
nature and ultimately provide all of 
the capital required to complete the 
construction component of the 
Company’s strategy. 
The year ahead
2017 has been a year of meaningful 
progress on the ground in North 
Yorkshire and in the global fertilizer 
markets. 2018 will be another year of 
significant progress on all fronts, with 
that progress ultimately culminating 
in the successful completion of the 
stage 2 financing. 
There is a lot more work to do in 
order to successfully execute on the 
Company’s strategy but I am confident 
our team has the necessary expertise to 
deliver. The culture we have throughout 
the organisation is reflected in our 
corporate values. These values embody 
why we have succeeded in achieving 
a number of challenging milestones 
but also how we will continue to deliver 
on what we set out to achieve. It is our 
shared belief in achieving our goals 
and our unwavering drive to succeed 
that will see us successfully through 
the next phase of development. 
Thank you all for your ongoing support.
