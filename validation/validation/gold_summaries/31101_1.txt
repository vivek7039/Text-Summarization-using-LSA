 Chief Executive’s review
A year of good operational progress
Capco has made good operational progress across its two prime 
central London estates. Covent Garden, which now accounts for  
72 per cent of the Group’s portfolio by value, has had another strong 
year creating value and positive rental performance. We continue  
to implement our strategy by focusing on asset management, 
investment and managing the estate creatively. Covent Garden is a 
world-class destination in the heart of central London offering a 
vibrant mix of British heritage, independent and global brands and 
continues to evolve to meet consumer demand. Investments made 
in recent years including on Henrietta Street, Floral Street, King 
Street and the Royal Opera House Arcade have positioned the estate 
well. This has resulted in strong demand from occupiers and as new 
concepts open, we are capturing the reversionary income potential 
of the portfolio. 
At Earls Court, good operational progress has been made. ECPL,  
the investment vehicle with TfL, which represents our principal 
investment in Earls Court, successfully completed the final phase  
of the complex demolition of the former Exhibition Centres, which 
prepares the land for development. At Lillie Square, Phase 1 handover 
has substantially completed. By the end of 2017 the residents of 182 
new homes had been welcomed to the scheme. A pop-up high street 
for Earls Court was successfully launched on Lillie Road. 
Whilst the West End and Covent Garden have continued to thrive, 
economic and political uncertainty has continued to impact the 
residential market in London, resulting in a further valuation 
decline in our investments at Earls Court. The growth in Covent 
Garden was offset by a decline in the value at Earls Court. As a 
result, EPRA net asset value fell by 1.7 per cent over the year to  
334 pence.
While the environment for large-scale residential development has 
become more difficult, the Earls Court Masterplan has an existing 
planning consent in place and remains one of the largest 
Opportunity Areas in central London, capable of delivering new 
homes, jobs and investment. Earls Court has the ability to evolve 
with the needs of London and its potential will be realised over 
time. As a long-term investor in London, Capco will continue to 
seek to engage positively with our partners and all stakeholders  
in order to evolve the Masterplan, which has the flexibility to be 
brought forward through the introduction of third-party capital 
and selective development.
Over the year, the Group successfully realised value from the sale  
of its Venues business, crystallising £230 million of net proceeds 
which will be recycled into Capco’s central London estates. 
Capco’s prudent approach to its balance sheet continues. We 
maintain a strong financial position with low leverage, high 
liquidity and modest capital commitments. The business is 
well-positioned to support its future activities, navigate market 
uncertainties, while taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. 
Capco remains disciplined in its investment approach, with a 
weighting towards Covent Garden as we continue to expand our 
ownership on the estate.
CLEAR AND FOCUSED 
STRATEGY TO DRIVE  
LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION
Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 10  Valuations
The total property value of the Group declined 0.9 per cent 
(like-for-like) in the year to 31 December 2017 to £3.5 billion. The 
valuation of Covent Garden has risen by 4.3 per cent (like-for-like) to 
£2.5 billion, driven by ERV growth of 4.6 per cent achieved over the 
year. The equivalent yield remains broadly unchanged, reflecting 
the valuer’s current view of the strength of demand for prime 
central London real estate. 
Capco’s investment in Earls Court Properties declined by 11.8 per 
cent (like-for-like) to £1.0 billion at 31 December 2017. A number  
of adjustments have been made to the component parts of the 
valuation of our interest in ECPL. The valuer’s more conservative 
view on gross development value and the cost of delivery, together 
with recent transactional evidence in the land market, have resulted 
in a net decline of 14.4 per cent (like-for-like) for ECPL in the second 
half of the year. Similarly the valuation of our other interests at Earls 
Court has declined reflecting changes in valuation assumptions. 
The Group has a 63 per cent controlling interest in ECPL, the 
investment vehicle with TfL, which owns the land formerly 
occupied by the Earls Court Exhibition Centres (“EC1 & EC2”). As a 
result, it is fully consolidated in the financial statements and TfL’s 
interest is represented as a non-controlling interest. See the 
Financial Review on page 38 for further information.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Covent Garden – a world-class retail and dining destination 
Covent Garden is continuing to build on its success as a world-class 
retail and dining destination. Our creative asset management 
strategy has driven positive leasing momentum with good demand 
for all uses across the estate. We continue to strengthen the core 
categories of luxury gifting and accessories, cosmetics and 
differentiated dining concepts. 
The estate is valued at £2.5 billion as at 31 December 2017, a 
like-for-like increase of 4.3 per cent. During the year, 21 new retail 
and restaurant brands were signed to the estate, the most in any 
year to date. As a result of positive demand across all uses, 90 new 
lettings and renewals were agreed, securing £14.6 million of rental 
income at 10.4 per cent above December 2016 ERV. Net rental 
income has increased significantly, by 17.8 per cent in absolute 
terms or 11.3 per cent like-for-like for the year. The ERV of the estate 
is £105 million, up 4.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis, with positive 
progress being made towards the ERV target of £125 million by 
December 2020. 
The range of dining concepts on the estate continues to expand, 
with the introduction of a number of high quality and differentiated 
concepts including The Oystermen, Avobar and The Henrietta. The 
latest additions further enhance Covent Garden’s attractiveness as 
one of London’s most desirable dining destinations. 
Covent Garden’s retail offering has gone from strength to strength. 
The Market Building has introduced Daniel Wellington, Tom Ford 
and Deciem. The repositioning of the Royal Opera House Arcade 
continues with the addition of leading travel brand Tumi which is 
set to join British heritage brands N. Peal and Tom Davies which 
opened stores during the year. Lettings to Kent & Curwen and The 
Shop at Bluebird represent an excellent start to the repositioning  
of Floral Street. 
Development of Floral Court nears completion. Anchored by 
Petersham Nurseries, the courtyard is expected to open in the coming 
months and will improve the circulation of pedestrian flows on the 
northern part of the estate. The residential component, comprising 
45 new apartments, is expected to complete by summer 2018. 
We have continued to invest in the estate through acquisitions 
which offer value creation opportunities. £99 million was invested 
in acquisitions during the year, most notably consolidating our 
presence on Floral Street. 
Earls Court Properties – large-scale strategic opportunity in 
central London 
During the year, ECPL successfully completed the final phase of the 
complex demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres 
in preparation for future development.
Handover of Phase 1 of Lillie Square nears completion with £98 
million (Capco share) of proceeds received by the end of the year. 
Cumulative proceeds of £125 million (Capco share) are expected  
to have been received on Phase 1 over the coming months. 
Negotiations are at an advanced stage for the main construction 
contract for Phase 2. 50 per cent of the 186 apartments in the phase 
have now been reserved or exchanged. 34 of these transacted during 
2017, seven of which occurred during the second half of the year. 
Sales prices achieved in Phase 2 are at a modest premium to 
comparable units in Phase 1. 
The consented Earls Court Masterplan is a strategic development 
for London and is identified as a Greater London Authority (“GLA”) 
Opportunity Area. It is referenced in the draft London Plan issued 
in December 2017 as ‘ready to grow’. The political environment has 
made discussions on enhancing the Masterplan more difficult, 
however Capco will continue to seek to engage positively with the 
GLA, our partners at Transport for London and other stakeholders 
to evolve the Masterplan over time. This includes discussions with 
London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham (“LBHF”) regarding 
the possibility of the Council taking the lead on future plans for the 
West Kensington and Gibbs Green Estates (“The Estates”).

20 February 2018
Capco is in discussions with MOPAC (the Mayor’s Office for 
Policing and Crime) regarding its ongoing occupational 
requirements at the Empress State Building which may include  
a lease extension or sale of the building. There is no certainty  
that any transaction will be agreed. 
Innova Investment
In 2015, Capco acquired a 50 per cent interest in Innova Investment 
(formerly Solum Developments), a joint venture with Network Rail, 
which is exploring potential opportunities for future 
redevelopments at significant railway station sites across London.
Sale of Venues 
On 7 April 2017, Capco completed the sale of Venues to a 
consortium of German institutional investors for £296 million. 
Profit on disposal of Venues was £2 million. Having extracted 
significant value from the venue since acquisition, Capco took the 
decision to exit this non-core asset realising value for shareholders 
through sale. Cash proceeds were used initially to repay bank debt 
and will be deployed in Capco’s prime central London estates  
over time.
Outlook
Covent Garden is a world-class retail and dining destination in  
the heart of London, offering a differentiated mix of global, British 
heritage and independent brands addressing the needs of the 
consumer. Through creative asset management and by attracting 
excellent retail brands and dining concepts, the reversionary 
income potential of the portfolio will be captured. Capco will 
continue to invest in strategic acquisitions, interventions and in 
enhancing the customer environment. Following a year of positive 
leasing activity, 2018 will be another active year for openings across 
the estate, which are expected to further strengthen Covent 
Garden’s reputation as a leading global destination. The estate 
remains well-placed for continued success and ERV progression 
towards the target of £125 million by December 2020. 
The consented Earls Court Masterplan represents one of the most 
important mixed-use developments in London. The GLA’s draft 
London Plan issued in December 2017 references Earls Court as 
‘ready to grow’ demonstrating the site’s potential to deliver more 
housing and optimise this important London scheme. Whilst the 
economic and political environment presents challenges to the 
London residential market and large scale developments, Capco 
will continue to seek to positively engage with all of its partners 
and stakeholders to evolve the Masterplan. The consented 
Masterplan has the flexibility to be brought forward through the 
introduction of third-party capital and selective development. 
Capco has a clear strategy to deliver long-term value creation  
for our shareholders from our two prime central London estates. 
Backed by a strong balance sheet with low leverage, high liquidity 
and modest capital commitments, Capco is well-positioned to 
support its future activities, navigate market uncertainties and  
take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
