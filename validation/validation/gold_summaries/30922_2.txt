WE SELL 
Stock 84 new 
branding and 
relaunch
Stock 84 is one of the flagship brands of 
the Stock Spirits portfolio with over 130 
years of heritage, founded by visionary 
Lionello Stock, who first produced his 
own Italian brandy in 1884. 
Throughout its history, Stock 84 has been available in 24 countries across 
the world, with variations to its range, packaging and branding over time. 
This redesign brings a renewed consistency to the product range globally, 
whilst giving it a fresher and more modern look. 
Stock Spirits conducted exhaustive market research to ensure the redesign 
was in line with consumers’ high expectations for Stock 84, working with 
leading Italian design agencies on the redesign project. The new bottle 
stays faithful to the traditional Stock 84 silhouette, but with a modern 
twist that adds a premium feel.
