Introduction and Summary  
of the Group
The key aim for our business is to create a 
cash-generative, growing pan-European animal 
health company and in July 2017 Animalcare 
Group plc completed the acquisition of Ecuphar 
NV (“Ecuphar”), an acquisition that constituted 
a reverse takeover. This brought together two 
businesses to create an enlarged group focused 
on the development and marketing of innovative 
products providing significant benefits to  
animal health. 
The business now has a considerably enlarged 
footprint and sales network with direct sales 
teams in 7 European countries and an export 
network that covers over 38 countries across 
Europe, Asia, Australasia, Africa and South 
America through 86 different distribution 
partners. Within our product portfolio we have 50 
licensed drugs, eight vaccines and over 100 care 
and nutraceutical products employing around 100 
sales representatives and 28 agents marketing 
these products to our global customer base.
Shareholders in Animalcare are now invested in 
a substantially increased pan-European animal 
health platform with the following characteristics 
and strategic objectives:
 { Delivering double digit profit growth: 
We expect to deliver further incremental 
organic growth across revenues, EBITDA and 
underlying net earnings with the potential to 
achieve double-digit profit growth.
 { Cash generative: Continuing focus on cash 
generation allows us to maintain dividend 
payments as well as invest in our business to 
drive future growth.
 { Strong organic growth potential: We now 
have an increased geographic footprint for 
cross-selling; we expect to extract further 
synergies taking effect in 2018 but with a 
more meaningful impact in 2019, and we 
expect to deliver further growth through our 
new product development pipeline. 
 { Acquisitive growth potential: Our strong 
balance sheet and scale also opens 
opportunities for value-accretive acquisitions 
which would allow us to target direct sales in 
other geographical territories.
Business Review
The Group is focused on the development and 
sale of veterinary products in the companion 
animal, production animal and equine 
markets and is divided into two segments: 
Pharmaceuticals and Wholesale.
Pharmaceuticals
The Pharmaceuticals segment develops and 
markets veterinary pharmaceutical products 
which are supplied to animal health professionals 
both directly and through our international 
distribution network. Our products fall into 
two categories: regulated pharmaceuticals and 
over the counter products. Products are either 
owned by the Group or licensed on long-term 
distribution agreements with third parties. We 
have a very broad portfolio of over 300 products 
including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, biocides 
and nutraceuticals and the Group focuses on 
certain niche therapy areas including odontology, 
dermatology, otology and surgery/anaesthesia. 
As a Group we invest significantly in our in-house 
development pipeline which I discuss later on in 
my report.
“ T h e key 
aim for our 
business is to 
create a cash- 
generative, 
growing pan-
European 
animal health 
company”

STRATEGIC REPORT 
OUR PERFORMANCE 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Following the acquisition this segment now includes the products 
that were previously categorised as Licensed Veterinary Medicines, 
Animal Welfare and Companion Animal Identification.
Based on the statutory results for the year ended 31
st
 December 
2017, sales in this division (net of intercompany sales) increased by 
28.4% to £59.7m (2016: £46.5m), which now accounts for 71.4% 
of total revenues. The £13.2m year-on-year increase is attributable 
to an additional £7.6m of sales derived from acquisition growth, 
with the balance generated through organic growth within the 
Ecuphar business.
Organic growth was driven by a number of factors including a 
very strong performance from sales into the Production Animals 
market, as well as strong growth from Companion Animals. 
In the division our top 20 pharmaceutical products, which account 
for 51% of this division’s total sales, grew by 15.1% in 2017. 
Looking at our direct sales markets, Orozyme, the first product 
of the Company that was developed, continues to hold a strong 
position in the Oro-dental area. Direct sales for this product grew 
by 11% and we expect to see further growth in this area through 
the launch of new innovative products in 2018. 
Leisguard, our treatment against leishmaniosis in dogs, showed 
strong sales across our Mediterranean footprint and we expect to 
see future growth for this product in 2018 in Scandinavia. Prazitel 
and Caniquantel, which both play an important role in the area of 
anti-parasitic treatment, also grew well in 2017.
We were pleased with the performance across our export 
network. Our key core export markets of France, the Nordics and 
UK and Ireland showed significant growth and we expect to benefit 
from ongoing direct sales in the UK now following the acquisition. 
During the period we signed new distribution agreements to cover 
New Zealand and Taiwan and both regions granted regulatory 
approval to sell Aqupharm (intravenous fluid range) and Isocare 
(anaesthesia), our recently launched products for use in surgery. 
This contributed to the growth of Aqupharm and Isocare sales, 
which were ahead of management expectations, and sales of core 
established brands such as Danilon (anti-inflammatory), Otoclean 
(dermatology) and Caniquantel (anti-parasitics) all showed double 
digit growth. Dinalgen (anti-inflammatory) sales were behind prior 
year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in 
major markets. 
The positive impact of the cross-selling opportunity was minimal 
during the year. We expect to see this contribute to our organic 
growth during Q4 2018, later than originally anticipated, with a 
more meaningful contribution in 2019.
The underlying EBITDA performance of our Pharmaceuticals division 
increased by 15.1% to £9.7m (97.1% of the Group’s underlying 
EBITDA) with reported EBITDA reducing to £7.5m (2016: £10.2m). 
Whilst this underlying growth was driven by the contribution of the 
acquisition, the organic performance in this division was impacted 
by lower gross margins, mainly due to a changing sales mix following 
higher growth from lower margin Production Animal products and 
export sales, as well as pricing pressures in a competitive market 
and the disposal of Nutriscience in 2016 which generated £1.3m of 
sales at margins in excess of 50%.
Whilst the impact of a changing sales mix and competitive pricing 
pressures are likely to persist over the rest of 2018 we expect to 
deliver at least double digit growth in underlying EBITDA in this 
division and to see further strong sales growth driven by a growing 
portfolio of products and a wider geographical sales reach for 
these products.
Wholesale
Our Wholesale division focuses on the sale of third-party 
veterinary pharmaceuticals, supplies and instruments in Belgium. 
Based close to Bruges, in the North West of Belgium, this business 
supplies veterinary professionals across the country and has been 
trading for 25 years and is well established in a stable market.
The extensive range of over 5,000 products includes own label 
and branded items ranging from small disposable items to larger 
capital equipment and diagnostic instruments. The division also 
specialises in the supply of surgical instruments.
Revenues increased by 9.7%, entirely through organic growth, to 
£23.9m (2016: £21.8m) with this division representing 28.6% of 
total Group sales. This division delivered underlying and reported 
EBITDA of £0.3m (2016: £0.5m) reflecting the investment made 
in sales staff to drive future growth. Growth was driven by the 
addition of new customers, as well as expanding the range of 
products sold to existing customers.
Product Development Pipeline
The focus on building value within our product development 
pipeline continues. As an enlarged business our development 
team is located across a number of sites providing extensive 
skills and capabilities across Belgium, Germany, Spain and UK. 
Karolyn Tapper, previously Director of Business Development for 
Animalcare Ltd, has been appointed to the new role of Group 
Head of Technical and Commercial Development to structure and 
integrate the teams to ensure that we continue to grow through 
investing in and attracting new product opportunities.
14 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
A project rationalisation and prioritisation process for all projects 
across the Group has been undertaken. Within the context of 
the enlarged Group, technical feasibility, development costs 
and commercial forecasts have been reviewed thoroughly to 
determine which projects would be continued. The Company is 
currently focused on 17 active new product development pipeline 
projects within Spain and UK.
In 2017 we launched Acecare, a sedative, from the original UK 
pipeline. Sales have been in line with the original project forecast. 
One centralised registration was submitted in 2017 and launch 
of this product is planned in late 2018. Progress of the pipeline 
continues and in 2018 three new products have already been 
registered across Europe with additional submissions planned 
throughout the year.
Alongside the new product development pipeline, a number of 
product improvement and product maintenance projects are 
ongoing. Several registrations to expand the global presence of our 
products were made in 2017 and launch within new territories is 
planned at the end of 2018 and during 2019.
New Products through Strategic Alliances  
and Partnerships
In addition to broadening our product portfolio through our own 
development pipeline, we are aware that our wide geographical 
footprint is attractive to similar companies in the US and Asia who 
are seeking routes to market for their products across Europe. 
During the period we have seen the first result of this strategy 
with an agreement with US-based Nutramax, to provide Europe-
wide distribution of their nutritional supplement Cosequin, which 
promotes canine joint health.
People
We currently have 100 sales representatives and 28 agents across 
Europe, having invested in an additional 6 sales representatives 
and support roles during the year. 
As a result of changes in senior and executive management in 
the Company it was necessary to find and appoint new Country 
Managers in Spain and the UK, the two key territories in the 
Group. This has been completed with the new recruits now in post 
in the weeks following the year end.
Internal appointments have also been made in the important 
areas of Technical and Product Development and Export. These 
new roles will progress the integration of the Group and help us to 
realise commercial opportunities more quickly.
It is clear that an appointment in supply chain management will be 
required in the near future to ensure the operational efficiencies 
of the Group within this area are achieved.
In addition, we announced at the end of April that Iain Menneer 
has stood down from his role as Chief Operating Officer. We are 
very grateful for all of Iain’s work on the integration of Animalcare 
and Ecuphar and we wish him well for the future. Iain’s role as 
COO will not be replaced and has been redistributed within the 
senior management team that he was accountable for, who will 
take on further responsibilities and report directly to myself.
The key component to ensuring we continue to deliver on our 
long-term growth strategy is to continue to attract and retain the 
highest calibre people to drive forward our development. I would 
like to extend my thanks to all of our staff for their hard work.
Brexit
The details of how the UK pharmaceutical regulations will be 
extracted from the current harmonised European structure are not 
yet clear. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (UK Government 
agency) is looking for close cooperation to enable a smooth 
transition to ensure animal welfare and food safety. The recent 
acquisition has enabled the new Group to start restructuring its 
pharmaceutical licence ownership with legal entities in the UK and 
Europe post-Brexit to allow uninterrupted commercial supply of 
product. We will continue to monitor the situation and take the 
necessary action to ensure business continuity.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
OUR PERFORMANCE 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4
Post-period end – Le Vet purchase by Dechra 
On 13
th
 February, Dechra plc acquired Le Vet Beheer B.V.  
(“Le Vet”), a business which has developed a portfolio of products, 
and established a network of marketing partners across Europe. 
Le Vet has been a long-term partner of Animalcare and Ecuphar 
with distribution agreements in four territories. Whilst certain 
distribution arrangements will not change, it is clear that this will 
not be the case across all of them. We are taking action now to 
mitigate against any material change which could adversely impact 
trading part way through 2019. 
Strategy and Outlook
The strategy of the business remains focused on building long-
term shareholder value by creating a growing, profitable and 
highly cash generative pan-European animal health platform, 
capable of investing in a steady flow of new products and 
rewarding shareholders with dividend payments. 
Further growth is expected through the execution of a clear 
strategy for growth via both organic sales growth and through 
targeted acquisitions. Our strategy for growth includes:
 { Cross-selling opportunities across customers and 
distribution channels
 { More synergies delivered through further integration of the 
businesses
 { Enhancing geographic footprint and sales, marketing and 
distribution network
 { Developing network of partnerships / strategic alliances to 
increase exposure to new opportunities
 { Identifying selective value-accretive acquisitions
 { Diversifying the portfolio of products into additional 
therapeutic areas within companion animal as well as 
production animal and equine markets
 { Broadening the product development pipeline to 
include novel therapies
We expect growth in revenues to be driven by the launch 
of new products from our development pipeline, additional 
regulatory approvals for our existing products in new territories 
and the distribution of new products for US or Asia based third 
parties across our European footprint. We also expect margin 
improvement to be seen as the opportunity to cross-sell products 
fully impacts as existing distribution agreements held by our UK 
business for Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Belgium are exited 
and replaced by our own direct sales network.
We believe we are on track to deliver double digit profit growth 
during 2018 and enhancement to profit margins will be driven 
by further synergies and cross-selling opportunities, which will 
start to take effect late in 2018 as integration progresses, but will 
deliver a more meaningful impact on profit margins during 2019 
as the full effect of these changes are felt.
We believe the business is well positioned for future growth  
and the Directors remain confident of delivering long-term 
shareholder value.
