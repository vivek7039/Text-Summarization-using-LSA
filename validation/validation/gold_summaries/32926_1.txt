OFFICER’S REVIEW
IDO ERLICHMAN
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Over the past 12 months we have 
delivered on our growth strategy. 
The group has made significant 
headway in developing our 
product suite, which has been 
greatly enhanced.
Introduction
When I joined Kape (formerly 
Crossrider plc) in May 2016, I did so 
with a clear vision of where I, with the 
full support of the Board, wanted to 
take this business. It was clear that 
despite our pedigree in digital marketing, 
our future laid beyond adtech. 
I am therefore delighted to look back at 
2017 as a year of significant strategic 
and operational progress. Over the 
past 12 months we have delivered on a 
number of key milestones and taken 
notable steps to becoming one of the 
leading next generation providers of 
consumer cybersecurity products.
We have built on our existing PC repair 
(Reimage) and device driver update 
(DriverAgent) solutions, through both the 
acquisition and internal development of 
new products during the year, which is a 
clear sign of our ambition.
Central to our strategy has been to 
shift our product focus to be B2C-driven 
and SaaS enabled thereby increasing 
our recurring revenue base, creating a 
more predictable sales platform from 
which to grow. 
We are therefore delighted to have 
delivered such a strong underlying 
EBITDA performance, up 172%, excluding 
the Web Apps and License segment, 
further demonstrating the excellent 
performance of our business model.
Operational update 
In March 2017, we acquired 
CyberGhost, a leading cybersecurity 
SaaS provider with a focus on the 
provision of virtual private network 
(“VPN”) solutions. The acquisition was 
successfully integrated into Kape by 
June 2017 and I am delighted to 
report, made a positive net profit 
contribution in the year of $1.5 million.
With CyberGhost now consolidated into 
the larger Kape operation, we have been 
successful in generating significant 
synergies and delivering superior 
customer traction post-integration with 
our digital user acquisition platform. This 
resulted in an increase in CyberGhost’s 
user base by over 30% compared to 
December 2016 and the last quarter of 
2017 saw record sales for the business 
in terms of volume and EBITDA. 
We have grown Kape’s product 
portfolio this year and it now consists 
of four main products: the CyberGhost 
VPN, a SaaS product, as well as the 
Reimage PC, DriverAgent and Reimage 
for Mac, which are purchased on a 
one-time and yearly unlimited use basis 
with a technical support component. 
We have started to implement a SaaS 
model in the Reimage PC and expect to 
see the results of this change towards 
the end of 2018 when the licences 
come up for renewal. In addition, 
we started to utilise the growth in our 
product offering and user base and we 
now offer to purchase CyberGhost and 
Reimage as a package, providing our 
customers the best in class products 
in one place.

KAPE TECHNOLOGIES PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
We have also been successful in 
growing our paying user base for 
Reimage and DriverAgent by over 18% 
and introduced a subscription based 
payment model. We also launched a 
Mac version of Reimage in September 
2017 to complement our highly 
successful PC solution. We believe 
this new release will substantially 
grow our potential addressable 
market for this product.
Given our focus on further 
strengthening our SaaS business model, 
2018 will be the first year we are able to 
generate significant revenues from our 
existing customer base. Therefore, 
during 2018, we expect to deliver $8.0 
million of recurring income from existing 
users

, which greatly improves both the 
visibility and quality of our earnings.
Cybersecurity market
Management identified the consumer 
cybersecurity space as presenting a 
significant opportunity for Kape, as a 
sizeable growth market with few nimble 
B2C focused-players that can easily 
adapt to the ever-changing digital 
landscape. As the internet has become 
increasingly central to people’s lives 
and concurrently hacking has also 
evolved significantly, the sharing of 
data online is posing an increasing 
threat to individuals’ online security. 
In 2004, the global cybersecurity market 
was worth $3.5 billion and in 2017 it was 
worth over $120 billion, representing 
growth of over 35 times in 13 years, with 
key growth drivers including:
3
• a growing number of internet users 
to c. 3.17 billion globally; 
• increased network and WiFi 
connectivity across the world; 
• commercial entities increasingly 
collecting personal data; 
• cybercrime targeting individuals, 
not just enterprise-level hacks; 
• heightened regulatory uncertainty 
around privacy and online security; 
and
• the emergence of the Internet 
of Things. 
The proliferation of internet users has led 
to a sizeable B2C cybersecurity 
marketplace, with the addressable 
market for personal digital safety in 2018 
estimated to be $10 billion. Kape is 
well-placed to capitalise on the increasing 
awareness of individuals to protect both 
their privacy and security online, as the 
Company has end-to end control over the 
user journey by leveraging its digital 
marketing technology and expertise. 
The Company’s renewed focus on the 
consumer cybersecurity market is 
increasingly coming to fruition, as 
evidenced by the strong performance 
of Kape’s core divisions and existing 
software solutions in 2017. This, 
coupled with the acquisition and 
successful integration and 
performance of CyberGhost, is a real 
testament to our ability to deliver in 
the cybersecurity space. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED
To implement the change in business 
model and focus on profitability, growth 
and earning predictability, we have 
instated five key performance indicators 
which guide how we measure the success 
of our operations across the business: 
• deferred income;
• adjusted operating cash flow;
• retention rate;
• paying users; and 
• premium subscriptions. 
Deferred income and adjusted 
operating cash flow are key measures 
as they demonstrate the true value of 
each product purchase from our 
customers, given that they recognise 
the benefits across the lifetime of the 
contract. Paying users and premium 
subscriptions represent our ability to 
grow our customer base and we expect 
these to grow over time. The retention 
rate is an indication of the quality of our 
service and products and our aim is for 
this to remain constant over time and 
improve in the medium term.

Rebranding 
Given the extensive re-engineering of 
the business, we took the decision to 
rename and rebrand the Company to 
Kape Technologies plc. Kape will be 
the future umbrella for all our products 
and services as we focus on delivering 
upon the following strategic priorities:
• strengthening and developing both 
our consumer and corporate brand 
globally;
• better leveraging product cross-
selling opportunities within the 
cybersecurity arena;
• growing our product offering 
through both organic growth and 
acquisitions;
• developing and increasing our 
marketing reach under a unified 
banner; and
• further strengthening our SaaS 
business, thereby increasing our 
recurring revenue base. 
Kape’s core principles are to be 
proactive, accessible and bold. We 
believe there is a real need for innovative 
solutions for customers and a 
requirement for online privacy and 
security as individuals manoeuvre 
through today’s ever-changing online 
environment. It is this shift in buying and 
browsing behaviour that is ultimately 
driving demand for our products. 
Current trading and outlook
Over the past 12 months we have 
delivered on our stated growth strategy. 
The Group has made significant 
headway in developing our product suite, 
which has been greatly enhanced by the 
addition of CyberGhost. The launch of 
Reimage for Mac is a great example of 
our internal development capability and 
our unique ‘in-house’ digital user 
acquisition expertise has enabled Kape 
to expand our user base globally.
We are motivated by the opportunities 
that exist within our growing portfolio 
of products and continue to constantly 
evaluate selective acquisition 
opportunities which could potentially 
broaden our software portfolio and 
accelerate our expansion into the 
global consumer cybersecurity market.
In 2018, we are focusing on two core 
growth initiatives:
• to continue to grow organically 
against our key KPIs, including 
users and revenues from our 
existing product portfolio; and
• to deliver on growth-enhancing 
acquisitions which incorporate the 
following criteria: 
 – a sizeable and growing user 
base;
 – an established recurring revenue 
model; and
 – the ability to deliver strong 
synergies with both Kape’s 
digital distribution capabilities 
and expertise.
We have made a strong start to 
2018, with record monthly sales, 
compared to the equivalent 
period in 2017, achieved across our 
products as we continue to reap 
the benefits of our renewed focus 
on the cybersecurity market. 
The Board therefore remains confident 
in delivering year-on-year growth in 
2018, in line with market expectations.
Special dividend
Following our robust performance 
this year and significant adjusted 
cash flow from operations of $7.6 
million, the Board has declared a 
special dividend of 4.93 US$ cents 
per share, amounting to a total of 
$7.0 million. This is the first special 
dividend the Company has issued; 
it follows the successful transition 
of the business, will contribute to 
maintaining balance sheet efficiency 
and reflects our confidence in the 
business. The dividend shall be paid 
in sterling and therefore it will be 
subject to a conversion exchange 
rate from US dollars based on a 
GBP/USD rate of 1.3887, being the 
rate at 4.30 pm on 12 March 2018; 
as a result shareholders will receive 
3.55 pence per share. The special 
dividend will become payable on 
13 June 2018 to those shareholders 
on the Company’s register as at the 
record date of 25 May 2018. The 
ex-dividend date is 24 May 2018.
