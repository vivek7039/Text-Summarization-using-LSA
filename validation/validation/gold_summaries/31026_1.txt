Group CEO’s strategic review
Delivering organic growth
Another year of progress
Zotefoams has performed strongly, delivering organic 
revenue growth of 22% to £70.15m (2016: 57 .38m) 
and profit before tax growth, before exceptional item, 
of 22% to £8.81m (2016: £7 .23m). Our strategy is to 
utilise our unique, cellular materials technology to 
manufacture value-added foam products and license 
related intellectual property. The markets in which we 
operate are driven by global trends – demographic, 
environmental and regulatory – which we believe offer 
potential for high rates of market growth as well as 
opportunity for our disruptive technology solutions. 
We measure strategic progress on four metrics, all 
before exceptional items:
1. Our HPP and MEL business units, which offer these 
unique, disruptive products and solutions, grew 32% 
and 56% respectively and together now account for 
25% of Group revenues.
2. Sales of our highly differentiated AZOTE
®
 polyolefin 
foam products grew by 18%, well above our target rate 
of twice global GDP growth.
3. Group operating margins were 13.4% (2016: 13.3%), 
as underlying operating profit, measured as the sum  
of segment margins, increased to 17 .2% (2016: 16.8%).
4. Group return on capital, which excludes large asset 
investments not yet commissioned, increased to 15.5% 
from 14.0%.
With record sales and profits in 2017 , Zotefoams is 
becoming more international, more diversified and has 
a strong portfolio of opportunities to deliver further 
organic growth in line with our stated strategic intent.
Human resources and embedding our culture  
to deliver
To deliver its potential Zotefoams needs talented 
people. We need to recruit, retain and motivate them 
as individuals and to work together in teams, often 
across geographic and cultural boundaries. As our 
business grows this is an increasing challenge. In 2017 
82% of revenues were outside the UK, the number of 
non-UK based employees increased by 14% and we 
invested 69% of capital outside the UK. Developing 
the right Group culture is important to complement 
the governance structures needed in a diverse, high-
growth business. Zotefoams’ culture is based around 
brand values and further development as a learning 
organisation, where lessons from failure may be the  
first step forward, where employees understand  
how we all contribute to the business and where  
we celebrate success and value the contribution  
of others. Within this structure, business units and 
brand leaders have significant autonomy to operate  
in a dynamic environment.
We recognise that matching our global talent base  
to our growth challenges is key to our success. 
Key investments
Zotefoams’ core autoclave technology is asset intensive 
with high barriers to entry on cost, lead-time and 
know-how. We took the decision in late 2014 to invest 
significantly in our site in Kentucky, USA and the $33m 
investment included infrastructure, extrusion and two 
high-pressure autoclaves, the first of which, HP1, has 
now been successfully commissioned. Recently, the 
Board of Zotefoams approved the commissioning 
of the second high-pressure autoclave (HP2) and 
With record sales and profits in 
2017 , Zotefoams is becoming more 
international, more diversified and has 
a strong portfolio of opportunities to 
deliver further organic growth in line 
with our stated strategic intent.

Our Kentucky plant begins 
production  
Following the decision late 
2014 to invest significantly 
in our Kentucky, USA plant, 
production of commercial 
AZOTE® foam commenced 
in February 2018. The plant 
is now a fully integrated 
production facility, adding 
extrusion and high-pressure 
autoclave capability to the 
already existing low-pressure 
foaming capability in place 
since 2001. 
Development of a more 
broadly based HPP 
business 
Sales in the HPP business 
unit grew 32%, with strong 
growth in ZOTEK® PEBA 
foams used in footwear as 
well as in the T-FIT® Clean 
range of products, which 
provide advanced insulation 
solutions to the biotech and 
pharmaceutical markets. 
Investing in people  
Talent attraction and employer 
branding are areas we have 
paid particular attention to in 
recent years, and in 2017 we 
have again seen the benefits 
of this investment through the 
highly skilled and qualified 
people we have hired.
associated extrusion equipment at an additional cost 
of $9m. This positions Kentucky as a significant, stand-
alone contributor to Group capacity, initially focused  
on AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams, with the site large enough 
for further investment if needed. During 2017 we also 
approved a £12m investment for infrastructure and 
two low-pressure autoclaves for our Croydon, UK site, 
primarily for expansion of our ZOTEK
®
 range of HPP 
foams. This recent acceleration of capacity investment 
is all growth related, with expectations of increased 
revenues driven by our portfolio of differentiated 
products and market opportunities. In total, we have 
committed to increasing our capacity by approximately 
45% over 2017 production run rates.
The HP1 investment cost more and took longer than 
initially anticipated. While this is disappointing, we have 
learnt significant lessons from this, including improved 
clarity on certain costs, management of the risks 
associated with long-lead-time, specialist, equipment 
and the potential opportunity loss from lack of capacity. 
We therefore emerge as a better-informed organisation, 
more capable of managing similar investments in the 
future, whilst recognising that risks to execution remain 
on large and complex capital projects.
Zotefoams’ organic growth strategy requires that we 
invest in product and market development as well as 
in the governance structure to support an increasingly 
international business. We have therefore seen a 
large increase in our administration and distribution 
costs, including technical and market development, 
linked to both current and expected future states of 
the Zotefoams business. Cost investment currently 
exceeds revenue in three major product groups, MuCell 
Extrusion, T-FIT
®
 insulation and ZOTEK
®
 N foams, 
which, together, represent £7 .1m of Group revenues 
(2016: £4.56m) and, we believe, are well positioned  
for long-term profitable growth. 
Current trading and outlook
The year has started positively, with first quarter  
order volumes 8% higher than 2017 and an increased 
proportion of higher-value HPP sales. Our investment 
in capacity in Kentucky, USA has now been 
commissioned and we made the first sales in February. 
We have also broken ground on our investment in 
Croydon, which increases low-pressure capacity for 
our HPP businesses by a factor of six. The Board has 
now approved the commissioning of our second high-
pressure autoclave in the USA, with a view to having 
this operational during 2019. 
We believe that investment in product and market 
development over the past years, together with 
investment in capacity to meet expected future levels  
of demand, leave us well placed to support future 
growth and, while being mindful of the risks posed by 
the macroeconomic environment and a strengthening 
in the value of sterling, the Board remains confident 
about the future prospects for our business.
Sales in Polyolefin foams increased  
by 18% to £52.82m (2016: £44.73m),  
with segment profit increasing by 29%  
to £10.29m (2016: £7 .96m).
AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams are manufactured using 
our unique, high-pressure nitrogen gas, autoclave 
process. This segment represented 75% of Group 
revenues and is the original and most diversified part 
of the Zotefoams business. AZOTE
®
 foams are more 
consistent, lighter weight and possess higher purity 
than foams manufactured using chemical technology. 
These attributes make our foams ideal for multiple use 
or “permanent” storage packaging, lightweight parts in 
aircraft, cars and trains, construction applications and 
medical equipment.
During 2017 we operated the Croydon facility at its 
effective capacity, increasing sales volumes globally 
by around 7%. Price increases and a better mix of 
sales, both by product and market, contributed 6% 
to revenue growth while more favourable exchange 
rates, mainly compared to the first six months of 2016, 
benefitted revenues by 5%. In continental Europe 
much of the mix impact was realised in Germany, 
where direct supply into a larger number of customers 
benefitted both pricing and business development.  
In North America the major impact was from our  
foam cutting operation in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which  
was operational for the full 12 months, increasing  
selling prices with their value-added processing  
of our materials. In the United Kingdom & Eire and  
Asia, revenues increased by 7% and 25% respectively.
The operational leverage impact of higher sales, while 
operating at capacity, meant that profits increased 
significantly in an environment of modest labour 
cost increases and stable prices for LDPE, our main 
raw material, despite a more difficult inflationary 
environment in some other materials and energy. 
Increasingly our sales resource is spent specifying 
our product at end users, often in collaboration with 
channel members. As additional capacity comes on 
line we believe this is the right approach to enhance 
the quality of our business, along with product range 
enhancement and selected value-added services.

HPP comprises ZOTEK
®
 technical foams 
and T-FIT
®
 insulation products. Sales 
increased by 32% to £13. 15m (2016: £9.99m) 
and segment profit increased by 27% to 
£3. 16m (2016: £2.48m).
HPP is a portfolio of products, where our unique 
autoclave technology is applied to a variety of high-
performance plastics to create foams with specific 
attributes. These attributes, such as excellent fire 
resistance, high-temperature performance, energy 
management, etc., are designed to meet the exacting 
needs of industries such as aviation, automotive, 
biotech and pharmaceutical and sports equipment. 
We see excellent opportunities to continue the growth 
experienced to date and we allocate resource and 
development priority accordingly. 
2017 saw very strong growth in ZOTEK
®
 PEBA foams 
used in footwear. In December 2017 we announced 
a significant strategic partnership with Nike, focused 
on this market segment, which is now receiving 
a substantially larger allocation of resource and 
investment aligned to its continued growth potential. 
ZOTEK
®
 F fluoropolymer foams are mainly sold for 
aviation applications and, although remaining the 
largest element of HPP , the 2017 performance was 
below expectations, and against trend, with sales 
declining year-on-year due mainly to destocking in 
the downstream supply chain to Boeing. ZOTEK
®
 
Nylon foam sales have developed as expected, with 
a growing portfolio of opportunities in transportation 
markets, but are currently a small part of this portfolio. 
Sales of T-FIT
®
 advanced insulation grew strongly 
within the biotech and pharmaceutical markets and,  
in late 2017 , we launched product line extensions,  
using a lower-cost manufacturing process, targeted  
at food, dairy and general process industries. 
During 2017 we continued the development of complex 
three-dimensional foams. The solid parts are made by 
injection moulding, rather than extrusion, which offers 
the possibility of creating bespoke parts that retain their 
shape when foamed in Zotefoams’ autoclave process, 
enabling Zotefoams to provide parts which are close 
to the final dimensions required by some end-users. 
The development is proceeding well and we expect 
a trial launch late in 2018. The development is initially 
focused on our ZOTEK
®
 foams, where material yield 
is particularly important due to the higher cost of the 
polymers used. 
MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’) licenses 
microcellular foam technology and sells 
related machinery. Sales increased by 56% 
to £4.25m (2016: £2.73m) and segment loss, 
before amortisation, increased to £(1.03)m 
(2016: £(0.40)m).
MEL ’s business model is to develop and license 
intellectual property (“IP”). MuCell
®
 technology offers 
the potential to reduce the plastic content of an article 
by around 15%, by injecting inert gas to displace plastic 
with microcellular bubbles. MuCell
®
 technology can be 
used with most common plastics and reduces material 
consumption with no negative impact on recycling. 
Initially, MEL will sell equipment to augment an existing 
extrusion line and, when the licensee is in production 
and saving money, MEL will collect a share of those 
savings as a licence fee and/or royalty payment. 
In 2017 equipment revenue grew 72% to £3.24m 
(2016: £1.88m), with one large contract accounting for 
approximately 39% of equipment sales, while licence 
fees and royalty revenue increased 19% to £1.01m 
(2016: £0.85m). Our potential base of royalty-generating 
machines grew 18%, with 131 MuCell
®
 units installed  
at MEL licensees (2016: 111). As there is often a time-
lag for end-user adoption, a key metric is the number 
of machines actually in production, which increased by 
46% to 83 machines (2016: 57), many of which are not 
yet operating at full potential. Segment loss increased 
as expected due to investment in people, including a 
dedicated IP manager, as well as non-recurring costs 
of £0.29m related primarily to write-downs of inventory, 
mostly costs of machinery developments which have 
been superseded. As most of the value created by 
MEL is royalty fees from contracts, often over terms 
exceeding 10 years, management is also measured 
on the expected present value of contracts. This key 
performance indicator increased significantly over 
the 12 months to 31 December 2017 . Management 
believes that increases in this metric, growing licence 
and royalty income, as well as creation of value through 
new IP , where we made good progress in 2017 and 
have some potentially significant developments to 
patent in 2018, continue to indicate a positive future  
for MEL.
