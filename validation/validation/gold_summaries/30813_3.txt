Overview
I am pleased to report that Domino’s has 
achieved another year of good growth, despite 
a more challenging market environment. 
The UK remains one of the leading franchises 
across the Domino’s network worldwide, 
and our franchisees are rightly considered 
to be among the very best anywhere in the 
world. Between them, they increased our 
UK network by a record 95 outlets and at the 
end of 2017 we traded from 1,045 stores 
in the UK. We also took the opportunity 
to acquire a majority stake in the largest 
franchisee in the London area. This will 
be a platform for more rapid growth in the 
currently under -developed London market, 
and for the development of innovation in 
technology, pricing and menus.
Outside our home market, progress has 
been encouraging. In the Republic of Ireland, 
we opened our first stores for six years 
in response to the strong economic 
recovery in that market. We are seeing 
an acceleration in growth in Switzerland, 
driven by changes to menu pricing and 
a very strong online performance.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

In our newer markets we took majority 
ownership in Iceland, Norway and Sweden 
during the year, and accelerated our growth 
plans in Norway by acquiring Dolly Dimple’s, 
the number three player. Just before the year 
end we announced plans to move to 95% 
ownership in Iceland. In Germany, where we 
are a 33% shareholder, Domino’s agreed 
terms to acquire the largest remaining 
independent pizza chain, Hallo Pizza. We 
are confident of the prospects for all of 
these markets, which offer a further exciting 
stage of growth for Domino's shareholders.

Capital allocation and 
returns to shareholders
One of the most distinctive aspects of the 
Domino’s business model is its strong cash 
generation. The Board has a rigorous approach 
to capital allocation – making sure that existing 
businesses are invested in to maintain and 
grow competitive advantage, appraising new 
growth opportunities, and returning cash 
to shareholders, all within an appropriate 
capital structure.
In this regard, 2017 has been a notable year. 
In respect of organic investment, we 
substantially completed our single biggest 
ever capital project, the new supply chain 
centre in Warrington, with a total budget of 
nearly £40m. In terms of expansionary growth 
opportunities, we made or announced £57.7m 
of acquisitions to strengthen and accelerate 
our ambition in several overseas markets, 
as described above. 
Cash returns to shareholders during the 
year totalled £77.0m, including £36.6m of 
share buybacks. We maintained our strong 
growth track record for the ordinary dividend, 
raising it by 12.5% to give a total dividend 
for the year of 9.00p. The proposed final 
dividend of 5.25p per share will, subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting on 19th April 2018, be paid on 24th 
April 2018 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 16th March 2018. 
Tveita, Oslo, 
Norway: “sell 
more pizza, have 
more fun.”
To support these uses of capital and to 
establish a more efficient funding structure, 
the Board also raised the Group’s leverage 
target to 1.75–2.5 times net debt to EBITDA. 
Given that the Group was in a net cash 
position only two years ago, this is clearly 
a significant development of policy, but we 
believe it gives us the necessary flexibility 
to pursue attractive growth opportunities, 
while maintaining a degree of conservatism 
should the environment deteriorate.
Our stakeholders
The enduring success of Domino’s owes 
much to the strength of its relationships 
with its key stakeholders. First and foremost, 
our franchisees continue to excel both against 
their competitors and their peers around 
the world. Their commitment to our 
customers, and to continuous business 
improvement, is as outstanding as ever.
I would also like to acknowledge the huge 
support of the global Domino’s network, 
and the benefits of knowledge sharing and 
brand visibility it brings; our suppliers, for 
the quality and reliability they bring to our 
partnership; and of course our customers, 
who remain as enthusiastic as ever about 
Domino’s pizza despite the increasing 
choices available to them.

Conclusion
2017 has been a year of significant evolution 
and progress, despite a weaker consumer 
environment in our core market. This reflects 
our belief in the strength of the business 
model and our determination to manage for 
the long term. Where we see opportunities 
to invest for growth, we will continue to 
take them, and I remain optimistic about 
our prospects.
