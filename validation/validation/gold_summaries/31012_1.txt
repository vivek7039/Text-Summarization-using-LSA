 Chief Executive’s strategic review
A year of portfolio 
transformation and 
strong profitable 
growth
Richard Tyson
Chief Executive Officer
2017 was a significant year for TT with strong revenue and profit 
growth ahead of expectations. In October we transformed the 
portfolio with the disposal of the Transportation Sensing and 
Control (Transportation) division for £123.2 million, realising value 
for the turnaround of the business and return to profit. We now have 
increased financial capacity and management time to continue to 
invest in and grow the business. Our enhanced position will allow 
us to accelerate our strategy to build leading positions in areas 
of the market where there are structural growth drivers and the 
proliferation of electronics is driving demand for our products.
Strategic progress
In 2017 we successfully transformed the portfolio while delivering 
strong organic profitable growth:
• Portfolio transformation: With the disposal of the 
Transportation division, TT is becoming a higher margin, higher 
quality business, with increased financial capacity to accelerate 
growth through capital investments and acquisitions. 
• Strong organic profitable growth: Favourable market 
conditions combined with a strong sales performance have 
driven strong growth and margin improvement in the continuing 
business, with organic growth in all three divisions.
Portfolio transformation
In October we completed the disposal of the Transportation 
division, realising value for the turnaround of the business and 
return to profit. Under strong leadership, the Transportation 
division made significant progress:
• turned-around and returned to profit;
• re-focused R&D efforts on sensing and control for safety, 
fuel efficiency and emission control;
• achieved sales success in faster growing geographies; and
• broadened its customer base.
The strategic progress that we had achieved enabled us to realise 
the value for the business earlier than anticipated. The net proceeds 
on the disposal originally estimated in the circular at £100.7 million 
are now expected to total £111.0 million with the increase as a result 
of normal working capital adjustments, together with a substantially 
lower expected tax burden.
Following the disposal, we restructured our remaining divisions 
to improve our routes to market, and better serve our customers 
to support future growth. 
2017 performance
2017 was a pivotal year for TT. Following the disposal of the 
Transportation division, TT is becoming a higher margin, higher 
quality business with good cash conversion. Business performance 
was excellent and we delivered organic growth from all three 
divisions. Our strategy to focus on areas of the market where 
our industry expertise and R&D investment create strong and 
differentiated capabilities is delivering results, driving growth and 
margin improvement. 
06 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com “2017 was a pivotal year for TT. 
We are delighted with both the strong 
trading performance and the disposal 
of  the Transportation division.”
How would you describe the performance 
of the business in 2017?
I am delighted with the performance of the Group in 
2017. All three divisions delivered organic growth, 
underlying profit before tax grew by more than 25% 
and our cash conversion was excellent. Following on 
from a strong business performance in 2016, the 
excellent business performance in 2017 was 
delivered in a year when we also transformed 
our portfolio.
How significant was the disposal of the 
Transportation division to your strategy?
The disposal of the Transportation division has 
transformed TT. We were able to realise the value for 
the turnaround of the division ahead of expectations. 
We were pleased with the value achieved and as a 
result, have increased financial capacity to invest 
in the remaining business which will accelerate 
our progress. 
Why have you chosen to focus on three of 
your previous strategic priorities for 2018?
Given the progress and financial performance 
of the Group, we are taking an opportunity to put 
even more effort and resources behind new product 
development; business development; and continuing 
our good work with operational excellence. We intend 
to develop more value-added solutions, developing 
more custom assemblies and products, further up the 
value chain in response to customer demand. We will 
couple this with extra support for our customer facing 
teams including training and development for our 
business development function. In parallel, we 
will continue our efforts on BE Lean which is well 
embedded within our organisation and improving 
the efficiency of our operations.

Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Chief Executive’s strategic review continued
Group revenue for 2017 was £360.0 million (2016: £332.7 million) 
an increase of 8 per cent and 5 per cent excluding the £9.3 million 
benefit from foreign exchange. Our strong sales performance and 
improved market demand have contributed to good growth this 
year. The focus on operational excellence has enabled us to 
increase capacity and maintain lead times resulting in market 
share gains in our current sensing, circuit protection and signal 
conditioning product lines. The Group’s order book has improved 
compared to the same time last year in part because of customers 
placing orders further ahead than at this time last year.
Underlying operating profit
1
 increased by 18 per cent to £24.3 million 
(2016: £20.6 million), and by 12 per cent excluding a foreign exchange 
benefit of £1.1 million. Statutory operating profit was £20.0 million 
(2016: £18.8 million). The improvement was driven by the Sensors 
and Specialist Components and Power Electronics divisions. Foreign 
exchange headwinds in the second half were offset by early delivery 
of efficiency savings post the disposal of the Transportation division. 
Underlying operating profit margin for the Group has improved by 60 
basis points to 6.8 per cent (2016: 6.2 per cent) and return on invested 
capital increased by 140 basis points to 10.6 per cent (2016: 9.2 per 
cent). We delivered another year of excellent cash conversion of 98 per 
cent (2016: 79 per cent) and a free cash inflow of £4.7 million (2016: 
£13.8 million). Closing net funds at the end of the year were £47.0 
million (2016: net debt £55.4 million). 
Strong organic profitable growth
All three divisions
2
 delivered organic revenue growth resulting 
from a combination of market share gains, improved key customer 
relationships and a good sales performance.
Sensors and Specialist Components revenues were £142.3 million 
(2016: £129.5 million) an increase of 10 per cent and 6 per cent at 
constant currency (excluding a £5.0 million positive foreign exchange 
impact). The increase in revenues was a result of market share 
gains and positive market demand in Europe and Asia. Underlying 
operating profit improved to £18.8 million (2016: £15.6 million), an 
increase of 21 per cent or 15 per cent excluding a £0.7 million foreign 
exchange benefit. The profitability of the division improved as a result 
of operational leverage on the organic revenue growth (see page 30)
Power Electronics revenues increased by 14 per cent to £64.2 million 
(2016: £56.2 million), up 12 per cent on an organic basis including 
the now complete one-off last time buy activity associated with 
moving production from Fullerton in the US to our Bedlington facility 
in the UK. The growth was a result of continued platform growth in 
aerospace and defence and the ramp up of product lines that were 
outsourced to us from a global engine manufacturer. Underlying 
operating profit improved to £6.2 million (2016: £5.0 million), up 24 
per cent. The increase was due to operational leverage (see page 32).
Global Manufacturing Solutions revenues increased by 4 per cent 
to £153.5 million (2016: £147.0 million), with constant currency 
revenue growth of 2 per cent. Revenue growth was stronger in the 
second half. There was a favourable foreign exchange impact of 
£4.2 million. Revenue growth was strong in Asia driven by customers 
in medical and transportation sectors. Underlying operating profit 
increased from £6.3 million in 2016 to £6.5 million in 2017. There 
was a positive foreign exchange impact of £0.4 million. Underlying 
operating profit improved in the second half as a result of operational 
leverage on increased revenues. Underlying operating margins were 
4.2 per cent (2016: 4.3 per cent) (see page 34).
Realising benefits from management actions started in 2015 
We delivered strong revenue and profit growth, realising the benefit 
from management actions we started in 2015 around improving 
our customer focus, increasing our R&D activities and enhancing 
our operational efficiency.
Our increased customer focus has resulted in new customer wins 
and increased sales to existing customers. This includes multi-year 
contracts won with an aerospace and defence OEM customer in 
the US for printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and design for 
manufacture and testing that will drive growth for the future. In 
addition, we have identified key customers where we have the 
potential to develop strategic relationships. We also further 
developed our strategic supplier relationship with Rolls-Royce 
for power and control microcircuits.
Our focus on R&D and increased R&D spend has resulted in 
16 new products launched in the year. These new product launches 
will position us for continued growth in years to come. Four of our new 
products launched were in the current sensing, circuit protection and 
signal conditioning product lines, an area where our operational 
efficiency actions have resulted in market share gains and we have 
benefited from a surge in market demand. We are continuing to see 
good benefits from our BE Lean programme. During the year, we 
trained the next cohort of Master Lean Practitioners, using our own 
BE Lean experts.
Safety is of paramount importance to us and we have seen good 
progress in our zero harm measures which continue their momentum. 
Safety performance improved 13 per cent in 2017. Since 2015, lost 
time accidents have more than halved. Our employees continue to 
manage and prioritise health and safety and we are now rolling out 
a behavioural based safety programme as we move into 2018 
(see page 25).
TT has seen good growth with 
customers in aerospace and defence

08 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com We continue to prioritise the engagement of our employees 
and making TT a great place to work. We are also conscious of the 
diversity position across our employee base. We pay our employees 
equally for equal roles, and employ a workforce that comprises 52 
per cent female employees and 48 per cent male employees. The 
gender diversity of our senior leadership is reflective of the industry 
and we are looking to proactively improve our diversity at this level 
in the organisation through our internal development plans, 
our recruitment processes, and encouraging new talent to 
join the industry. 
We remain committed to promoting apprentice schemes 
throughout the organisation, championing young talent and 
nurturing our leading experts of the future. Our progress is 
demonstrated by our employee engagement score of 4.73 
which has continued to improve since the launch of our TT 
Way behaviours in 2015 (see page 25).
Our markets
We focus our strategy on segments of our four end markets where 
there are structural growth drivers across industrial, aerospace and 
defence, medical and transportation markets. TT is well positioned 
in these markets, with long-standing customer relationships. By 
focusing on areas of the market where our industry expertise and 
focused R&D investment are creating differentiated capabilities, 
we will help our customers solve their most complex challenges. 
Across our end markets there are varying growth dynamics. 
Intermediate sub-systems for a range of our industries are forecast to 
grow at a 2.1 per cent CAGR from 2015 to 2019, reaching USD$1.61 
billion. As the world becomes ever more interconnected, electronics 
are proliferating as the level of automation and intelligence in and 
across devices is multiplying in virtually all spheres of industry, 
business, infrastructure and our homes with increasing pace. We 
are focused on end markets that are benefitting from increasing 
electronic content, ensuring exposure to long term favourable 
growth trends for the business. Read more on our four market 
areas on pages 12–13.
Our strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on building 
leading positions in areas of the market where there are structural 
growth drivers driving the proliferation of electronics and increased 
demand for our solutions. We concentrate our time and resources in 
market areas where our industry expertise and R&D investment 
creates strong and differentiated capabilities that are valued by 
our customers. 
Following the disposal of the Transportation division, we have 
increased financial capacity and management time to continue to 
invest in and grow the business. As a result of the progress we have 
delivered, we are increasing our investment to step up our existing 
activities in R&D and business development. These investments will 
support our ambition to deliver even more value-added solutions to 
our customers. We will continue our focus on operational excellence 
that has been delivering results. These priorities support our 
commitment to solve our customers’ toughest electronics 
challenges by engineering smarter solutions together.
Strategic priorities in 2018
 Value-added product solutions
As TT moves to be a higher margin, higher value, and product 
focused business, the requirement for value-added product solutions, 
innovation and R&D is increasing. By deploying additional resources 
in our research and development function, we will prioritise increasing 
the effectiveness of our R&D spend and accelerate our ability to move 
up the value-chain where our customers support us doing so to 
develop smarter solutions together. 
 Business development
We are focused on ensuring our business development function is 
fit for purpose as TT builds momentum with new product launches 
and developing strategic partnerships with our customers. We will 
increase our efforts around training and developing our people to 
promote a solutions-based sales approach and focus on continuing 
to develop strategic customer relationships.
 Operational excellence
We want our customers to recognise TT for our operational 
excellence. Alongside continuing our BE Lean activities, which 
have seen success in enabling us to win market share in our current 
sensing, circuit protection and signal conditioning product lines, we 
are focused on optimising our operations and taking sensible actions 
to improve our procurement effectiveness. (see pages 10–11)
Capital deployment
In February 2018, we announced the recommended cash offer for 
Stadium Group plc (Stadium) for a total consideration of approximately 
£45.8 million plus net debt acquired of £11.8 million. Stadium is a 
leading supplier of design led technologies with customers in the 
industrial, aerospace and defence, medical and transportation sectors. 
The acquisition will give TT a greater presence in attractive segments; 
enhanced product capabilities in power electronics and connectivity; 
extended R&D capabilities; and a complementary customer base 
providing cross selling opportunities. We look forward to completing 
the acquisition and welcoming Stadium’s employees to TT.
We continue to review sensible acquisition opportunities where we 
can deploy capital to add complementary capabilities, customers 
and scope to TT. 
Outlook
2017 was a pivotal year for TT. We are delighted with both the 
strong trading performance and the disposal of the Transportation 
division. TT is becoming a higher margin, higher quality business 
with increased investment capacity to accelerate growth. 
We enter 2018 benefitting from the increasing proliferation of 
electronics in our markets. We are focusing our resources where we 
have strong and differentiated capabilities and are again increasing 
our investment in R&D and business development to maximise this 
opportunity. Momentum in our operational performance and our 
improved order book give us confidence, despite current foreign 
exchange headwinds, of making strong progress in 2018.
