 STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Our business
Over the 31 years since Shaftesbury was formed, we have assembled 
an impossible-to-replicate portfolio in the heart of London’ s 
West End of some 600 buildings across 14½ acres. The renowned 
and enduring appeal of London’ s West End to a global audience 
of visitors and businesses brings a resilience to its economy not 
seen elsewhere in the UK and in very few cities across the world.
Underpinned by an estimated 200 million annual visits to the 
West End, our business focusses on the 1.1 million sq. ft. of restaurant, 
leisure and retail space that we own in high profile, popular locations. 
With our forensic knowledge of the West End, we curate 
distinctive, interesting and lively destinations which attract 
Londoners, a large and important local working population, 
domestic visitors, and international tourists in numbers 
unmatched by any city destination in the western world. 
Continuing value creation and 
income growth
Our portfolio, now valued
1
 at £3.64 billion, continues to deliver 
rental and capital growth, but with relatively low capital 
expenditure. 
We have continued our long record of crystallising our portfolio’ s 
reversionary potential into contracted cash flow, whilst growing 
this potential further. Together with significantly reduced finance 
costs following important refinancing activity, this has driven 
strong growth in earnings over the year. The Board is delighted 
to recommend a final dividend of 8.1p, bringing the total 
distribution for the year to 16.0p, an increase of 8.8%. This 
follows last year’ s increase of 6.9%.
Focus on culture, governance 
and sustainability 
In my first year with Shaftesbury, I have come to appreciate the 
culture of this business and the important part it plays in supporting 
our strategy and our continuing success. Importantly, our strategy, 
and every aspect of its implementation, prioritises long-term 
goals, planning and sustainable outcomes over short-term gains 
and rewards. 
We pride ourselves in being open, transparent and engaged, 
not just with shareholders but also with our wide array of 
stakeholders, including our employees, local communities, 
neighbours and local authorities. We ensure that our Board 
decision-making includes consideration of these important 
stakeholders. 
The Board and I are committed to maintaining the high standards 
of corporate governance and behaviour we have demonstrated 
for many years. 
Succession planning throughout the organisation is an essential 
aspect of our long-term strategy. My responsibility is to ensure 
that the Board’ s membership continues to evolve so that we 
have access to the broad skills and experience required to 
support the current and future needs of the business.

STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
The knowledge and enthusiasm of our management team have been critical 
to the successful implementation of our strategy. Our employee retention 
record, which is a testament to the working environment we offer , is exceptional. 
We invest in training and developing our employees, to ensure they grow in 
their roles and that we maintain a pipeline of talent for internal promotion.  
A key aspect of our long-term success is the socially responsible way in 
which we run our business. We see the preservation and enhancement of 
our iconic destinations as critical to our long-term future and we are 
committed to bringing economic and environmental sustainability through 
the stewardship of our extensive ownership of mainly older buildings. 
Creating prosperous, appealing locations which support the businesses of 
our commercial occupiers, and which benefit the important residential 
communities in and around our areas, creates the conditions which sustain 
the long-term prospects of our business. 
Board changes
Oliver Marriott retired from the Board in July and I would like to thank him 
for his outstanding contribution to Shaftesbury during his eight-year tenure. 
On 28 November 2017, Richard Akers will join the Board as a non-executive 
director, and I am sure his broad range of real estate and corporate skills 
and experience will be invaluable.
Outlook
Whilst UK economic and political uncertainty is unsettling business 
confidence and investment, London continues to thrive. Its long-term 
prospects, and those of the West End, are underpinned by their global 
status and appeal, excellent connectivity and dynamic, creative, broad-
based economy. 
Over my first year, it has become increasingly apparent that this business 
has many strengths, from our exceptional portfolio through to a quality 
team, a proven and evolving long-term strategy and a robust balance sheet. 
I am confident we shall continue to meet today’ s challenges, capture 
tomorrow’ s opportunities and maintain our long record of delivering 
sustained growth in income, capital value and shareholder returns.

With increasing numbers of visitors to the West End and the widely-recog-
nised growth in interest and spending on leisure activities, our 282 restau-
rants, cafés and pubs are important drivers of footfall and trading in our 
locations.
