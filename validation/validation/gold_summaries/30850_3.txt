Strategic report
DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
The Board was very pleased with 
the Group’s performance this year. We 
maintained strong levels of investment 
outperformance for our clients after 
all fees, which is our primary aim. This 
strong investment performance enabled 
us to retain existing clients and attract 
new ones. New clients came from 
across an increasingly broad distribution 
network of partners with wider 
geographical reach. This resulted in 
significant net inflows of £5.5bn into 
our increasingly diversified range of 
investment strategies and products. 
The increase in assets under 
management to £50.2bn contributed 
to a 1 3% rise in statutory profit before 
tax to £192.9m (on an underlying basis 
this was £193.8m).
Investment outperformance
During the year, a significant amount 
of hard work was undertaken to 
ensure that we can continue to deliver 
investment outperformance for clients 
and thus financial results for shareholders. 
This included investing in our business 
by recruiting and developing existing 
employees in the fund management 
strategy teams to broaden and deepen 
our investment capability. It also included 
substantial changes to our operating 
platform in preparation for all the 
requirements of MiFID II. 
Earlier in the year we announced 
changes to pricing for our UK unit trusts 
and that Jupiter would meet the cost of 
research used in our fund management 
process. Both of these changes benefit 
clients and increase transparency, 
enabling them to more easily assess the 
investment performance after all fees. 
Dividends to shareholders
Jupiter’s progressive dividend policy 
targets an ordinary payout of 50% 
of our underlying earnings per share. 
In order to provide shareholders with 
a smoother flow of returns, we 
rebalanced the dividend this year 
towards the interim. We increased it 
to 6.8p per share from the 4.5p paid 
in 2016. The Board is now declaring a 
full‑ year dividend of 10.3p per share 
(2016: 10.2p), to give a total ordinary 
dividend of 17.1p, up 16%.
In addition, the Group’s financial results 
and strong balance sheet allow us to 
announce a special dividend of 15.5p 
per share for 2017 (2016: 12.5p per 
share), giving a total dividend of 32.6p. 
This will be paid at the same time as 
the full‑ year dividend. Special dividends 
enable us to deliver returns to our 
shareholders sooner rather than later, 
using cash we do not need to hold 
for other purposes and we remain 
committed to this policy.
Taking the ordinary and special 
dividends together, shareholders will 
receive a total of 32.6p. This represents 
a 20% increase on last year, and a 
distribution of 95% of our underlying 
earnings. 
A consistent strategy
Under Maarten Slendebroek’s leadership, 
Jupiter has followed a consistent strategy, 
with investment outperformance for our 
clients at its heart, which has successfully 
diversified and grown the Group. 
During the year, the Board reviewed 
the strategy in detail in the context of 
Jupiter’s evolving markets, our success to 
date and the environment of significant 
change around us. The Board reaffirmed 
the strategic direction of the Group. 
It is confident that Jupiter’s position 
as an active fund manager focused 
on investment performance after all 
fees can support its continued growth.
Board and governance
We were delighted to welcome Roger 
Yates as a Non‑ Executive Director in 
October 2017. Roger led Henderson’s 
successful global expansion and has 
over a decade of non‑ executive 
experience on the boards of UK financial 
services companies. His insights will be 
invaluable as we move forward.
Lorraine Trainer has decided to retire 
from the Jupiter Board and will not be 
seeking re‑ election at the Company’s 
AGM on 18 May 2018. Lorraine joined 
the Board in May 2010 at the time of 
the IPO and served as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee from May 2011 
to June 2017 and Senior Independent 
Director from September 2014 to July 2017. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
express my gratitude to Lorraine for 
her support and significant contribution 
during her eight years on the Board. 
Lorraine has brought energy, commitment 
and a different perspective to the Board 
and this has been invaluable to Jupiter 
as the business has grown and 
developed. Her experience and insight 
will be missed.
During the year, we completed a 
full external Board evaluation, which 
confirmed that the Board and its 
committees continue to function well. 
People and culture
Jupiter has good gender balance at 
Board level but this is not replicated in 
all areas of the Group. While we ensure 
we pay men and women the same for 
performing the same roles to the same 
performance levels, the high percentage 
of senior fund manager and sales 
positions held by men is the driver of 
our gender pay gap. We expect the 
gender pay and bonus gaps between 
female and male employees to gradually 
decline as we recruit and develop senior 
female talent across the business.
Jupiter has a strong culture and a 
set of values that are central to our 
business. They ensure we put clients 
first, collaborate effectively and remain 
conviction led. Our people embody 
these values and I want to thank 
everyone at Jupiter for their contribution 
to the Group’s success this year.
Looking forward
There are undoubtedly challenges in the 
external environment, most specifically 
the uncertainties surrounding Brexit. The 
Board believes that Jupiter has a robust 
and sustainable business model and is 
confident that, with the delivery of value 
for clients, Jupiter can continue to thrive.
