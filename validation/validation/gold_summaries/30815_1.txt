 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Paul Forman 
Chief Executive
Having been appointed as Chief 
Executive of Essentra on 1 January 2017 , 
I am pleased to present my first  
Annual Review. 
In summary, following a period of 
turbulence, we did much in 2017 to 
stabilise Essentra; this was not only with 
regard to our operational performance 
metrics, but also in terms of starting  
to win back lost credibility with our 
customers, improving engagement  
with our employees and creating a stable 
balance sheet supported by markedly 
improved cash flow control. At the same 
time, we have developed and articulated  
a sustainable, data-driven corporate 
strategy which will see the various 
activities which comprise the Essentra 
Group restored to profitable growth over 
the medium term behind a talented and 
engaged workforce. At the heart of this 
change programme is our people, where 
the establishment of an agreed set of 
principles and the absolute priority of 
health and safety have been critical 
developments in the culture of excellence 
which we are seeking to create and embed 
across Essentra. 
There is clearly much for us all still to do, 
and this will take time; however, now a 
year into my tenure, I am encouraged by 
the progress we have made to date and  
by the positive energy for change across 
the organisation. 
Financial performance 
FY 2017 revenue decreased 2.3% (at 
constant exchange), with a like-for-like 
decline of 2.0%. The underlying result 
reflected an improved revenue trend in the 
second half of the year, with a continued 
strong result in Component Solutions and  
a material improvement in Filter Products 
offset by a decrease in Health & Personal 
Care Packaging. With a significantly 
positive foreign exchange benefit, together 
with a modest decline from change in 
scope owing to the divestment of the 
Bristol consumer packaging site in June 
2017 , total revenue increased 2.9% to 
£1,027 .3m. 
On an adjusted basis, operating profit  
was down 26.8% (at constant exchange) 
at £84.6m. The 280bps reduction in the 
margin (at constant exchange) to 8.2% 
was largely driven by Health & Personal 
Care Packaging – notably the profit 
drop-through from lower revenue, 
together with a material operating loss  
at our folding cartons site at Newport,  
UK and the impact of hurricane Maria on 
our facilities in Puerto Rico – as well as a 
less profitable revenue and segment mix  
in Tapes. There was a £2.1m decrease in  
our financing costs resulting from a lower 
average net debt position during the year 
and our tax rate was maintained at 20.0%, 
contributing to basic adjusted earnings  
per share (at constant exchange) reducing 
by 30.1% to 22.1p. 
During the year, there was further 
investment in our footprint and equipment, 
with FY 2017 net capital expenditure of 
£45.3m: we also made good progress with 
regard to net working capital management, 
which supported a cash conversion ratio  
of 94.6%. As such, and boosted by net 
proceeds from the divestment of Porous 
Technologies of £210.8m, our financial 
ratios remain robust, with net debt to 
EBITDA of 1.7x and interest cover of 9.0x  
as at 31 December 2017 . As a result, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend  
of 14.4p per share – implying a FY 2017 
dividend of 20.7p per share, unchanged 
versus FY 2016. 
 
My initial impressions
When I joined Essentra, it was clear that 
the Company had experienced a number 
of challenges. Most evident of these was 
the poorly executed integration of the 
Clondalkin Specialist Packaging Division 
(“SPD”), which resulted in certain material 
commercial and operational issues which 
were significantly weighing on the financial 
performance. Beyond this, however, were 
a number of other root causes: Essentra 
did not have a clearly defined corporate 
strategy; the “matrix” organisational 
structure was a source of confusion  
and a consequent lack of accountability; 
there was a conspicuous lack of rigorous 
and consistent process; and the IT 
infrastructure was fragmented and had 
been underinvested. Taking these issues 
together, it was unsurprising, therefore, 
that employee morale was very low and 
there had been an exodus of talent.
Notwithstanding these challenges, my 
initial view was that the Essentra Group  
is comprised of strategically attractive 
businesses, virtually all of which hold 
leadership or number two positions in their 
respective markets, and many of which 
have sustainable organic (and possibly 
acquisition) growth potential thanks to 
their strong competitive advantage and 
their loyal, blue chip customer base. 
Critically, I met many excellent and 
passionate colleagues, who believed in  
the fundamental strengths of Essentra 
and were enthused by the prospect for 
positive change. Accordingly, the issues  
to be overcome were predominantly 
self-inflicted – rather than end-market 
related – and there were solid foundations 
upon which to build.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW “During 2017 , we 
successfully restored 
stability across the 
organisation – from 
our people and 
customers to our 
processes and 
finances. A year into 
my tenure, my belief 
in a bright future  
for our Company  
is – if anything –  
even stronger than 
my initial view.”
2017 – a year of stabilisation …
While it was important to initiate the 
strategy development programme at the 
earliest opportunity, at the same time we 
needed to restore stability to the Company 
– from our people and customers to our 
processes and finances.
My priority as Chief Executive is to provide 
employees with a safe, respectful and 
diverse environment, where people want 
to come to work in the morning. In the  
first instance, therefore, it was imperative 
to start to rebuild our corporate culture, 
and to develop and communicate an 
agreed set of values – as well as where  
we aim to take the business and why – to 
ensure we are all clear as to how we should 
behave while in the workplace, as well as 
how we will together build Essentra into 
the best company it can be. Accordingly, 
we established our six principles and three 
steps to long-term success – being Stability, 
Strategy and Growth – which were rolled 
out across the business, supported by  
an extensive programme of video 
communication in all languages and 
townhall presentations. In addition, we 
needed an unambiguous organisational 
structure, which resulted in the disbanding 
of the previous Strategic Business Unit  
and regional matrix in favour of three 
global divisions, each with profit & loss 
accountability and clear lines of reporting 
and responsibility.
Following a period of significant footprint 
change, too often to the detriment of our 
commercial relationships, we undertook  
to stabilise our business and to regain 
revenue momentum behind a new set  
of customer retention initiatives. In the 
case of certain underperforming sites, this  
also entailed the injection of turnaround 
resource – both in terms of judicious 
financial investment and dedicated, 
experienced personnel. This significant 
focus and remedial action was particularly 
evident in Health & Personal Care 
Packaging, as we sought to arrest the 
significant rate of revenue and profit 
decline during the second half of 2016, 
especially at those sites impacted by the 
acquisition integration: we also moved 
rapidly to start to address systems 
challenges and simplify our infrastructure 
in IT, and changed the reporting line of the 
Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) directly 
to me to reflect the critical importance of 
the task ahead.
While 2017 marks the outset of our 
three-step corporate change programme, 
nonetheless we made meaningful progress 
in driving widespread stability during the 
year: compared to a low point in H2 2016, 
our revenue trends have steadied; our key 
performance indicators (notably service 
and quality metrics) have increased 
demonstrably in all three divisions, which 
has helped to enhance the dialogue we are 
having with customers; we have delivered 
a number of successful commercial and 
operational initiatives; and our employee 
engagement surveys have shown excellent 
levels of participation, with improvement 
in all key areas (albeit from a low base,  
in some cases) versus 2016. Underpinning  
all of this is a robust balance sheet and a 
very good level of cash conversion in the 
business, and towards the end of the year 
we successfully refinanced our entire debt 
facilities to extend maturities at attractive 
rates – including the issue of US$75m of  
US Private Placement notes – to ensure 
stability in our finances over the medium 
to long term. 
… and strategic development
Entailing eight different workstreams, the 
aim of our strategy review was to provide 
a well-defined and objective assessment 
of the current status and positioning of 
the various business activities within the 
Essentra organisation, together with  
their future potential. Presented to the 
financial markets at the time of our 
interim results on 28 July 2017 , the output 
of this six-month review has been a clear 
corporate strategy (with options) which is 
aligned to a three-year plan, and provides 
a data-driven view of the areas which may 
require measured additional investment in 
capability / process and of how we intend 
to drive future growth. Ahead of our 
external presentation, however, I was 
pleased to have the opportunity to discuss 
the findings from the strategy review with 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
11
STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW our leadership teams from across Essentra 
at our global Management Conference  
in June. Involving a much wider group than 
has previously been so directly involved of 
almost 100 people, I greatly valued their 
contribution to our future, and they have 
collectively done a fantastic job of 
communicating our strategy to their 
respective organisations, to ensure that 
our employees fully understand the 
direction in which we are heading and the 
reasons why , and to solicit their comments 
and questions.
Overall, the strategy review confirmed my 
initial assessment; namely, that the nine 
businesses comprising the Essentra Group 
have strong and defensible strategic 
positions, with operating margins which 
can be sustained or – in the case of Health 
& Personal Care Packaging – improved to 
industry norms over the medium term.  
As part of the review, we also determined 
that with effect from 1 January 2018 –  
and to provide greater focus across the 
portfolio, we should be grouped into three 
global divisions of Components, Packaging 
and Filters, with the creation of a fourth 
Specialist Components division to separately 
manage our six smaller businesses. In 
addition, we clearly defined the role of  
the overall Group in driving value. 
In order to support our stability and future 
growth agenda, we identified the need for 
an incremental £30m of investment over 
three years in key areas; of this, c. £10m is 
IT-related and approximately £20m is to 
drive an equipment upgrade programme 
in Packaging.
Components
Combining the expertise and credibility of  
a manufacturer with the service orientation 
of a distributor there are a number of 
factors which make the c. £8bn Bill of 
Materials “small components” market 
attractive to Essentra. Competitors –  
of which there are hundreds – are either 
distributors or niche manufacturers; it  
is difficult for new entrants to establish 
themselves in a meaningful way due  
to the high cost to produce moulds to 
manufacture standard parts across a  
very broad range of Stock Keeping Units 
(“SKUs”) ; Asia remains a large, growing and 
relatively underdeveloped region; and good 
margins are generally available – among 
other factors. Indeed, no major changes  
in market dynamics or customer needs  
are foreseen in the immediate future.
While there are opportunities for 
improvement – including cross-selling 
across product categories and the rate  
of new customer acquisition – the strategy 
for Components is essentially one of 
evolution from a strong and relatively 
unique proposition. However, over and 
above the scope to grow the division 
organically through expanding into 
faster-growing geographies and adjacent 
product ranges, there is also potential to 
achieve this through bolt-on transactions. 
Indeed, the acquisition of Micro Plastics –  
a leading provider of fasteners – at the  
end of the year, was a great example of the 
consolidation opportunities available to us; 
not only does Micro Plastics significantly 
enhance our offering in the US for one of 
our core product ranges and add custom 
injection moulding capability – as well as 
providing compelling cross-selling potential 
– it also extends our manufacturing 
footprint and gives us access to a number 
of high-growth end-markets in Mexico.
“Our strategic review 
has confirmed that 
the fundamental 
strengths exist across 
our businesses which 
we can build upon, 
and that previous 
challenges were 
caused by internal  
– not external – 
factors.”
Packaging
As one of only two multi-continental 
suppliers of a full range of specialist 
secondary health & personal care 
packaging, Essentra is fundamentally 
well-positioned in an attractive sector: 
underlying markets are stable and 
growing; we have a predominantly blue 
chip customer base which represents a 
high barrier to entry and exhibits a clear 
pattern of “one stop shop” purchasing, 
and industry trends support continuing 
growth and scope for value-added 
opportunities.
However, as mentioned above, through 
the poor integration of the acquisition  
of Clondalkin SPD, we lost much of our 
market share (through a reduced “share  
of wallet”) and customer trust over the 
course of 2016, further to which much of 
our recent focus has been on stabilising 
the business.
As part of the strategy review, and to 
create greater organisational clarity,  
we took the decision to carve out the 
tapes activities from the division and to 
run them as part of the newly-created 
Specialist Components division. In 
addition, low complexity packaging  
for consumer goods applications will  
be de-emphasised: notably, this 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
12
STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW unfortunately resulted in the closure of the 
financially and operationally-challenged 
Newport folding cartons site at the end  
of 2017 , and thus the removal of c. £4.5m 
losses in FY 2018.
As we continue to stabilise our underlying 
health & personal care packaging activities, 
we are now starting to leverage our core 
capabilities to drive revenue growth 
through initiatives such as additional 
commercial programmes to materially 
increase customer share of wallet, 
developing a broader and deeper service 
proposition and expanding geographically 
with existing customers. At the same time, 
the delivery of short-term profit levers  
– including procurement and process 
improvement initiatives, as well as the 
benefit from incremental investment in 
upgraded, more efficient equipment –  
are expected to help the division to start  
to improve towards an industry-average 
operating margin.
Filters
While Essentra’s addressed segments  
are fundamentally stable in an overall 
declining tobacco market – given our 
significant weighting towards special filters 
and Asia – there is scope to refine and 
distinguish the current proposition further, 
with the objective of both expanding the 
share of wallet with multi-nationals while 
simultaneously driving share among 
independent customers. In the case of  
the former, rebuilding global key account 
management and providing solutions in 
new geographic markets now demanding 
special filters should help us to strengthen 
and deepen customer relationships; 
regarding the latter, a more tailored offering 
and a better configuration of facilities  
can help to balance their demand for 
innovation with low-cost manufacturing.
Combined with further internal upgrading 
of our innovation capability to become  
a more commercially (rather than 
operationally) led business, and hence  
a more strategic partner, these initiatives 
– which are being led by our new divisional 
Managing Director, Kamal Taneja,  
who joined us in October – are aimed at 
improving customer and market visibility, 
and thereby dampening the historical 
volatility in the project pipeline.
Over and above optimising the existing 
business, we have identified three 
potential “game changers” and we are  
in the process of evaluating these further:
 > China – the world’s largest cigarette 
market (44% global volume) and 
currently served as an export market 
from our sites in Thailand and Indonesia. 
We are exploring a structural move into 
China, supported by our proven special 
filter capability, to capture the clear 
market trends toward premium and 
more international-style products
 > Greater outsourcing – a 1% shift in  
the outsourced filter share represents  
a c. £50m revenue increase to third-
party producers such as Essentra.  
With multi-national players continuing  
to pursue opportunities to rationalise  
their manufacturing footprint and  
to focus on core skills / improve asset 
utilisation, we are exploring the 
potential to help them simplify their 
supply chains through outsourcing a 
greater proportion of filter production
 > Next Generation Products (“NGP”) –  
currently a very small percentage of the 
overall tobacco market, however rapidly 
expanding as multi-nationals increasingly 
focus their innovation spend on both 
vaping (e-cigarette) and Heat Not  
Burn platforms. With a strong position  
in combustibles, and an expanding 
presence in both NGP segments, there  
is the possibility for us to grow in such 
emerging technologies
Given the early stage of evaluating each  
of these potential medium to long-term 
value-creating levers, these are not 
opportunities which we are assuming  
to be certain and we will update the 
financial markets accordingly as our 
analysis progresses.
Specialist Components
The newly-created Specialist Components 
division comprises Essentra’s six smaller 
business activities, which have very limited 
synergy with their previous larger “host” 
divisions and with each other. However,  
in their respective niches, most have 
strong (or at least reasonable) positions 
and all have scope for organic growth. 
Accounting for FY 2017 revenue of c. £164m 
– and with a (potentially variable) high 
single-digit adjusted operating margin  
in aggregate – these activities comprise 
Extrusion, Pipe Protection Technologies, 
Tear Tapes, Speciality Tapes, Industrial 
Supply (the Maintenance, Repair & 
Overhaul (“MRO”) industrial components 
business) and Card Solutions (Security).
We expect that this new organisational 
structure will facilitate faster, more nimble 
management, and that greater focus  
will enable more detailed strategic 
development: it will also give greater 
visibility on the performance of the three 
larger divisions. With effect from 1 January 
2018, Tim Wilson joined Essentra as 
divisional President and – over and  
above maximising short-term tactical 
opportunities – his task over the next six 
months will be to work with each of the 
respective business heads to formulate  
a full range of longer-term strategies.
The role of Finance …
As we have stabilised the Company,  
the Finance function has made a 
significant contribution in providing  
due control, discipline and balance sheet 
management, and will continue to do so  
as we seek to restore sustainable revenue 
growth and profitability to Essentra.  
In particular, the team has a critical role  
to play in terms of business partnering,  
as well as capturing the financial 
consequences of our corporate strategy 
and, hence, in informing the decision-
making process – both in terms of 
medium-term planning and in-year 
budgeting.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW “While there is 
limited synergy 
between our 
businesses, we have 
clearly defined a  
role for “the Group” 
to add value across  
a number of  
enabling functions  
– from Corporate 
Governance,  
Finance and HR, to 
Operations, IT, HSE 
and Commercial.”
Across our diverse businesses our 
manufacturing capability is a common 
theme and – having first started producing 
filters in the UK in the late 1940s – we have 
extensive expertise, from plastic injection 
moulding and extrusion to specialist 
printing / conversion and filtration 
technologies. In harnessing this significant 
capability, the Group has an important 
role to play in leveraging investment, 
sharing best practice to move our facilities 
to world class levels, taking advantage  
of common purchasing opportunities  
and standardising key processes where 
relevant. Alongside Operations, there  
are also opportunities to deliver critical 
process improvements, skill upgrades  
and cultural change in our Strategy & 
Commercial function, particularly with  
regard to driving corporate strategy, 
facilitating and challenging the next stage 
of divisional strategies and overseeing  
M&A activity and consistent post-merger 
integration protocols. As both areas will 
greatly benefit from central leadership and 
support, we have accordingly created two 
important Group Management Committee 
(“GMC”) roles in Group Operations Director 
and Strategy & Commercial Director.
Further to our review, we have revised  
our key financial performance indicators 
to focus on all value drivers, from both  
a profit & loss and balance sheet 
perspective. In the case of the former, 
operating profit growth and margin are 
now prioritised, while in the case of the 
latter there is an emphasis on working 
capital (measured as average working 
capital per month as a percentage of 
revenue), Property, Plant & Equipment  
and gearing: this translates into an 
increased focus on returns, both return  
on capital employed (ie, how we are using 
our balance sheet) and return on total 
invested capital (including accumulated 
goodwill etc from acquisition spend). 
From a financial perspective, the output  
of our review is a clear – and significantly 
enhanced – focus on cash flow generation; 
indeed, notwithstanding the afore-
mentioned incremental £30m capital 
expenditure, our objective is to improve 
our conversion ratio over the medium 
term, in particular through driving 
sustainable improvement in net  
working capital.
This focus on cash generation is evidenced 
in well-defined financial and capital 
allocation policies: these include a  
leverage target of between 1 – 2x net  
debt to EBITDA and a stretching internal 
return threshold for capital expenditure 
programmes, as well as a disciplined 
financial approach to acquisitions and  
a recognition of the importance of the 
dividend to shareholders while driving 
stability and growth. In addition, we  
have revised our management incentives  
to ensure due alignment, such that 
cash-related performance measures  
now account for 30% of the annual cash 
bonus and 20 - 40% of the Long-Term 
Incentive Programme.
… and of the wider “Group”
While there is limited synergy between our 
nine businesses in terms of end-markets 
and customers served, nonetheless there 
are a number of key aspects where “the 
Group” can add value. Indeed, over and 
above the role of Finance outlined above 
– together with Human Resources and 
Health and Safety (of which more below) 
– there are a number of other areas where 
a unifying central resource can significantly 
enhance the sum of our constituent parts 
and we are already making progress.
Not least among these is Corporate 
Governance and, consistent with the 
Board’s ongoing commitment to 
promoting a strong culture of the highest 
standards of business ethics based on 
clear principles, we now have an externally 
benchmarked and supported route to 
upper quartile FTSE 250 performance by 
2020. Together with the cultural change 
initiated during the year – which has seen 
a more committed “tone from the top” 
and the revision of a number of protocols 
– we have initiated a number of process 
improvements, including re-setting our risk 
management approach to develop consistent 
and relevant performance indicators, filling 
certain gaps in business continuity 
management and contract processes and 
revising our internal audit approach to add 
value and help drive positive change.
IT is also an area where we can benefit 
from an integrated approach, global 
infrastructure and co-ordinated activities. 
Indeed, the previous absence of corporate 
strategy, consistent standards and 
post-acquisition systems integration has 
resulted in a proliferation of platforms and 
installations relative to our site footprint, 
while historic under-investment means 
certain software is coming to the end of 
vendor support and we lack the necessary 
skills and number of resource for the 
relatively complex environment we have. 
The IT team, led by our new CIO, Richard 
Cammish, and supported by selective 
external expertise, has much to do to 
upgrade our capabilities – as well as to 
direct the continued investment being 
made to address the growing risks which  
all companies face in the cyber security 
domain – but is energised for change  
and the task in hand.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW People
At all levels, our employees are a vital 
resource in the Company’s pursuit of 
operational excellence and the provision  
of quality products and services to our 
customers. And, as Chief Executive,  
my priority is to provide a working 
environment which enables talent to 
flourish and where people believe  
they have the opportunity for career 
development.
Having introduced assessment-based 
Leadership Development Centres (“LDC”) 
in 2014, a total of 171 colleagues across all 
geographical regions have now attended 
the two key development programmes 
globally. Essentra’s LDC is not a traditional 
training programme; rather, it is designed 
to assess skills against defined Company 
leadership competencies which will be 
critical to our organisational success going 
forward. Together with their manager,  
the employee takes responsibility for using 
the output from the LDC to create a 
personal development plan with support 
from our Human Resources team. By 
being nominated to the LDC, employees 
have already delivered success consistently 
in their current role and demonstrated the 
potential for future advancement. As a 
result, the programme is designed to help 
employees fulfil their respective potential.
The Essentra Graduate Programme 
enjoyed further success in 2017 . The 
two-year programme has provided a 
talent pipeline for a number of years and,  
in 2017 , 25 people joined the scheme, 
which continues to expand its 
international reach. The 2017 intake will 
join the 19 graduates recruited in 2016, and 
will have the opportunity to develop their 
management skills through bespoke 
training which takes place around 
Essentra’s sites, giving graduates exposure  
to the business while carrying out an 
operational job from day one. Separately, 
in October, the 2015 graduate intake – 
who, for the first time had the opportunity 
to undertake some of their training in Asia 
in Bangalore, India – completed their 
programme, with a number of successful 
presentations hosted in Milton Keynes. 
Representatives from senior management 
were invited to watch the graduate teams 
drawn from across functions and 
geographies present on topics focusing  
on “Millennial Employee Engagement  
at Essentra”, “Should Essentra Improve  
its Employer Brand?” and “Knowledge 
Sharing: a Proposal for Implementation  
in Essentra Components” .
Additionally, in April, we announced our 
first National Apprenticeship Progamme  
in the UK. The programme launched 
across our sites at Bradford, Kidlington, 
Kilmarnock, Newmarket, Newport, 
Nottingham and Portsmouth, providing 20 
young apprentices the opportunity to learn 
skills in the printing, setting and finishing 
industries. Comprised of a selection of 
vocationally-recognised qualifications,  
as well as technical, functional and soft  
skills modules, the programme will take  
36 months to complete and provide 
participants with a Level 3 apprenticeship. 
With the average age of employees at our 
manufacturing sites increasing, we believe 
that such an initiative is an excellent way  
of attracting new talent to our business – 
particularly in skilled operational roles – and 
to offer them a rewarding and varied career .
Since joining, I have had the pleasure of 
visiting all our manufacturing sites and 
speaking to thousands of my colleagues, 
and what has consistently struck me is  
the incredible team we have and the 
extent of their knowledge, skill, passion 
and dedication to Essentra. Nowhere is 
this more evident than at our sites in 
Puerto Rico, where hurricane Maria caused 
devastation beyond anything most of us 
can imagine. While our experienced local 
team was well prepared for the hurricane 
strike, nonetheless the response of our 345 
employees at Manati and Guaynabo in 
reporting for work at a time when many  
of them were facing significant personal 
challenges was truly humbling, and the Board, 
GMC and I would like to pay tribute to their 
outstanding commitment to our business.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Health, safety and environment 
(“HSE”)
Nobody involved with our operations 
should suffer injury or harm, and  
Essentra’s commitment to achieving  
and maintaining the highest standards  
of occupational health and safety extends  
to our employees, temporary workers, 
contractors, customers, suppliers, visitors 
and members of the public alike. Our 
commitment also extends to our supply 
chain and to organisations working on  
our behalf, and we actively encourage  
our suppliers to operate in a similarly 
responsible manner.
Although we are still some way from the 
levels of excellence to which the Board  
and GMC are committed – and which are 
espoused in our updated Group HSE policy 
– we made progress in improving the HSE 
culture across the Group in 2017 . Indeed, 
although the number of Lost Time 
Incidents only modestly decreased versus 
2016, we saw a close to 20% reduction in 
days lost as a result of these incidents, 
indicating that the severity of the cases 
reported has notably lessened. In addition, 
we significantly invested in our global HSE 
capability during the year, to add resource 
and capability and to help identify and 
drive further improvements in performance 
and culture. This included the recruitment 
of a new Group HSE Director who – with 
his Global Safety Team, and with my and 
the GMC’s unstinting support – will be 
responsible for ensuring that this critical 
area remains at the forefront of the 
Company’s agenda, will take steps to reduce 
the number of accidents and incidents  
(with a goal of zero), will share learnings of 
safety investigations to prevent recurrence, 
and will encourage and facilitate employee 
participation and feedback to contribute  
to the high standards we have set ourselves. 
We will also expect employees to participate 
fully in the improvement of standards  
– not least site managers and supervisors – 
to ensure that healthy and safe working 
conditions are maintained within their 
sphere of influence at all times. 
Further to the disbanding of the matrix 
structure in February 2017 , in October we 
made further organisational changes in 
light of our strategic review. In particular, 
having restored stability to our activities, 
we created a global Health & Personal 
Care Packaging organisation – Essentra 
Packaging – with leadership under a  
single functional team. This has brought 
together our previous Europe & Asia and 
Americas regional organisations – which 
had been separately managed since 
February 2017 – and will allow us to serve 
our global customers better and with 
greater alignment, and to leverage our 
scale in innovation, best practice transfer 
and talent development. As a result, it  
will allow us to pursue a clear strategic 
direction with common purpose and to 
provide customers with a consistent global 
value proposition. Leading Essentra 
Packaging with effect from October is Iain 
Percival, who joined Essentra as Managing 
Director of the Europe & Asia business  
in March 2017; supporting Iain will be  
a number of senior global roles, which  
we have already made good progress  
in recruiting.
Following a year of challenge and change  
in 2016, we have much still to do to 
improve motivation and morale in certain 
parts of the organisation. This includes the 
Company being exemplary in all aspects 
of diversity and inclusion, and we have 
recently established a Steering Group to 
implement the agenda in these critical 
areas which form part of the cornerstone 
of our six principles. Accordingly, there is  
a significant role for our Group Human 
Resources team, from monitoring and 
reviewing the action plans from 
engagement surveys and further 
enhancing and managing our Learning & 
Development programmes, to continuing 
to lead the recruitment process for talent  
to fill skill gaps and benefiting from the 
addition of dedicated resource to expand 
our employee communications. Together 
with my GMC colleagues, I am committed 
to ensuring that Essentra is a great place 
to work, and to driving the engagement  
of our people from the lower quartile level 
which I inherited to our objective of  
upper quartile.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW As part of the cornerstone of our six 
principles, it is imperative that we give 
health and safety in the workplace our  
full focus and commitment, and I expect 
every one of us to participate fully in 
delivering our strategic and policy 
objectives in this area.
Essentra is additionally committed to  
the highest standards of corporate 
governance and responsibility, to ensure 
that the way in which we manage our 
activities reflects the expectations of  
all the Company’s stakeholders. As a 
member of both the FTSE4Good Index  
and the Carbon Trust, we recognise that 
careful stewardship of the environment  
is a duty we owe to our neighbours and  
to future generations, as well as a critical 
component of the international reputation 
and quality of Essentra’s businesses. 
All our principal manufacturing facilities 
hold the ISO 14001 environmental 
accreditation and, with the exception  
of recently acquired sites, they have also 
achieved the Occupational Health & 
Safety Management Systems OHSAS 
18001. Many of our operations are 
additionally required to adhere to more 
stringent standards, notably those serving 
the automotive and health & personal care 
sectors. During the year, our Barcelona, 
Spain Components site was accredited  
to IATF 16949, an updated and improved 
certification which ensures the facility 
meets the rigorous processes required  
to sell components to the automotive 
industry. Separately, we received PS9000 
certification across all our Health & 
Personal Care Packaging sites in the US  
and Puerto Rico, making Essentra the  
first manufacturer of secondary packaging 
in the region to secure this accreditation, 
and underscoring our commitment to 
Good Manufacturing Practice and  
“best in class” quality assurance to our 
pharmaceutical customers.
As part of our afore-mentioned updated 
HSE policy, we also committed to 
continuously improving our environmental 
performance. This includes preventing 
pollution and minimising emissions, 
discharges and disposals; reducing waste; 
specific energy consumption; and, where 
possible, conserving and recycling 
resources such as water – particularly  
in areas of scarcity. In addition, we have 
committed to actively engage with 
stakeholders to explore the opportunities 
offered by new technologies to improve our 
production processes and operations. 
Summary
Our roadmap from Stability, through to 
Strategy and Growth will take two to three 
years and, given the scale of the task, we 
will need to prioritise our objectives and 
may need to evolve our thinking over time. 
However, the vast majority of what we 
need to do is in our own hands, and we  
are already well on our way to rebuilding 
the foundations from which we can restore 
sustainable growth in our fantastic 
Company. We underwent a great deal  
of change in 2017 – which I know can be 
both exciting and unsettling – and I would 
like to thank all our employees for their 
collective hard work and commitment in 
this respect as, together, we seek to build  
a better Essentra.

“Restoring Essentra 
to sustainable, 
profitable growth is 
not a rapid journey, 
and we clearly have a 
lot of work still to do. 
However, together  
we have made great 
progress and tangible 
improvement in 2017 , 
so we are already 
well on our way.”
