 Record plc Annual Report 2017
Strategic report
6
Record is reporting growth in AUME, 
underlying revenues and underlying 
earnings. Whilst much of the growth in 
sterling terms can be attributed to sterling’s 
depreciation, it is also pleasing to note 
AUME growth in US dollar terms, taking 
AUME to its highest level in Record’s history.
The environment of political uncertainty 
and change, and the resultant significant 
moves in currency markets, have focused 
investors’ attention on the opportunities 
presented by currency management. 
We have seen inflows throughout the year 
in Hedging strategies and in Currency for 
Return, and we continue to see interest in 
a diversified range of opportunities amongst 
investors around the world.
The environment of political uncertainty and change 
creates opportunities for Record to demonstrate its 
full range of currency management skills.

Market overview
Financial markets have been dominated 
by political events in the year to 
31 March 2017, most notably the UK’s 
vote to leave the EU and the election 
of President Trump. Partly as a result, 
markets around the world have been 
slow to return to conventional interest 
rate policies, although the modest moves 
to higher US dollar rates have brought 
about some divergence. The net effect 
has included a marked depreciation of 
sterling over the financial year; the US dollar 
moved sideways in the first half of the year, 
before undergoing a notable rally following 
the election in November. The ongoing 
European election cycle brings with it the 
prospect of further market volatility as the 
question of sustainability of the EU, and by 
extension the euro, is revisited.
At the market structure level, differences 
have emerged between money market 
interest rates and those implied in foreign 
exchange forward contracts which have not 
generally been observed historically, as set 
out further on page 19. This creates relative 
winners and losers, as well as opportunities 
for Record’s clients. Regulation is one of 
the unintended drivers of this phenomenon. 
Other regulatory changes have required us 
to dedicate significant resources throughout 
the year to understanding the impact of 
such changes on each of our clients and 
engaging with clients to help them meet the 
new requirements.
Investment performance
UK-based Dynamic Hedging programmes 
allowed UK investors to capture gains in 
their underlying overseas exposures as 
sterling depreciated, by keeping hedge 
ratios low throughout the period.
US-based Dynamic Hedging clients saw 
losses from currency on international assets 
when valuing positions in US dollars, as the 
US dollar strengthened. Record’s Dynamic 
Hedging product increased hedge ratios 
in line with US dollar strength, though 
programmes experienced negative hedging 
returns overall due to the costs associated 
with varying the hedge ratios in the first half 
of the year, when the US dollar traded in a 
relatively narrow range.
All of Record’s Currency for Return 
strategies have performed positively in the 
period. Carry strategies yielded positive 
returns from all currency selections other 
than a short position in the Japanese yen, 
which ended the year up against higher 
interest rate currencies. In the case of 
Emerging Markets, positive returns were 
generated over the period as emerging 
market currencies generally appreciated 
against a basket of developed market 
currencies. Value performed markedly 
positively over the year, in part benefiting 
from long positions in the Japanese yen 
and the US dollar. Momentum generated 
positive returns through a short position in 
the pound.
Asset flows and 
financial performance
AUME
1
 increased by 10% in US dollar terms 
over the financial year to $58.2 billion, and 
by 26% in sterling terms to £46.6 billion 
– its highest ever level. There were net 
inflows of $3.2 billion in the year, with the 
majority coming from our Hedging products 
comprising Passive Hedging inflows of 
$2.5 billion and Dynamic Hedging inflows 
of $0.7 billion. There were also inflows to 
Currency for Return of $0.3 billion as our 
Multi-Strategy offering continued to gain 
interest from clients. Our Multi-product 
mandates had outflows of $0.4 billion. 
The aggregate impact of external factors 
(i.e. equity and other market movements 
and the impact of exchange rates over the 
period) was +$2.1 billion. Client numbers 
increased to 59.
Underlying revenues increased by 9% to 
£23.1 million. The increase was principally 
due to the impact of sterling weakness on 
the conversion of the 82% of management 
fees that are denominated in currencies 
other than sterling. Record’s costs before 
Group Profit Share remuneration grew by 
5%, most of which can be attributed to 
the office relocation which took place in 
November 2016. These factors combined 
with continued discipline in other cost areas 
allowed the Group to record an underlying 
operating margin of 34%, underlying 
profit before tax of £7.9 million, and basic 
earnings per share of 2.91 pence.

1. During the year ended 31 March 2017, Record introduced a new product category (“Multi-product”) in order to redefine the boundaries between existing products, 
and combinations of products, and redefined how AUME is measured for this new category. A full reconciliation of AUME under the new classification and the 
historic classifications is provided on page 103. All AUME data in the main body of this report is provided using the new classification basis.
2. The Group uses non-GAAP measures such as “underlying revenue” and “underlying operating profit”. These measures are calculated by removing the impact of 
non-controlling interests from the normal GAAP measures presented in the financial statements calculated in accordance with IFRS. The Group believes that these 
non-GAAP measures provide a useful indication of the performance of the business. Record plc Annual Report 2017

OFFICER’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
Client relationships
Our strategy of building trusted individual 
relationships with clients and their advisers 
remains unchanged. During the year 
we have seen the emergence of clearer 
themes amongst investors as to their 
preferences in managing currency risk 
and opportunity. In the US, currency 
risk management has risen higher on 
investors’ agendas with the rally in the 
US dollar and the recognition of the impact 
of political events on currency markets. 
Switzerland has long been a core market 
for Record, and we have increased the 
resources committed to this market with 
the opening of an office in Zürich since the 
financial year-end. In all markets the strong 
performance track record of Multi-Strategy 
is encouraging interest. The UK market is 
more challenging as sterling’s weakness 
has caused cash outflows from clients’ 
hedging programmes, and time and 
attention has to be focused on meeting 
regulatory requirements.
Innovation
Enhancement of existing products and 
development of new ones is a constant 
feature at Record, driven by clients’ 
needs and market opportunities. We have 
prioritised the expansion of our capabilities 
in cash and collateral management. The 
need to do so comes from a number of 
sources – legislation mandating variation 
margin for FX forwards, our plans to 
support a greater range of derivative 
overlays, and the opportunity to help 
clients suffering from low yields and 
growing  cash requirements. We have 
also continued to enhance our Passive 
Hedging offering, emphasising to clients 
its bespoke nature, and the opportunity 
to take advantage of market opportunities 
even within a fixed hedge ratio constraint. 
The range of exchange-traded funds 
offered by WisdomTree Investments, Inc. 
that track indexes using Record’s hedging 
signals has continued to grow and has 
won industry awards.
People
We have continued to attract, retain and 
develop high quality people, principally 
through intern programmes and graduate 
and early-stage career hires. We then focus 
on internal development and retention of 
these individuals. When recruiting staff 
early in their careers some subsequent 
attrition is inevitable, but this also creates 
a growing pool of alumni with whom we 
maintain strong relationships. We have 
largely succeeded in retaining key staff in 
a highly competitive employment market. 
The working environment for staff is part of 
the Group’s retention strategy, hence we 
have focused on the environment in our 
expanded office in Windsor, have moved 
our US office from Atlanta to New York, and 
have opened an office in Zürich since the 
end of the financial year. We are proposing 
changes to our remuneration structures 
including to conform conditions between 
Approved and Unapproved options and 
thereby enhance the alignment of interests 
with external shareholders.
Strategic progress
Record’s strategic progress over the year can be measured 
against each of the objectives set out on pages 10 and 11.

Outlook
From a diverse picture of investors’ 
preferences a year ago, clearer themes 
have now emerged. In particular, currency 
risk management has risen on US investors’ 
agendas, and we continue to commit 
significant resources to pursuing these 
opportunities. The strong performance of 
Multi-Strategy continues to attract investor 
interest. The Group has increasingly 
focused on its bespoke and differentiated 
approach to Passive Hedging when 
engaging with current and prospective 
clients and their advisers, and we continue 
to broaden our capabilities in cash and 
collateral management.
There is no evident end to political 
uncertainty and change, which creates 
opportunities for Record to demonstrate 
its full range of currency management 
skills to clients. All of Record’s management 
and staff remain focused on maintaining 
and enhancing our relationships with 
existing clients, as well as developing new 
client relationships and continuing to grow 
the business.

Growth
We have achieved growth in client 
numbers (58 to 59), AUME ($52.9 billion 
to $58.2 billion), management fees 
(£20.9 million to £22.7 million) and 
underlying revenues (£21.3 million to 
£23.1 million) over the period. We have 
deployed additional resources in 
North America and Switzerland and 
have sustained efforts in our other core 
markets of the United Kingdom and 
continental Europe. We continue to 
explore opportunities in other markets.
Profitability
The Group’s underlying profitability has 
increased. Underlying profit before tax 
increased from £7.0 million to £7.9 million 
over the period. Revenues benefited from 
improved conversion rates for revenues 
denominated in currencies other than 
sterling. The underlying operating margin 
has increased to 34%.
Risk management
The Group takes a proactive approach 
to developing its systems, people 
and processes, in order to improve 
management of the operational risk 
that we assume from clients and 
to meet the demands of emerging 
regulatory requirements. We have 
implemented new systems to support 
our collateral management function and 
have developed a new system to improve 
our exposure capture and rebalancing 
processes for Hedging mandates. We have 
continued to invest in our cyber-security 
defences. The Group has committed 
resources to prepare for the implementation 
of MiFID II, and to manage the effects of 
the UK exiting the European Union. Record 
is well placed to manage the risks arising 
from these events and will continue to keep 
developments under review.
