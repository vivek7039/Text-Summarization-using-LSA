 Chief Executive’s Overview
Good progress
This has been a positive year for Yorkshire Water and its 
customers as we continue to make good progress towards 
the delivery of our five-year business plan for the period 2015 
to 2020. Our focus has continued to be on the affordable, 
efficient and safe delivery of excellent customer services,  
while fulfilling our environmental and social responsibilities.
I would like to pay tribute to our colleagues who continue 
to demonstrate great skill and diligence. As well as their 
day-to-day duties, many colleagues have also been involved 
in implementation of major new change initiatives, including 
wholesale upgrades to the Company’s information technology 
and work management systems. Our colleagues have shown 
a real willingness to change to provide a more effective and 
efficient service, with colleague satisfaction remaining 
high at 78%.
Being awarded a maximum five stars in Business in The 
Community’s Corporate Responsibility Index is a positive 
indication that we are striking the right balance between  
the demands of our many stakeholders as well as the  
needs of both the short and long-term.
Demonstrating resilience
Despite our strong performance, we are not complacent. 
Our commitments and ambitions get more stretching over 
the remainder of the current Asset Management Period (AMP) 
and the resilience of our business continues to be tested 
frequently. I am proud to say the Company and colleagues 
have responded well to the challenges presented in 2016/17.
For example, following the floods of late 2015 we have 
continued to make excellent progress towards recovering 
the pipes, pumping stations and treatment works that were 
damaged by the winter deluge. The flooding contributed to 
a reduction in compliance with our waste water treatment 
works discharge permits down from 99.32% to 97.61%.
In addition, flood damage to our thermal hydrolysis plant in 
Bradford caused us to miss our Performance Commitment 
for renewable energy generation. I am pleased to report that 
the plant is now performing well and we expect to meet our 
future energy generation targets, and exceed them by 2020.
We have gone beyond the simple recovery of our assets. In 
February, we announced a new natural flood management 
plan for the Calder Valley where various flood management 
initiatives will be implemented over the next ten years, 
including the planting of 200,000 trees to ‘slow the flow’  
from moorland catchments above Gorpley Reservoir.  
This forms part of a multi-agency response to the flooding 
issues faced by local communities.
Collaboration has always been, and remains, a key part of 
the Company’s values and we are working closely with local 
councils, the Environment Agency, community groups and 
conservationists to implement this innovative work.
In July 2016, the actions of a third party led to the 
contamination of water supplies in Thorne, near Doncaster. 
Thanks to the efforts of our field team, supplies were quickly 
returned to normal, with immediate action taken to protect 
customer safety. Legal action has been undertaken against 
the third party and measures have been taken to prevent 
reoccurrence. The Drinking Water Inspectorate praised our 
‘swift’ response and willingness to share our learnings with 
other UK water companies.
While drinking water quality within Yorkshire remained 
excellent with 99.962% of hundreds of thousands of  
samples meeting stringent regulatory standards, we  
missed our stretching Performance Commitment for the 
number of customer contacts regarding water quality.
We achieved our Performance Commitment for pollution 
incidents in 2016/17, continuing the long-term trend of 
reducing the number of ‘serious’ (Category 1 and 2) pollution 
incidents caused by our assets or operations. However, we 
were also fined during the year for two pollution incidents 
that occurred in 2013. These fines served to reinforce our 
environmental responsibilities, as well as our need for constant 
vigilance and excellent asset and operational management.
We are also continuing to ensure the long-term financial 
resilience of our business. I am pleased that we have reduced 
gearing levels and continued to implement our new plans to 
manage our portfolio of index-linked swaps.
Building trust
During the remainder of this report we provide a detailed 
breakdown of all key aspects of our performance for the year 
2016/17 and how we’re performing against our longer-term 
Strategic Business Objectives.
It is important to us that our customers and stakeholders 
can trust the information we publish, which is why we were 
extremely disappointed to be placed in the lower ‘prescribed’ 
category by Ofwat in the latest assessment under their 
Company Monitoring Framework. In response, we have 
consulted with our customers on a new assurance plan which 
was published in early 2017. We have also carried out a major 
review of the governance, quality and assurance of all our 
regulatory and corporate reports, with a view to improving 
their availability and accessibility.
You’ll see improvements in this publication and our 
other reporting.
We remain committed to being an open, honest 
and transparent company.
