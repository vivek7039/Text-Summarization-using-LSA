 Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 4
Chairman’s statement
2017 results
The Group’s performance in 2017 was ahead 
of our original expectations, driven by a 
strong performance from Everyday Loans 
and also by a sharp uplift at Loans at Home 
which benefited from operational 
challenges at a major competitor. It also 
includes a maiden contribution from George 
Banco whose results were consolidated from 
the middle of August 2017.
Reported revenues were £107.8m (2016: 
£72.8m) and the Group produced an 
operating profit of £3.8m (2016: operating 
loss of £5.2m). Higher interest costs and the 
impact of exceptional charges resulted in a 
reported loss per share of 3.26p (2016: loss 
per share of 2.60p).
On a normalised basis and excluding 
temporary additional commission, the 
Group’s underlying performance was strong, 
delivering a 35% increase in pre-tax profit to 
£16.4m (2016: £12.1m) and earnings per share 
of 4.25p (2016: 3.09p).
Strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged. We 
remain focused on serving the needs of 
consumers who are unable or unwilling to 
borrow from mainstream institutions through 
three distinct business divisions: branch-
based lending, home credit and guarantor 
loans. Each of these segments offers 
significant opportunity for growth and 
having already achieved our target of 20% 
loan book growth across the Group as a 
whole, we remain on course to also deliver a 
20% return on assets in each of our 
operating divisions. This will be achieved 
through the execution of the three elements 
of our business strategy:
• Being a leader in our chosen markets; 
• Investing in our core assets; and 
• Acting responsibly. 
Each of these is explained in more detail in 
the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 53.
Management
During 2017 we made a number of changes to 
the senior management in each of our three 
business divisions. These changes resulted in a 
marked increase in both ambition and pace of 
execution – a combination that is feeding 
through into enhanced operational and 
financial performance. 
As Everyday Loans accounts for over half 
our business, we appointed one of our 
founding Directors, Miles Cresswell-Turner, 
to lead the business in May 2017. Davie 
Thompson became CEO of Loans at Home 
in January 2017 and brings over 30 years’ 
experience in the home credit industry, 18 of 
which were working with John van Kuffeler. 
Marc Howells, the Managing Director of 
George Banco, became CEO of our newly 
formed Guarantor Loans Division 
comprising both George Banco and 
TrustTwo in September 2017. 
As a Board, we have long recognised the 
value of strong leadership, not just in helping 
to achieve short-term goals but also in 
shaping the culture and long-term potential 
of each of our business divisions. 
Culture
In last year’s Annual Report I set out the 
process that we had initiated to identify the 
core elements that underpin the culture of 
each of our businesses and the target 
behaviours that we believe will enable us to 
succeed. This effort continued throughout 
2017 and thanks to the drive and 
determination of our new business leaders, 
we have been able to refine and start to 
embed these values across the Group as 
part of our appraisal and reward process. 
 
A year  
of progress
2017 was another year of 
substantial progress for the 
Group. We delivered strong loan 
book growth in all three business 
divisions whilst the overall rate of 
impairment declined. We also 
completed the acquisition of 
George Banco for an enterprise 
value of approximately £53.5m 
and more than doubled our 
committed debt facilities to 
£260m. Having delivered overall 
loan book growth of more than 
20% in 2017 , we remain on course 
to also achieve a 20% return on 
assets in each of our three divisions.  Corporate Governance Financial Statements

Strategic Report Overview
Employee engagement is a key measure that 
we monitor closely to determine how 
effectively we are promoting these values 
and to confirm that we are upholding the 
high standards we expect. During 2017 we 
hosted a series of management conferences 
and also launched a Group-wide intranet. 
This is proving popular among staff as a 
source of the latest Company news as well 
as a repository for useful documents and 
procedures. An abridged version of the 
intranet is also available to all of our 
self-employed agents that represent an 
important stakeholder group. Our latest 
internal surveys show that our people are 
well-engaged and, whilst not complacent, 
we are pleased with the progress made so 
far (see the survey results on page 35).
Effective reporting systems and controls help 
the Board to manage and mitigate risk, but 
cannot eliminate it altogether. Throughout 
2017 the Board received regular updates 
from each of the operational management 
teams and also made a number of site visits 
to operations around the country, spending 
time with staff, self-employed agents and 
customers. In addition, my three executive 
colleagues visited our front-line operations 
on a regular and sometimes weekly basis. 
Hearing first-hand about operational issues 
and how they are impacting the experience 
of our customers helps us to refine our 
operations and strategic priorities.
Regulation
Each of our businesses is fully licensed by the 
FCA and we remain supportive of their efforts 
to maintain a rigorous regulatory framework, 
ensuring the protection of consumers, effective 
competition and a well-functioning market. 
We also welcome their recent High-Cost 
Credit Review Update in which they note:
“Consumers can benefit from using high-cost 
credit where repayments are sustainable and 
appropriate forbearance is shown if they have 
temporary repayment problems.” 
1
Whilst supportive of the FCA’s objectives, 
we believe that any potential gains from 
additional regulation must always be 
measured against the cost of achieving them. 
As well as executing the sometimes significant 
changes required of firms as part of the FCA’s 
licensing process, there has also been a near 
continuous flow of consultations, in-depth 
research and proposed regulatory changes 
that regulated firms have to address (see ‘An 
evolving regulatory landscape’ on page 28). 
Even for well-capitalised groups such as NSF , 
this adds significantly to both the regulatory 
burden and the uncertainty of managing a 
business in an ever-shifting regulatory 
landscape. Smaller firms may be less 
well-placed to meet these demands and may 
look to exit the market, resulting in less choice 
for customers.
We are pleased that the FCA appears to have 
no major concerns regarding branch-based 
lending or guarantor loans. In home credit 
however, the FCA has said that it may look to 
introduce measures that it believes will reduce 
the risk of harm and/or consumer detriment. 
However, we do not believe it has provided 
any clear evidence that such harm or 
detriment exists in the home credit market. 
In fact, we would argue that the contrary is 
true: customer complaints are low, customer 
satisfaction is high and the very design of the 
home credit product means that the risk of 
customer detriment or financial distress from 
late payment is low. 
We continue to engage actively with the FCA, 
on a number of levels, both directly as well as 
through industry associations. We are 
determined to demonstrate the important 
service that home credit provides to over a 
million UK consumers, for whom mainstream 
credit may be either out of reach or less suited 
to their needs.
Board
We were delighted to welcome Niall Booker  
to join the Board as an independent Non-
Executive Director in May 2017 . Niall has 
brought a wealth of experience from his time 
at HSBC, Household and more recently 
Co-operative Bank where he was CEO until 
December 2016.
Final dividend
Having declared a half-year dividend of 0.50p 
per share in August 2017 , the Board is pleased 
to recommend a final dividend of 1.70p per 
share (2016: 0.9p), making a total of 2.20p for 
the year as a whole (2016: 1.20p). If approved 
by shareholders, this final dividend would 
mean that we had reached our target of a 
payout ratio of at least 50% of 2017 normalised 
post-tax earnings, before temporary 
additional commission. If approved at the 
AGM, the final dividend would be paid to 
those shareholders on the Company’s share 
register on 18 May 2018, with payment being 
made on 15 June 2018.
Outlook
Each of our three business divisions has 
excellent growth prospects and is a top 
three player in its individual market 
segment. Each is led by a highly 
experienced management team and has 
the potential to deliver a 20% return on 
assets before central costs. With £260m of 
committed debt facilities in place, we are 
well-funded and we are optimistic about 
the Group’s prospects.

Our values:
• Doing the right thing: we recognise 
our collective responsibility for 
delivering great outcomes – not just 
for our customers but also our other 
stakeholders. We don’t cut corners 
and always seek the path that is 
right before the path that is easy. 
• Integrity: we expect our people to 
respect colleagues and other key 
stakeholders and to do what we  
say we will do. 
• Shared purpose delivered through 
teamwork: we have clear strategic 
and operational goals and expect 
all of our people to understand and 
share in that vision. Our businesses 
are complex, combining many 
different elements to achieve our 
overall objectives. By working 
together we are likely to solve 
problems more effectively than 
trying to do things on our own. 
• Clear communication: we listen 
carefully to those dealing directly 
with our customers; we are well-
informed and believe it’s our duty  
to speak up when we disagree, or 
believe something is not right; we 
celebrate success and don’t blame 
others when something goes wrong, 
always learning from our mistakes. 
• Entrepreneurial leadership: we lead 
by example, using our initiative and 
not just waiting to be told what to 
do; knowledgeable and inquisitive, 
we are prepared to try new things 
so we can perform better and be the 
best we can be.
