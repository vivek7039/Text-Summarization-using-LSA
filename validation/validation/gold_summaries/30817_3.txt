Chairman’ s 
Statement
2017 was another successful year  
for the Group. 
The US B&GA market grew strongly during the year and we have 
continued to lay the foundations for further growth and value 
creation across the Signature network through investing in our 
infrastructure and customer offer and successfully negotiating 
revised commercial terms with many of our customers.
We made further investments in Ontic’s IP-protected licence 
portfolio in 2017 and the business performed very strongly, with 
good contributions from new licences and growth from military 
parts programmes. There was a much improved operating 
performance at ERO despite challenging markets. 
During the year we undertook a comprehensive review of BBA 
Aviation’s capital structure and, as a result, have increased our 
targeted leverage range. This enables us to maintain a capital 
efficient balance sheet, based on the strong and robust cash flow 
fundamentals of the Group, and provides us with the flexibility 
required to meet investment opportunities to fund organic and 
inorganic growth and enhance shareholder value.
Results
Continuing Group revenue increased by 10% to $2,370.6 million. 
Flight Support revenue was up 13.8% and Aftermarket Services 
revenue grew 3.1%, driven by Ontic which offset the decline at ERO. 
Continuing Group underlying operating profit was $360.6 million 
(2016: $302.6 million) and continuing Group underlying operating 
profit margin increased to 15.2% (2016: 14.1%) reflecting underlying 
margin growth at both Flight Support and Aftermarket Services.
Underlying continuing profit before tax increased to $298.5 million  
(2016: $238.7 million) and adjusted continuing underlying EPS was  
up 24% to 24.0¢. We delivered free cash flow of $220.6 million  
(2016: $224.1 million) and, as a result, the Group de-levered to  
2.6x net debt to underlying EBITDA on a covenant basis. Return on 
invested capital (ROIC) was up 90 basis points to 11.0% (2016: 10.1%).
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 9.59¢ per share, taking 
the full year dividend to 13.40¢, an increase of 5%. This reflects the 
Board’s progressive dividend policy and its continued confidence in 
BBA Aviation’s future prospects. 
Sir Nigel Rudd,
Chairman
The Board
On 2 January 2018 we were delighted to announce that Mark Johnstone 
will join the Board as Group Chief Executive on 1 April 2018. Mark has a 
deep understanding of the Group and the right strategic and operational 
experience, having held a number of senior roles at BBA Aviation over the 
last ten years. Mark takes over from Wayne Edmunds, who stepped into 
the role on an interim basis on the departure of Simon Pryce in June 2017 . 
I would like to thank Wayne and Simon for their respective contributions. 
Simon led BBA Aviation for a significant period and played a key role in 
managing the Group through the downturn and in the transformation 
that has taken place in recent years. Wayne will continue to be a member 
of the Board but will not be regarded as an independent director and will 
not be a member of Board Committees. David Crook joined the Board 
as Group Finance Director on 1 June 2017 , replacing Mike Powell.
On 1 January 2018 we welcomed two new non-executive directors, Amee 
Chande and Emma Gilthorpe, to the Board. Amee and Emma bring highly 
relevant experience for the next stage of the Group’s development and I 
look forward to working with them. We also announced that Peter Ratcliffe 
will step down from the Board at the 2018 AGM. I would like to thank Peter 
for his valuable contribution to the Board over the past nine years and 
thank each of our non-executive directors for their counsel during the year.
Outlook
The Board is pleased with the performance of the Group and progress 
made in 2017 . We have started to capture the value of Signature’s 
unique network and Ontic is performing very well. ERO has stabilised 
and we have recently commenced a strategic review of this business. 
We have also ensured that we have an appropriate capital structure going 
forward. Recent investments at Signature are all focused on delivering 
continued market outperformance in terms of our earnings growth. 
We will continue to look to expand our FBO network and our offering 
of non-fuel services to ensure that we remain the market leader with 
unmatched customer relevance. Our growing portfolio at Ontic offers 
significant opportunities and the business has a strong pipeline. The 
Board remains confident of good growth in 2018.
