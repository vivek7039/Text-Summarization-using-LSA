 2017 was a very productive year  
in which all of our businesses made 
significant progress and delivered  
an excellent set of group results.  
With over 60% of our sales and profits 
now generated outside the UK, the 
headline results benefited from sterling 
weakness on translation. Nevertheless, 
growth was very strong on a constant 
currency basis with revenue and 
adjusted operating profit ahead by  
6% and 13% respectively.
Over the last few years AB Sugar  
has taken major steps to transform  
its business with the sale of the cane 
sugar operations in south China this year, 
the move to full ownership of Illovo last 
year and the benefits delivered by the 
performance improvement programme 
over many years. It is pleasing to report  
a substantial increase in Sugar profit this 
year which benefited from all of these 
initiatives and an increase in EU sugar 
prices. Illovo is making good progress 
with its accelerated programme of 
commercial development and the delivery 
of further production efficiencies. In the 
EU, we have established a low cost 
business which is positioned to exploit 
the market opportunities and associated 
freedom to export, following the abolition 
of sugar quotas in October this year.
In Grocery, Twinings Ovaltine, ACH in the 
US and George Weston Foods in Australia 
all increased adjusted operating profit. 
However, a difficult trading environment 
in the UK bread market led to a decline  
in revenues at Allied Bakeries and it 
sustained a loss. We are continuing to 
invest in our brands and are working 
closely with our customers to improve 
the profitability of our bakery business. 
AB Agri continued with its strategy of 
expanding the value-adding elements  
of its business. Ingredients achieved 
another strong profit and margin increase 
driven by further cost reduction in  
AB Mauri and excellent performances 
from speciality ingredients.
The expansion of Primark’s selling space 
continued apace this year and trading 
was excellent, particularly over the 
summer, delivering strong increases  
in market share. Our determination to  
be the best value on the high street 
drove the decision not to pass on to our 
customers the higher input costs arising 
from sterling weakness against the  
US dollar. The gross impact of this on 
Primark’s margin was, to some extent, 
mitigated by the work of the buying

and merchandising teams and margin 
declined by less than expected at  
the beginning of the year to 10.4%. 
Notwithstanding this highly successful 
year, Primark constantly seeks better 
ways of delivering value to customers, 
be that through store design and 
location, stock availability, or enhancing 
its reputation for on-trend fashion.  
The Primark website and social media 
are playing an ever more important role 
in the relationship with our customers  
in driving awareness of our products  
and footfall in our stores. Primark will 
continue to expand its selling space 
across all its countries of operation with 
another strong programme of new store 
openings scheduled for the coming year.
Implications of the EU referendum
The consequences for the group of the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU should  
be seen in the context of the diversity  
of our operations and geographical 
footprint, combined with a business 
model that has discrete Primark supply 
chains for the UK and Eurozone and, 
wherever possible, aligns food production 
with the end markets for our products. 
Changes in legislation and trade 
agreements provide significant 
opportunities for the food industry to 
replace imported food and build export 
markets and, for UK agricultural policy 
particularly, they have the potential  
to benefit our group. We are engaged  
at all levels with a number of UK 
Government departments to ensure  
that the full range of opportunities and 
risks, as they affect us, are recognised.
We are pleased with the Government’s 
commitment that least developed 
countries will not face an increase in 
tariffs on their exports to the UK after it 
leaves the EU. This will provide benefits 
both for UK consumers and trade  
with these countries which plays an 
important part in securing the livelihoods 
of local workforces. In common with 
many other businesses, we share a 
concern about the risk of abrupt changes 
to the UK’s customs procedures. We 
therefore welcome the Government’s 
intention to have a transition period 
beyond March 2019 in which to 
implement the necessary systems  
and processes.
