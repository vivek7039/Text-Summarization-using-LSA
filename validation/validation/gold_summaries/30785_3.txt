 Chairman’s statement
“ We continue to take a long-term approach 
to how we run the business, reflected by 
the well-established leadership team that 
thoroughly understands the strategy and 
operational workings of the business. 
As leaders in our core markets, we will 
continue to innovate and demonstrate 
our value for money proposition. ”
Bob Holt
Chairman
While it has been a challenging year, I am pleased to 
report a year of operational progress and that the 
Group is very well positioned to benefit as our core 
markets continue to develop. During the year, Housing 
and Care have been at the top of the political agenda 
and we believe our differentiated offering has never 
been more relevant. The events seen in the wider 
outsourcing sector have been frustrating, where 
company-specific issues have been perceived to 
have wider sector implications. We have, over recent 
months, needed to remind stakeholders of how 
Mears is different from the competition. 
Mears is a very simple business. Our focus has always been 
on a single service user, namely the individual in their home. 
Whilst the end service users are at the centre of our business 
model, the services themselves are primarily funded by the 
public sector . The benefit of having this narrow focus is that we 
understand our markets, we understand the challenges faced 
by our clients and we are well placed to provide innovative 
solutions to address those challenges. We have a strict and 
continuing discipline when bidding new contract opportunities: 
we are highly selective and we never change our bidding model 
to meet a short-term growth aspiration. This has been most 
evident recently where we have seen a lower rate than normal in 
the conversion of new contract opportunities. However, I remain 
extremely confident in the quality of our tender submissions. 
We have missed some opportunities on price, having scored 
well on all the quality measures. We are very confident that 
our conversion rate over the medium term will continue to be 
in line with our historical norms. We will continue to take a 
long-term approach to how we run the business, reflected 
in the well-established leadership team that thoroughly 
understands the strategy and operational workings of the 
business. As leaders in our core markets, we will continue to 
innovate and demonstrate our value for money proposition.
Our strategic priorities 
are the building blocks 
of our business
  See them on page 16
Summary
 → We have a strict and continuing discipline when bidding 
new contract opportunities. We remain highly selective, 
and we will never change our bidding model to meet any 
short-term growth aspiration. 
 → We have reassessed how we guide our investors and city 
analysts. We will set our expectations for the next twelve 
months in line with our “firm and probable” order book, 
providing updates to those expectations when new orders 
are secured. 
 → The Board remains confident in the future opportunities 
and consequently it expects to continue following a 
progressive dividend policy. 
 → I was delighted to see exceptional response rates in our 
‘Say what you see’ survey across our 12,000 employees, 
which showed continued improvement from the already 
good levels achieved in 2016. 
 → We are looking to appoint an employee director to the 
Board to ensure that the Board gets full, open and 
honest insight and views from its workforce on how 
strategic initiatives are being implemented.

I am satisfied with the financial performance for the year to 
31 December 2017, but I am also mindful that our financial 
results were short of our aspirations at the start of the year. 
While our focus is on sustainable growth in the medium to 
long term, I understand the importance of delivering against 
our financial targets in the short term too. The tragic events 
of Grenfell Tower, and the resulting impact on our Housing 
revenues, could not have been anticipated. Group revenue was 
£900.2m (2016: £940.1m). Our second half revenues of £429.4m 
(2016: £473.9m) showed a significant reduction versus those 
delivered in the first half of £470.8m (2016: £466.2m) 
reflecting the delays in the timing of our planned workload 
as clients’ attentions was diverted towards ensuring that 
their housing portfolios were safe and fully compliant. 
We supported our clients in postponing this planned work, 
knowing that it will return once they have confirmed their 
housing is fully compliant. The revenue reduction, together 
with the associated impact upon overhead recovery , saw Group 
profit before tax and before acquired intangible amortisation 
reduce by 7% to £37.1m (2016: £40.1m) and a margin of 4.1% 
(2016: 4.3%). Normalised diluted earnings mirrored the profit 
reduction, decreasing by 8% to 28.05p (2016: 30.36p). Our 
performance by operating division is discussed in greater 
detail in the Review of operations.
The Group reacted quickly to the reduction in Housing revenues. 
Whilst the reduction is expected to be temporary given the 
contractual nature of the work, it has prompted the Group 
to carry out a more detailed review of its operational and 
central support structures to ensure that they deliver the best 
value. This is particularly relevant given the evolution towards 
a broader service offering with a changing support requirement. 
The Board expects annual savings in excess of £5m to be 
delivered in the 2018 financial year.
The order book is £2.6 billion (2016: £3.1 billion), reflecting the 
quiet period of new contract awards. Previously , Mears has 
reported secured revenue as a key performance metric. Due 
to the evolving nature of our business, secured revenue over 
recent years has been found to be a less robust metric than it 
was historically. This became increasingly evident following 
the challenges encountered in 2017, where secured revenues 
reduced over the course of the year. The Board has reassessed 
how we guide the market and, going forward, we will set our 
expectations for the next twelve months in line with our 
‘firm and probable order book’ , providing market updates to 
those expectations when new orders are secured whilst also 
giving us an increased ability to absorb unforeseen 
challenges. The ‘firm and probable order book’ for 
2018 currently stands at £900m. 
The Group has positioned itself to provide a broader service 
offering to the increasingly complex challenges faced by our 
clients. The pipeline of traditional contracting opportunities 
continues to flow through at a consistent level and the 
innovative nature of our Housing Management solutions 
means that much of that work can be secured without the 
requirement for an extended, competitive and expensive 
tender process. Moreover, I do wish to highlight that the 
Group is currently working on two opportunities that are very 
significant and, until recently , would have been beyond the 
reach of the Group. While significantly bigger in scale than the 
Group’s previous bids, they remain true to our core approach of 
focusing on services around a tenant, funded by public money .
We continue to have good dialogue with our shareholders and 
one topic which prompts discussion more than any other is in 
respect of our Care activities. We need to communicate more 
clearly the fundamental role played by Care within our 
Housing business, and the extent to which it underpins the 
success of that part of the Group. We do see an increasing 
number of opportunities where clients are seeking a seamless 
service to provide both care and housing to vulnerable people. 
The Group will increasingly focus its Care bidding activity 
towards those clients where there are opportunities to provide 
Housing services. The Board remains aware of its obligations 
to shareholders, and it will continue to target better returns 
from the Care business. A particular highlight for me was 
the significant improvement in the performance of the Care 
division which returned to profitability in the second half of 2017.
Dividend
The Board remains confident in the Group ’ s future opportunities 
and consequently it expects to continue following a progressive 
dividend policy. The Board is therefore recommending a final 
dividend of 8.55p (2016: 8.40p) per share which, when 
combined with the interim dividend, gives a total dividend for 
the year of 12.00p (2016: 11.70p), a 3% increase, reflecting the 
Board’s confidence in the underlying performance of the 
Group. The dividend is payable, subject to shareholder approval, 
on 5 July 2018 to shareholders on the register on 15 June 2018. 
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s dividend policy to 
maximise returns to shareholders whilst maintaining a prudent 
capital structure and retaining the ability to invest for growth.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Our people
During the second half year, the Group carried out its annual 
staff survey, ‘Say What You See’ . I was delighted to see an 
exceptional response rate of 83% across our 12,000 employees 
which is all the more pleasing considering much of the Mears 
workforce is mobile and therefore engagement is naturally 
harder. Staff feedback showed continued improvement 
from the already good levels in 2016. Areas that scored 
particularly highly in the survey were our commitment to 
customer service and to people development, both of which 
are fundamental to delivering our strategic priorities. 
I commend our employees for their commitment and energy 
throughout a challenging period for the Group and I continue 
to be impressed by their quality, professionalism and loyalty. 
Mears has a diverse workforce including several hundred 
apprentices. The vast majority of our employees live in the 
areas in which they work. Diversity and respect for all  
remains core to our induction, recruitment and customer 
care programmes.
Corporate governance and risk management
During the year, a number of our Non-Executive Directors 
reached nine years’ service and did not therefore offer 
themselves for re-election. Accordingly , the Board was delighted 
to welcome Roy Irwin and Jason Burt as Non-Executive 
Directors, whose appointments were confirmed at the 2017 
AGM. Both Roy and Jason have brought skills and experience 
that have added considerably to the Board. I was also 
delighted to welcome Elizabeth Corrado to the Board in 
September 2017 who further enhanced the breadth of 
skills and balance of the Board.
Peter Dicks will not be offering himself for re-election at the 
2018 AGM and will step down from the Board in June 2018. 
I would like to thank Peter for the significant contribution 
that he has made to the Group. 
The Board continues to set itself high standards of corporate 
governance. Our Corporate Governance Report, issued within 
our Annual Report, details how we approach governance and 
the areas of focus for the Board in 2017 and into the future.  
In line with good practice, we have reviewed and updated the 
Group’s risk register. The Senior Management Team plays a 
central role in reviewing and mitigating the Group’s risks. 
The Group risk team presented risk management training 
modules to all levels of management via the Group 
development programme, to reinforce our strong risk 
management ethos.
Board evaluation and effectiveness
Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees 
and individual Directors takes place on an annual basis. An 
externally facilitated performance evaluation was conducted 
during the year covering a broad range of areas including Group 
strategy, independence, experience and effectiveness and the 
interaction between Board members. It confirmed that the 
Board is functioning well. It is vital that as a Board we have the 
right mix of skills, experience and diversity, whilst ensuring that 
Board members have sufficient knowledge of the Company and 
maintain their independence and objectivity . I am fortunate as 
Chairman to be able to call upon a Board with a broad range of 
expertise and specialist knowledge.
Employee Director
We understand the vital role that our workforce plays in 
the success of the Group. To further increase engagement 
between the Board and our employees, we are looking to 
appoint an Employee Director to the Board. This role will 
ensure that the Board receives full, open and honest insight 
and views from its workforce on how strategic initiatives 
are being implemented and will provide the wider workforce 
with a better understanding of how the Board operates. 
We are currently managing the recruitment process, with 
applications open to all employees. The role will be restricted 
to a two-year term and we hope that the appointment of the 
successful applicant will be confirmed at the 2018 AGM.
Gender pay
Mears will shortly be issuing its first report based on the  
UK’s new gender pay reporting requirements.
Mears’ gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the salaries 
and gender makeup of its Care division, which accounts for 
around two thirds of employees. The Care division is 
predominantly female and within a sector which is poorly 
funded, with many of employees paid at levels tracking the 
National Living Wage. The Housing division comprising the 
remaining one third of employees, is predominantly male. 
The Housing sector is significantly better funded and pay 
rates reflect this. We are determined to continue to lead the 
way in encouraging more women to pursue a career in housing 
and indeed take every opportunity to highlight the need for 
Central Government and Local Authorities to raise the 
funding and status of roles in the Care sector.
Social value
At the heart of Mears lies a strong sense of responsibility 
towards improving peoples' lives. We aim to lead the way 
with social value in the markets where we operate, delivering 
lasting and meaningful outcomes. During the year we conducted a 
review of our social value strategy , identifying our key priorities to 
ensure that we effectively engage with communities and 
deliver social value on the ground throughout the business, 
with an effective measurement of the social impact that 
is created.
We continued to secure Social Mobility Champion status from 
the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. 
Social mobility is about creating opportunities for young 
people from disadvantaged backgrounds. At Mears, we aim 
to make sure jobs and opportunities are open to everyone.
Summary
From a personal perspective, I am incredibly proud of the 
progress the Group has made since its IPO in 1996. Our revenues 
have grown from £10m to £900m, a significant part of which 
has been delivered organically. Profits have grown from a few 
hundred thousand pounds to tens of millions. We employ 
around 12,000 people and support wider stakeholders in the 
communities where we operate. These achievements should 
not be forgotten in what has been a difficult political and 
trading environment. We will continue to play a leading role 
in shaping our core markets. The Executive team has an 
outstanding track record and I am proud to be associated 
with the Group. I look forward to reporting on further 
progress during the coming year.
