Chief Executive’s Statement
The underlying business 
performance is strong and we 
remain confident in the long-term 
prospects for the Group.
We are pleased with the sales 
performance this year, with 
growth across all areas of our 
business and market share 
gains in both Motoring and 
Cycling. 
It is now 18 months since we launched the Moving Up A 
Gear strategy, aimed at modernising the business and 
consolidating our position as a specialist, service-led 
retailer in order to drive sustainable long-term growth. 
In this report we set out the strong progress in the year, 
alongside good sales performance and continued market 
share gains.
Strategic Progress
Our goal is to be customers’ first choice for their life on 
the move and we will achieve this by being committed to 
Making Customers’ Journeys Better. Our Group strategy 
has five key pillars:
Putting Customers in the Driving Seat 
— investing in customer data and insight 
capabilities to maximise the lifetime customer 
value 
Service in Our DNA  
— embedding the focus on customer service
Building on Our Uniqueness  
— exclusive products, relevant innovation and 
unique partnerships
Better Shopping Experience  
— a seamless customer experience, online as 
well as in store
Fit for the Future Infrastructure  
— moving from fixing the basics to improving 
efficiency and fulfilment 
On pages 16 and 17 we have set out a more detailed 
explanation of the Group strategy, our progress on each 
of these pillars during FY17 and the key areas of focus  
for FY18. 
Market Update
A full review and update of the markets in which we 
operate is set out on pages 10 and 11.
Alternative Performance Measures
In the reporting of financial information, the Directors 
have adopted various Alternative Performance Measures 
(APMs).
*  These APMs are defined within the Key Performance Indicators 
table on page 18.
** Free Cash Flow is defined on page 40.
Summary of Group Results
Revenue of £1,095.0m was up 7.2%, with like-for-like 
(“LFL”)* growth of 2.7%. Gross margin of 51.0% was 220 
basis points lower than the prior year, predominantly 
due to the impact of the movement in foreign currency 
exchange rates. T otal operating costs before non-
recurring items rose by 5.0% reflecting planned 
investments for the Moving Up A Gear strategy and 
the first-time inclusion of the operating expenditure in 
respect of the acquired Tredz and Wheelies businesses. 
The increase in cost of goods associated with the 
depreciation in Sterling had an adverse impact of circa  
£14m (pre-mitigation) which more than accounted for 
the decline in profit for the year. Underlying EBITDA* was 
down 5.1% to £108.7m. Underlying EBIT* was £77.1m, 
which compares with £84.5m in the prior year. Underlying 
Profit Before Tax* was £75.4m and Underlying Basic 
Earnings Per Share* was 30.3p, down 7.5% and 8.7% 
respectively. Profit after tax for the year was £56.4m 
(FY16: £63.5m).

Cash generation remained strong, with Free Cash Flow** 
of £37.7m. Net Debt* at the end of the year was up 
£38.0m at £85.9m, with a Net Debt to Underlying EBITDA 
ratio* of 0.8:1 versus 0.4:1 in the prior year. The increase 
is consistent with our previously stated intention to move 
towards a debt target of 1.0x and reflects our acquisition 
of Tredz and Wheelies in May 2016 for an initial cash 
consideration of £18.0m, the £4.1m investment made in 
Tyres on the Drive Limited (“TOTD”) in January 2017 (with 
a further circa £4m to follow in FY18) and the circa £20m 
special dividend paid in February 2017. 
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend 
of 11.68 pence per share (FY16: 11.34 pence) which, if 
approved, would take the full-year ordinary dividend to 
17.51 pence per share, an increase of 3.0% on the prior 
year. Including the special dividend of 10 pence per 
share paid in February 2017, the full-year dividend per 
share was 27.51 pence, an increase of 61.8% on the  
prior year. If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 
25 August 2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 4 August 2017. 
Retail Operational Review
Halfords Retail achieved a strong year of sales 
performance, with revenue up 8.0% to £938.4m. LFL 
growth of 3.1% reflected Motoring LFL of 2.0% and 
Cycling LFL of 5.1%. Our service-related sales grew by 
11.1% as we continued to consolidate our specialist, 
service-led retail proposition. The LFL sales growth 
is principally attributable to our growing service and 
services proposition, new products and ranges, better 
trained and engaged colleagues and investments made 
to modernise the business as part of the Moving Up A 
Gear strategy.
Within Motoring, Car Maintenance revenues increased 
by 3.1% on a LFL basis, driven by good growth in sales 
of car parts and the fitting and sale of bulbs, blades 
and batteries (“3Bs”). Metal storage and hand tools 
performed very strongly, particularly the increasingly 
popular Halfords Advanced range to which we added new 
products in the year. We were disappointed with the 2.8% 
decline in Car Enhancement LFL revenue, which was 
driven by the continued decline in the sat nav market. 
Partially offsetting this was strong growth in dash cams, 
in-car connectivity equipment and car cleaning products. 
Excluding sat navs, Car Enhancement LFL was up 3.7% 
and sat navs now represent only 3% of Group sales. 
Travel Solutions LFL revenues increased 7.9%, driven by 
robust growth in roof bars and boxes, cycle carriers and 
child seats; all of which benefit from our market-leading 
positions and friendly, highly-trained fitters. 
Cycling sales improved by 5.1% on a LFL basis and 
18.2% on a total sales basis. We took a significant step 
forward in consolidating the Group’s market-leading 
position, growing market share on a like for like basis 
as well as continuing to grow the Cycle Republic chain, 
which grew over 20% like-for-like in the year. Tredz 
and Wheelies also performed strongly in the year, with 
revenue growing over 20%.
The like-for-like growth in Retail was driven by strong 
performances across each of the sub-categories of 
bikes, Parts, Accessories and Clothing (“PACs”) and 
repair. PACs sales returned to growth for the first time 
in two years due to stronger attachment sales, new 
products and a more disciplined approach to ranging, 
using our improving customer insight to introduce a 
“good, better, best” hierarchy. Bike sales were supported 
by the relaunch of our mainstream, award winning 
ranges (Carrera and Apollo) as well as the launch of the 
new, exclusive Wiggins range, and growing demand 
for electric bikes. Our credentials in kids’ bikes were 
validated by the public accreditation from Netmums 
during the year, and Boardman won a host of industry 
awards including the prestigious “BikeBiz” bike brand of 
the year.  
Tredz/Wheelies performed strongly since acquisition 
and we were also very pleased with the Cycle Republic 
performance, now trading from 15 shops and online. We 
now have a unique balance in our offering, able to serve 
the lifestyle consumers through our Halfords stores 
and website, the growing commuter population through 
Cycle Republic and the enthusiast and elite segments 
through both Tredz and Boardman Elite. 
Service-related sales increased by 11.1%, driven in 
particular by cycle repair and elements of motoring 
fitting, such as 3B’s and roof boxes. Although currently a 
small part of the mix, our new “2Bs” (bulbs and batteries) 
fitting for motorbikes and windscreen chip repair for 
cars were contributors to growth. Our service capability 
continues to be a key focus for us, with the Gears training 
programme providing depth and breadth of experience 
for colleagues, supporting our ability to establish 
Halfords as a differentiated, service-led specialist retailer. 
Online Retail revenue grew by 30.5% in total and 6.3% 
LFL. The importance of our store network and service 
overlay continued to be highlighted by the strength 
of Click & Collect, with around 85% of Halfords Retail 
online orders picked up in store. This high proportion of 
click and collect continues to differentiate us from other 
retailers, as our online business, instead of cannibalising 
our bricks and mortar operation, drives footfall into our 
stores, with over 80% of customers wanting advice or 
fitting service with their purchase.
We enter the new financial year with good momentum. 
We have published trading performance for the 15 
weeks to the end of April 2017, which includes the 11 
weeks to the end of the financial year and the first 4 
weeks of the new year. We consider this period to be 
more representative of performance because it includes 
Easter in both the current year and the comparatives. 
Revenue for this 15-week period was up 3.9% on a LFL 
basis, comprising Motoring +0.9% and Cycling +11.1%.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Autocentres
Autocentres revenues were up 2.4% and, on a LFL basis, 
up 0.6%. Online sales were strong, with web booking 
revenues up 29.1%. Consistent with our strategic 
priorities of  ‘Service in Our DNA’ and ‘putting customers 
in the driving seat’, it has been a year of long-term 
investment in colleagues and creating an improved offer 
to customers. 
T o benefit colleagues, we have introduced a new 
technician pay grading system this year, to reward both 
teamwork and training. We also continued to invest in 
training and development, with 86 apprentices taken on 
in the year demonstrating our commitment to developing 
young talent and helping our colleagues learn long-
lasting skills. We now have 4 training centres open to 
develop our MOT and hybrid testers. During the year our 
colleague turnover reached the lowest that it has been 
for almost 3 years, reflecting these investments as well 
as the operational changes we introduced. 
T o benefit customers, we have introduced Sunday and 
Bank Holiday opening and are also committed to training 
one technician in every centre in electric and hybrid car 
maintenance by April next year. We are well underway 
on this journey. In addition, 16 centres were refreshed 
during the year and these refreshes included customer 
service pods, TV screens, Wi-Fi, coffee and large viewing 
windows. They resonated well with customers, enhancing 
the shopping experience. 
These operational changes were made for long-term 
benefit, but have been disruptive in the short-term 
and despite many positive developments we were 
dissatisfied with the financial results for the year. 
Accordingly, we are taking a number of actions including 
a review of the operating model. We see a presence in 
the car servicing and repair market as important for the 
Group in order to have a comprehensive suite of services 
for the “second life of the car”. We also see a good 
growth opportunity; we currently only have around a 
1.5% share of a highly fragmented circa £9bn market. We 
will report our conclusions in due course. 
M&A Activity
During the year we expanded the Group’s capabilities 
in motoring and cycling with two modest, highly 
complementary investments. 
In May 2016 we acquired Tredz and Wheelies for an initial 
£18.0m, with a further circa £5m to be paid in the first 
half of FY18. Tredz is a UK-wide online retailer of premium 
bikes and PACs and Wheelies is the UK’s largest provider 
of bicycle replacement for insurance companies. This 
acquisition extends our presence in the online market 
for premium bikes, parts, accessories and clothing, and 
together with our rollout of Cycle Republic means we 
now address all major segments of the cycling market.
In January 2017 we entered into an operating agreement, 
accompanied by the acquisition of a minority stake, with 
TyresOnTheDrive.com (“TOTD”), a UK mobile tyre fitting 
business, to develop opportunities to leverage each 
other’s capability and expertise. We see a number of 
sales and cost synergies as well as the opportunity for 
Halfords to trial an innovative mobile delivery proposition 
for motoring services, which fits squarely with our focus 
on improving our service and convenience credentials. 
We continue to investigate similar opportunities to 
expand our capabilities and strengthen our positions in 
our core markets.
Financial Targets and  
Capital Allocation Priorities 
We continue to apply our four key financial targets: 
• Grow sales faster than the markets in which we 
operate; 
• Hold group EBITDA margin broadly flat over the next 
few years (excluding the impact of FX);
• Grow the ordinary dividend every year with a dividend 
coverage of 2 times on average over time (excluding 
the impact of FX); and
• Net debt target of 1x Underlying EBITDA with a range 
of up to 1.5x.
In the Chief Financial Officer’s review we explain these 
targets in more detail and appraise our performance 
against them.
During the year we made progress towards our debt 
target, moving from 0.4x to 0.8x through consistent 
application of our clear capital allocation priorities. 
Central to our capital allocation policy is to maintain a 
strong and prudent balance sheet, and we will use our 
debt target as a guide for that. Our priorities for use of 
cash will continue to be: firstly, capital investment to grow 
the business in line with previous guidance; secondly, to 
pay and grow the ordinary dividend every year; thirdly, 
for any appropriate M&A opportunities which may arise; 
and thereafter, any excess cash would be available for 
additional distribution to shareholders.

Summary and Outlook 
We are pleased with the sales performance in the 
last financial year, with growth across all areas of our 
business and market share gains in both Motoring and 
Cycling. Our focus on, and investment in, services was 
reflected in the significant growth of service-related 
sales. We are also pleased with the momentum building 
as we implement our Moving Up A Gear strategy. There 
is demonstrable progress across each of the five pillars 
of the plan and plenty more to come. Whilst the currency 
movements have impacted on reported earnings, the 
underlying business performance was strong.
Our priorities for the financial year we are now in will 
include further improving and utilising our customer 
data, consolidating our service and services credentials, 
continuing to invest in our colleagues, further investment 
in our online platforms and rolling out our successful new 
store refresh concept.
We enter a challenging period from a macroeconomic 
perspective, with uncertainty over consumer spending 
and Sterling depreciation bringing input cost headwinds. 
However, we approach this on the front foot and from 
a position of strength as we have leading positions 
in fragmented markets and offer a customer driven, 
service-led proposition that differentiates us from 
competitors, both physical and online. 
Our FX headwind mitigation plans are well developed 
and gaining traction. We are seeing the benefits of good 
strategic progress on performance and have not so far 
observed any noticeable adverse impact of a change in 
consumer sentiment on our trading. Taking these factors 
into account we anticipate FY18 profit to be in line with 
current market expectations. 
I would like to thank all colleagues for their fantastic 
contribution, support and commitment to Halfords. Our 
customer-centric, service-led strategy has real traction 
and I have every confidence in the team to drive the 
Moving Up A Gear strategy to the next level so that we 
continue to deliver further progress across the Group.
