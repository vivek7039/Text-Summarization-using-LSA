Strategic Report Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
6 Halma’s purpose is to protect life 
and improve the quality of life 
through innovative safety, health 
and environmental solutions. 
This provides us with exciting 
opportunities for growth in a diverse 
range of markets and with a strong 
motivation to make a positive 
difference to people’s lives worldwide.
We have a clear growth strategy, a 
simple financial model and a unique 
organisational structure, which is 
customer-focused and enables us 
to adapt quickly to market changes.
Halma has had a well-established 
financial target that aims to double 
our earnings every five years, without 
becoming highly geared or seeking 
further equity, provided there are 
similar rates of organic, acquisitive and 
dividend growth. This aspiration pushes 
our businesses to deliver sustainable 
revenue growth by increasing 
investment in innovation, talent and 
international expansion rather than 
limiting their focus only on operational 
efficiency and short-term profitability.
Over the past five years, we have 
achieved compound annual growth 
rates of 10% for revenue and 11% for 
profit with a good balance between 
organic, acquisition and dividend 
growth. This strong performance 
reflects not only our sound growth 
strategy but also the exceptional 
commitment, abilities and dedication 
of talented individuals in every part 
of Halma. I thank all of them for their 
contribution to this financial success 
and, in the process, realising our 
shared purpose and making a positive 
difference to people’s lives worldwide.
Record revenue and profit
Halma performed strongly over the 
past year, achieving its fourteenth 
consecutive year of record revenue 
and profit.
Revenue increased by 19% to £962m 
(2016: £808m) including 4% organic 
constant currency growth and 10% 
favourable currency impact. Adjusted
1
 
profit increased by 17% to £194m (2016: 
£166m), also including 4% organic 
constant currency growth and 10% 
favourable currency impact. There were 
52 weeks trading in this year compared 
with 53 weeks trading last year.
Returns were maintained at a high level 
with Return on Sales of 20.2% (2016: 
20.6%) well within our targeted range 
of 18% to 22%. Return on Capital 
Employed for our operating companies 
remained high at 72% (2016: 72%). 
The Group’s Return on Total Invested 
Capital was 15.3% (2016: 15.6%).
Cash generation and balance sheet 
supports future growth
Cash generation was good and we 
ended the year with net debt of £196m 
(2016: £247m) after spending £10m on 
current year acquisitions (2016: £193m), 
£24m on capital expenditure 
(2016: £24m), £50m on dividends 
to shareholders (2016: £47m), and 
paying £33m of tax (2016: £27m).
With gearing at the year end (net 
debt to EBITDA) of 0.86 times (2016: 
1.27 times), we have a strong balance 
sheet which can support further 
strategic investment. In November 
2016, we increased and extended our 
revolving credit facilities from £360m 
until 2018 to £550m until 2021. 
Final dividend to increase by 7%
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend increase of 7%, giving a final 
dividend of 8.38p (2016: 7.83p) and a 
total dividend for the year of 13.71p 
(2016: 12.81p). The final dividend 
per share is subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM on 20 July 
2017 and will be paid on 16 August 
2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 14 July 2017.
Growth in all major regions
A major benefit for businesses within 
Halma is the support they receive 
to build their business in key export 
markets. This year, once again, this 
was reflected in the widespread 
revenue growth achieved in both 
developing and developed regions.
There was impressive growth in Asia 
Pacific where revenue increased 21% 
to £152m (2016: £125m), including 9% 
organic constant currency growth. 
Revenue from China was up by 25% to 
£68m (2016: £54m), with 11% organic 
constant currency growth. Revenue 
from Other regions grew by 16% to 
£99m (2016: £86m) with good growth 
in Canada.
Revenue from Mainland Europe grew 
by 17% to £210m (2016: £179m) 
including 6% organic constant 
currency growth while UK revenue was 
up by 7% to £155m (2016: £145m) with 
5% organic constant currency growth.
The USA remained our largest regional 
market with revenue increasing by 
27% to £345m (2016: £273m) and 1% 
organic constant currency growth. 
Growth in all four sectors
There was revenue and profit growth 
in all four sectors. All sectors achieved 
record revenue and all, except Process 
Safety, also generated record profit.
The Medical sector became our largest 
profit sector for the first time, with 
profit
2
 up by 29% to £66.7m (2016: 
£51.7) including 6% organic constant 
currency growth. Revenue grew by 31% 
to £261m (2016: £199m) with organic 
constant currency growth of 4%. 
Return on Sales remained strong at 
25.6% (2016: 26.0%).
Regionally, the highest rate of organic 
constant currency revenue growth was 
in Asia Pacific and there was good 
progress in China. There were lower 
rates of organic growth in the UK and 
the USA, which is the largest region 
representing 52% of the sector. 
There was a small organic constant 
currency decline in Mainland Europe. 
Visiometrics and CenTrak, acquired 
in December 2015 and February 2016 
respectively, delivered improved 
performances as the year progressed.
Infrastructure Safety profit
2
 grew 
by an impressive 17% to £65.1m 
(2016: £55.6m) and revenue rose 
by 19% to £315m (2016: £265m). 
Both included organic constant 
currency growth of 7%. Return 
on Sales was 20.7% (2016: 21.2%).
There was strong organic constant 
currency revenue growth in Asia Pacific, 
the UK and Mainland Europe (the 
largest region at 30% of the sector) 
supported by excellent progress from 
our Fire and Door Safety businesses. 
There was organic constant currency 
revenue decline in the USA, partly due 
to a weaker performance from our Fire 
businesses, including Firetrace which 
we acquired in October 2015. We have 
continued to strengthen Firetrace’s 
management team from within Halma 
and we expect its performance to 
improve as we move through 2017. 
We remain confident in its longer-term 
growth potential, especially in 
international markets.
The Environmental & Analysis sector 
increased profit
2
 substantially by 
21% to £41.7m (2016: £34.5m), which 
continued the excellent progress made 
last year and included 6% organic 
constant currency growth. Revenue 
grew by 16% to £219m (2016: £189m) 
with organic constant currency growth 
of 4%. Return on Sales improved from 
18.3% to 19.0%.

 rose by 2% to

was a 4% organic constant currency 
decline for the full year, there was 
organic constant currency profit 
growth of 4% in the second half of 
the year. Return on Sales for the year 
remained strong at 24.1% (2016: 25.4%).
There was impressive organic constant 
currency growth in the Near and Middle 
East and modest improvements in the 
USA and Mainland Europe. There was 
a small organic revenue decline in the 
UK and reduced demand in our pipeline 
management sub-sector contributed to 
organic revenue decline in Asia Pacific.
In overall terms this was an encouraging 
year and Process Safety is now much 
better placed to sustain growth, with 
less reliance on energy and resources 
markets than one year ago.
One acquisition completed;  
M&A resource strengthened
Our core acquisition strategy is to find 
privately-owned businesses operating 
in niches within safety, health or 
environmental markets. Our search 
efforts are typically focused on our 
core, or closely adjacent, market niches 
although each Halma sector has the 
freedom to find new niches which 
possess the right product, market and 
financial characteristics. In almost all 
cases we acquire 100% of an entity but 
we will consider a minority investment 
to gain access to potentially valuable 
intellectual property if an outright 
purchase is not appropriate or possible.
Our sector-focused organisation 
model gives us the scalability to 
continue acquiring small-to-medium 
sized businesses to achieve our 
strategic growth objectives. We are 
also able to sell and merge businesses 
relatively easily should specific market 
dynamics change. This active portfolio 
management has meant the number 
of businesses within Halma has 
been relatively stable, reducing 
the potential for concerns over 
management’s increasing span-of-
control as we grow. In 2007, Halma 
had revenue of £355m from 39 
operating companies while today, 
we have revenue of £962m from 42 
operating companies.
During the year, we added further M&A 
resource to our four sector boards and 
the benefits of this are becoming 
apparent in the improved balance 
of our acquisition pipeline across 
The highest rates of organic constant 
currency revenue growth were 
achieved in Asia Pacific, with China 
achieving double-digit growth and 
now contributing 12% of sector 
revenue. There was good growth in 
the USA and solid progress in the UK. 
Mainland Europe saw organic revenue 
decline after weaker demand 
from certain OEM customers 
headquartered in the region.
During the year we completed the 
restructuring of our photonics 
coatings business, Pixelteq. The 
exceptional costs associated with this 
project were reported in our first half 
results. The profitability benefits 
started to emerge in the final quarter 
of 2016/17 and are expected to make a 
positive contribution to profit growth 
in the 2017/18 financial year, despite 
the small revenue reduction arising 
from this consolidation.
The Process Safety sector’s 
performance improved as the year 
progressed, benefiting from sustained 
increased investment in market 
diversification and improving demand 
from the US onshore energy market in 
the second half of the year. Revenue 
increased by 7% to a record £167m 
(2016: £155m) with a relatively

8 sectors and in the increasing number 
of visits made to targeted businesses. 
The M&A market continues to be 
competitive with high multiples being 
paid for businesses in many of our 
attractive market niches. This 
highlights the need for us to build 
strong relationships with business 
owners, sometimes over a number of 
years, so that they already see Halma 
as a great home for their business 
when they eventually decide to sell. 
Every transaction is approved by the 
Group Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director, with all deals 
£10m or over requiring Halma plc 
Board approval.
In January 2017, we acquired FluxData, 
a New York based manufacturer of 
advanced multi-spectral and digital 
imaging systems for multiple market 
segments including industrial and 
medical applications. FluxData builds on 
multi-spectral imaging capabilities that 
already exist in our Environmental & 
Analysis sector. Joining Halma offers 
FluxData the opportunity to access 
new niches and regions for safety, 
health and environmental markets. 
The consideration paid was 
US$12m (£9.9m) with further 
contingent consideration of up 
to US$15.5m (£12.8m) based on 
its performance to 31 March 2019.
Increasing strategic investment for 
growth and the 4
th
 Industrial Revolution
We have a clear understanding of how 
we want our businesses to benefit 
from being part of Halma. We 
demonstrate this by making targeted 
central investments and building a 
strong collaborative culture. Over 
the past decade, our primary focus 
has been on Talent Development, 
Innovation and International 
Expansion. These central investments 
have led to individual sector initiatives 
targeted at opportunities and 
challenges which are particularly 
relevant to that sector.
Increasingly, we are seeing the 
opportunities and challenges of the  
‘4
th
 Industrial Revolution’ and we are 
gaining a better appreciation of the 
influential role that we can play in the 
development of our safety, health and 
environmental markets. Many of 
our businesses have been using or 
experimenting with technologies such 
as robotics and 3D printing for some 
time. Increasingly our products are 
sensing, analysing and communicating 
data either as part of a larger 
connected system or as stand-alone 
solutions. In order to be successful in 
this changing world the ability to 
combine technologies is increasingly 
important and we are relentlessly 
improving our collaborative capabilities. 
We have completed the search for 
the new role of Chief Innovation 
and Digital Officer for the Halma 
Executive Board and are pleased to 
announce that Inken Braunschmidt will 
be joining the Group in early July 2017. 
Inken will be joining us from innogy SE, 
a renewables energy company based in 
Essen, Germany and spun out of RWE 
in 2016. In recent years, Inken led the 
innovation and digital transformation 
at RWE with a customer and people-
centred approach. Prior to that, Inken 
was MD of RWE’s Strategy and 
Management Consultancy practice. 
Her role at Halma will similarly be 
critical in both accelerating the 
development of innovative digital 
strategies and in building a stronger 
collaborative community both inside 
the Group and with external partners.
In April 2017, we held our biennial 
innovation, collaboration and 
experimentation event, HITEx in 
San Diego, USA. Board members 
from all Halma companies attended 
a three-day event which included 
sessions focused on harnessing new 
technologies, developing more 
ambitious growth strategies and 
understanding the value of strategic 
partnerships. As always, the event 
highlighted the impressive capabilities 
and growth potential of our businesses 
but also reminded us of the need to 
constantly improve and change in 
order to be successful in the future.
R&D spend increased  
to 5.3% of revenue
New product innovation is a vital 
component of creating organic 
growth and enables each Halma 
company to increase its revenue 
and profitability through market 
share gain and market expansion.
Our investment in new product 
development increased substantially, 
with a record R&D spend up by 23% 
to £50.6m (2016: £41.2m). This was a 
13% increase at constant currency and 
represented 5.3% of Group revenue 
(2016: 5.1%), also a new record.
The decentralised nature of Halma 
means that each Halma company 
determines its own R&D spend 
according to its market opportunity. 
All four sectors increased R&D spend 
with the relative investment levels 
ranging from 3.6% of revenue for 
Process Safety up to 6.9% for 
Environmental & Analysis.
We track the effectiveness of this 
investment in a variety of ways 
including the proportion of revenue 
generated from new products 
launched in the past three years. 
Over the past four years, the average 
contribution to Group revenue from 
products launched in the past three 
years has been around 22% although 
the individual company metrics range 
from single digit to over 50%.
Since 2004, the best examples of 
innovation in Halma have been 
celebrated and recognised each year 
through the Halma Annual Innovation 
Awards. All employees are able to 
enter, offering them a first prize of 
£20,000. This year the winner of 
the New Product award was BEA’s 
Flatscan laser sensor, which has 
transformed safety in swinging doors 
as well as promising further growth 
opportunities in other markets. 
First prize in the Process award was 
Fortress Interlocks’ online interactive 
tool which helps customers easily 
configure and order customised 
products from a standard product 
platform. The Collaboration 
category was won by Ocean Optics 
and Fiberguide who co-developed 
a product to test the authenticity 
of bank notes in China.
Corporate responsibility and 
sustainability is at Halma’s core
Halma’s core strategy is to protect 
life and improve quality of life for 
people worldwide. Our primary market 
growth drivers mean that Halma 
companies operate in markets in 
which their products contribute 
positively to the wider community. 
These market characteristics and our 
commitment to health and safety, the 
environment and people development 
are reflected in the values held by our 
employees and our operating culture. 
A detailed report on our approach to 
Corporate Responsibility, including 
our CO
2
 emissions reduction 
performance, is on pages 56 to 59.
Outlook
Halma operates in a diverse range 
of market niches where demand 
is supported by resilient long-term 
growth drivers. We are able to grow 
faster than our markets through 
sustainable and increasing investment 
in innovation, international expansion 
and strategy-led talent management. 
Our growth mind-set extends to our 
M&A activity where we buy businesses 
to increase investment for growth 
rather than reduce costs.
Since the period end, order intake has 
continued to be ahead of revenue and 
order intake last year. We expect to 
make further progress in the year 
ahead in line with our expectations.

9 Understanding our 
stakeholders’ needs 
Chief Executive Q&A
Q
What is Halma’s  
financial model?
Halma has a simple financial model. 
Our aspiration is to double every five 
years, through a mix of acquisitions 
and organic growth. Because we 
generate high returns and strong cash 
generation, we are able to invest for 
growth as well paying an increasing 
dividend to shareholders.
Q 
What is  
Halma’s strategy?
We choose markets with resilient 
growth drivers, including increased 
safety regulation, increasing demand 
for healthcare and life-critical 
resources (e.g. water). Within these 
markets, we select product niches 
with strong intellectual property that 
deliver high, sustainable returns. 
We have an agile, de-centralised 
operating model which makes 
sure resources are placed close to 
customers. We drive organic growth 
through investment in innovation 
(e.g. R&D spend has grown from 
£15.3m to £50.6m since 2007), 
international expansion (e.g. revenue 
from outside the UK, Europe 
and the USA has increased from 
£67.8m to £251.1m since 2007) 
and talent (a major priority and 
competitive differentiator for us). 
Acquisitions are also an important 
part of our growth.
Q 
How do this year’s results 
reflect Halma’s strategy?
These results show the benefits of 
our market and geographic diversity. 
Having an agile and flexible operating 
model means our businesses can 
adjust quickly to their markets, as 
opportunities change. Having a 
de-centralised model is at the heart 
of our financial performance – 
supporting 14 consecutive years of 
record revenues, profits and dividends.
Q
How has Halma performed  
over the long term?
Very strongly. Halma’s growth and 
consistency is a key differentiator. 
The Group has delivered revenue 
growth in 41 of the past 43 years, 
and a return on sales higher than 16% 
for the past 32 years. Over the past 
decade, revenue has grown every year, 
from £355m to £962m, a CAGR of 
c.10%. In the same period, profit has 
grown from £66m to £194m. This has 
enabled us to increase our dividend 
by 5% or more every year for the 
past 38 years.
Q 
What does Halma look 
for in acquisitions?
We typically acquire relatively small 
businesses, in the £10m to £100m 
price range, that share Halma’s 
key characteristics. They operate in, 
and adjacent to, our existing markets 
and are financially strong. Most of 
these deals we source ourselves.
Q
What is Halma’s acquisition track 
record over the past ten years?
Our strong financial resources have 
enabled us to spend £645m on 
26 acquisitions since 2007. In the 
last few years, we have added 
dedicated M&A resources at sector 
level, making us well placed to 
continue this successful track record.
Q
How will Halma sustain  
its future growth?
Halma’s strategy is based on growth, 
organically and through acquisitions. 
In 2014 we created four sectors, 
‘mini Halmas’ – Process Safety, 
Infrastructure Safety, Medical and 
Environmental & Analysis – each with 
the potential to be the size of Halma 
today. This gives us a structure to 
support growth over the medium to 
long term, while retaining the unique, 
decentralised operating model that 
has driven our success. The sector 
set-up means we can maintain the 
current pace of acquisitions and 
continue to focus on relatively small 
companies. It is also helping to drive 
organic growth – for example, through 
sharing technology, pooling information 
on our customers and collaborating 
for international expansion.
