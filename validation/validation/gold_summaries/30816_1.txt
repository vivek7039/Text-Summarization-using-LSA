Chief Executive’s review 
Performance overview and financial highlights 
2017 was a strong year of progress for CloudCall with revenue growing by 42%, to £6.9m, and recurring 
revenue growing by 55% compared to the previous year, driven in part by a 45% increase in the 
number of end users to just over 23,500. 
The decision to target sales and marketing activity towards larger mid-sized businesses has proven to 
be a successful strategy.  Over the course of 2017, our average customer size grew by 24% from 21.6 
to 26.9 and we are now growing revenues from within a number of significant new customers.  This 
trend is particularly marked within the recruitment and staffing sector with several new key accounts 
growing rapidly, making inroads into our top 10 customer list.    
The efficiencies of scale that come with these larger customers means that they are generally more 
profitable to CloudCall, have higher retention rates and enable the opportunity to add more users as 
the relationship evolves. It should be noted however, that their enhanced purchasing power with often 
larger and longer commercial terms being negotiated has had a slight adverse impact on overall average 
recurring revenue per user. 
Elsewhere across the business, we have continued to make good progress. Improvements to our 
customer on-boarding processes have helped reduce the average time between order received and go-
live to approximately 5 weeks, meaning that new customers commence billing earlier than has 
previously been the case. Customer satisfaction is continuing to climb, evidenced by the fact that our 
customer support team continues to deliver excellent support ratings averaging 96%, and the number 
of customers required to be managed by our “at-risk” triaging process has also fallen during the year. 
The net effect of this has been a 10% reduction in monthly churn rates achieved over the course of 
the year, and we continue to see improvements as we enter 2018. 
Constrained growth 
Whilst these growth rates are impressive, our performance was, to some extent, restricted by a number 
of constraining factors. Indeed, 2017 would be better described as being a year of consolidation and 
preparation, with the business focussing on strengthening the foundations that will support future 
growth. 
Prior to the fundraise in the autumn, of which the VCT/EIS element received HMRC advance approval 
on 29 November, the Group was undeniably cash constrained with available cash resources only 
allowing for limited investment in sales and marketing activity. Growth rates to date have been achieved 
with minimal outbound marketing, and with sales staff numbers held at minimum viable levels. This 
lack of dedicated resources has historically held back the rate of new customer acquisition, particularly 
in the US, where our addressable market is four or five times that of the UK. 
In the run up to the year-end, and continuing into 2018, the additional funds raised are allowing us to 
begin expanding our sales and marketing functions and I look forward to reporting on progress later in 
the year.   Cloudcall Group plc

Resource limitations were also being keenly felt in product development, where for much of the year a 
significant portion of our software development resource was focussed on rebuilding our core 
infrastructure into a robust, multi-channel communications platform that would enable us to scale more 
quickly in 2018. This exercise naturally restricted our ability to launch new revenue impacting products 
and services in 2017. 
An improved platform to facilitate growth 
Driven largely by the millennial generation, there is an underlying shift from the more traditional 
methods of communication towards texting and instant messaging. To allow the Group to take 
advantage of this trend it was necessary to rebuild the underlying architecture to efficiently expand its 
product beyond supporting just voice communications to include texting and messaging capabilities as 
part of a multi-channel unified communications solution. 
Historically, CloudCall built bespoke solutions for each CRM partner, resulting in differing levels of 
functionality and an ongoing development overhead associated with maintaining these multiple bespoke 
software bases.  Continuing with this approach, would have necessitated building bespoke iterations of 
any new feature, such as SMS or messaging, for each supported CRM integration.  
The new platform architecture is designed with the software components broken down into modules 
and held centrally as a ‘software library’.  This allows CRM integrations to be built as simpler 
frameworks, that ‘pull’ their required functionality modules from this central software library.  This 
approach has multiple benefits in that it improves consistency, lowers maintenance overheads, allows 
for faster deployment of new functionality and increases the ease and speed of new integrations with 
additional CRMs.  
The updated solution also significantly improves the user interface and provides a more intuitive user 
journey.  In November, our latest Bullhorn integration was released on this new platform.  Since then 
we have also released a new integration with Microsoft Dynamics CRM on the new platform and expect 
to have finished upgrading our Salesforce integration by May 2018. Feedback from customers using 
the new platform has been extremely positive.   
Now that this fundamental architectural change has been made, we are able to move forward at a 
much faster pace. I’m pleased to be able to report that since the year-end, development work on 
building our SMS and instant messaging services has been progressing well and we are currently on 
schedule to release this functionality in May 2018. We are already aware of considerable interest from 
both existing customers and prospective customers and so, when launched, we anticipate an increase 
in revenues from both existing customers and improving new customer signup rates. 
Strengthening ties with Bullhorn 
Our relationship with Bullhorn has continued to strengthen and its staff’s knowledge of, and confidence 
in, the CloudCall service noticeably improved when it selected us as its own telecoms provider, which 
is already improving lead flow to CloudCall from Bullhorn’s own sales teams.    Cloudcall Group plc

Prior to Bullhorn’s acquisition of Connexys in September 2017, our penetration of Bullhorn’s user base 
stood at ~25% in Europe and ~6% in North America.  However, adjusting for that acquisition, 
repositions our penetration of their revised total EMEA users to 14%.   
In March 2018, Bullhorn announced that it had completed the acquisitions of both Talentrover and 
Jobscience, recruitment CRMs built on the Force.com platform (like Connexys). Whilst it remains very 
early days in terms of quantifying exactly what this means for CloudCall in terms of addressable market, 
it is very clear to see that our strong relationship with Bullhorn, in conjunction with their recent 
acquisition driven growth represents a very significant opportunity to CloudCall. 
Increasing our focus on recruitment and staffing 
Further segmentation of the global CRM market has enabled us to identify a vibrant recruitment and 
staffing sector, employing over 12 million people globally. CloudCall’s suite of integrated 
communications products is a strong fit for this sector and is appreciated by firms looking to adopt 
technology that helps them increase their speed in contacting candidates. This is something that 
CloudCall’s solution excels at. 
The Group’s success in this sector, its strong relationship with Bullhorn with its enhanced customer 
base, together with CloudCall’s growing reputation, has led the Board to decide to focus more heavily 
on this sector, before exploring other markets.  
Our culture 
Over the year, staff numbers increased from 89 to 119, reflecting our desire to capitalise on the market 
opportunity that exists today. We are continuing to focus on creating a caring and inclusive culture and 
are investing more in improving our staff mentoring, training and support mechanisms.  I’m delighted 
to say that the various charity and community initiatives we launched in 2016 are now flourishing.  I 
believe this can be exemplified by numerous staff members braving the ‘Beast from the East’ cold all 
night, looking out for, and helping homeless people in Leicester completely from their own initiative, 
which made me particularly proud. 
I’m also keen that CloudCall acts as a responsible employer, and a caring neighbour wherever it is 
represented around the world, because I firmly believe that following this path generates benefits that 
extend well beyond the obvious.

Outlook 
As we continue to grow our recurring revenue, it is clear that growth in the first half of the year has a 
far greater cumulative impact on the year’s total revenue number than growth in the latter part of a 
year. I’m therefore pleased to announce that whilst we don’t expect to see full contribution from our 
newly hired sales heads until Q2, our existing sales team have had a strong January and February and 
that trading is in line with expectations.
