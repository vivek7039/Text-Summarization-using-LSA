ANOTHER YEAR 
OF GOOD PERFORMANCE
GROUP REVENUE WAS:
£2,216.5m
OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND 
NON‑UNDERLYING ITEMS WAS UP:
4.9%
ADJUSTED BASIC EARNINGS 
PER SHARE GREW:
1.3%
Performance summary
Total revenue grew 6.9% to a record high of £2,216.5m, driven by another 
good performance from the underlying business and by the additional 
seven weeks of Spirit trading in comparison with last year. 
EBITDA
1,2
 surpassed £500m for the first time in the company’s history, 
reaching £524.1m, up 5.5% on last year. 
Operating profit before exceptional and non-underlying items
1,2
 was up 4.9% 
at £411.5m while the operating margin
1,2
 decreased 0.3%pts to 18.6%. 
This comprised a positive contribution from Spirit synergies, offset by 
brand conversion costs and the more challenging cost environment. 
Pub Company delivered LFL sales growth
1,2
 of 1.5%, outperforming the 
market by 0.4%pts
3
. Total sales growth in Pub Company was 7.7%, while 
operating profit grew 3.0% to £308.1m. 11 new pubs were opened during 
the year while 65 disposals were completed. 
Pub Partners revenue was up 5.8% to £198.8m and LFL net profit growth
2
 
was up 5.0%. Average EBITDA
1,2
 per pub increased 7.9%, reflecting further 
improvements in estate quality as a result of the Spirit acquisition, the 
disposal of 54 pubs from the combined estate and synergy contribution. 
Operating profit grew 8.8% to £92.8m. 
Brewing & Brands achieved revenue of £200.3m in the year, up 1.7%. OBV 
was down 2.8%, in line with the total ale market and beating the cask ale 
market. Our share of the UK cask ale market was 10.3%. Operating profit 
was down 5.2% to £31.0m and operating profit margin was down 1.1%pts 
to 15.5%. Factors impacting profit conversion included increased cost of 
goods sold and investment in marketing and price, mainly in the second 
half of the year. 
The integration of Spirit was completed a year early with annual cost 
synergy realisation of £35m. 
The group delivered strong free cash flow
2
 from operations of £119.6m and 
we again covered our debt service obligation, core capital expenditure and 
dividend from internally generated cash. Net debt to EBITDA
1,2
 was 4.0x. 
Adjusted earnings per share grew 1.3% to 70.8p and we have recommended 
a 3.6% increase in the dividend per share, maintaining our long-term 
progressive dividend policy. 
The business achieved another year of strong returns, generating a ROCE
2
 
of 9.4%, which remains comfortably above our weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC).
1.  Adjusted measures exclude the impact of exceptional and non-underlying items 
as detailed in note 3 of this statement.
2.  The directors use a number of alternative performance measures (APMs) that are 
considered critical to aid understanding of the group’s performance. Key measures 
are explained on page 127 of this report.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Trading environment
Consumer confidence in the UK has softened over the last 12 months 
with nominal wage growth starting to fall behind rising levels of cost 
inflation leading to a squeeze on disposable household income. While 
spending on essentials has held up, discretionary spending has started to 
fall. Within this, we believe that affordable treats such as visits to the pub 
will continue to play an important role in consumer discretionary spending. 
We anticipate that this challenging environment will intensify over the next 
few years, partly due to the ongoing political and economic uncertainty 
in the UK. If this is the case, we think our business model is well placed 
to outperform the market: Pub Company has good national coverage with 
a bias towards London and the South East; we operate pubs in the value, 
mainstream and premium sectors; and we have a good mix of sales between 
drink, food and rooms. In addition, 30% of our profits come from our 
cash-generative non-retail businesses, Pub Partners and Brewing & Brands. 
Our business model 
is well placed 
to outperform 
the market.
As well as the macro themes evident over the last year, we have also seen 
a number of developing consumer trends within the eating and drinking out 
sectors. Consumers are raising their expectations for their eating and drinking 
out experiences, particularly in the value, quality, service and environment 
of the offer, while they are also increasingly seeking out healthier options 
in their food and drink options. The digitalisation of leisure continues to 
develop at pace, with digital channels becoming increasingly important 
in getting closer to the consumer and in growing market share. We are 
active in using our scale, following the Spirit integration, to continue to 
invest in areas to ensure we meet consumer expectations going forward.
At the same time that the consumer is becoming more demanding, the 
cost environment has become more challenging. Regulatory pressures 
including the National Living Wage, the Apprenticeship Levy and business 
rates, compounded by inflation and foreign exchange costs, are impacting 
margins across the hospitality industry. We are at an advantage in that 
we have the benefits of the Spirit acquisition and integration to help offset 
these cost pressures but we shall also seek out opportunities for further 
cost savings. 
Due in some degree to the cost pressures described above, competition 
for market share is intensifying and broadening. We are the leading pub 
company in an eating and drinking out market that is expected to grow 
7.2%, or £6.2bn, over the next few years
1
. At the same time, it is expected 
that the local, wet-led pub sector will see an ongoing decline in the number 
of pubs, following falls of 12.5%, 8.2% and 12.5% in England, Scotland and 
Wales since 2011
2
. Competition for wet-led pubs comes predominantly 
from the off-trade, where we are seeing continued discounting being used 
to drive volume. Competition for our food-led destination pubs comes 
from the increasing supply of food-led outlets, expected to increase 1.9% 
between 2017 and 2020

, but also from the night in, supported by better 
home comforts, value offers from grocers and growth in delivery and 
takeaway aggregator sites.

Integration 
Following the acquisition of Spirit in June 2015, we have managed to complete 
its integration in just two years, one year ahead of the original schedule. 
This integration has created a much stronger business and a better platform 
for long-term growth and outperformance. There have been four key 
elements to the physical integration of Greene King and Spirit:
1.  Cost synergies – having originally targeted annual cost synergies of 
£30m within three years, we subsequently upgraded the target to 
£35m and we have managed to meet that target within two years. 
The main elements of the cost synergies included savings through 
overheads, purchasing and distribution. We may be able to generate 
additional synergies from the acquisition and these could be used to 
both invest in key areas of our business, such as people, systems and 
brands, and to offset some of the cost increases we are experiencing.
2.  IT systems – we have seamlessly rolled out the Pub Company IT 
system into over 1,700 pubs. We have also developed a single database 
for the combined business which is now in use and which is increasing 
customer insight while significantly improving efficiencies. 
3.  Distribution – the Spirit and Greene King food supply chains have 
been consolidated. Over 1,000 pubs have successfully changed their 
supply model with no impact on availability to menu items. We have 
also finished consolidating our non-food supply chain and our integrated 
drinks supply chain is in place. The integration of supply chains will 
enable us to optimise our network and improve group efficiency. 
4.  Organisation structures – we have completed an organisational 
restructure of the wider group, including reorganising the functions 
and teams within Pub Company to better align to our focus brands 
and combining the leadership of Pub Partners and Brewing & Brands. 
We believe this will enable further development of our focus brands, 
as well as delivering cost efficiencies and further synergies from the 
combined management of the non-retail divisions. We have also 
appointed a new chief commercial officer, who joined from Reckitt 
Benckiser and is responsible for all Greene King’s retail commercial 
activities across both the marketing and trading functions, and a new 
group HR director who joins us from Brakes in October. 
The integration of 
Spirit has created 
a better platform 
for long-term growth 
and outperformance. Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 15
STRATEGIC REPORT
With the integration complete, we can increase focus on our brand 
optimisation strategy. This strategy is targeted at creating efficiencies through 
having a smaller number of larger pub retail brands including the five focus 
brands of Greene King Locals, Hungry Horse, Flaming Grill, Farmhouse 
Inns and Chef & Brewer. In the year, we spent £30.2m on brand conversions 
with 63 pubs successfully converted to more suitable brands within the 
combined Greene King portfolio. The average sales uplift for these pubs 
is over 30%. Looking ahead, we expect to make annual investments of 
£30m to £40m in brand conversions between FY18 and FY20.
Community
We raised over £800,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support over the year 
and, in May, the company reached a new fundraising milestone, having raised 
over £3m for the charity over our five-year partnership. Greene King will 
now embark on its ‘Miles for Macmillan’ campaign, in which the company’s 
44,000 team members and its guests are invited to walk, run, bike or swim 
enough miles to reach the moon. The impressive feat will see them cover 
a combined quarter of a million miles, taking part in marathons, a London 
to Paris bike ride in July and a climb of Mount Kilimanjaro in October. 
Last year, we announced our partnership with The Prince’s Trust, launching 
a new scheme giving unemployed young people an opportunity to develop 
skills in the hospitality sector, achieve accredited hospitality qualifications 
and apply for an internship at the group. Nine programmes were completed 
this year, with 103 young people taking part and 49 offers of permanent 
employment made. 
We also made a donation of £15,000 to Pub is The Hub’s Community 
Services Fund in order to help support rural pubs that want to diversify 
their services for the benefit of their communities. This is the fourth year 
we have given to the fund, bringing the total donated to £60,000.
Current trading 
In the first eight weeks of the year, Pub Company trading has been in 
line with our expectations, bearing in mind the tough comparatives from 
last year. Pub Partners has seen a slower start to the year but this was 
anticipated as we start to annualise the benefits from the Spirit integration. 
Brewing & Brands has returned to OBV growth with a strong start to 
the year in the take home, free trade and export channels.
