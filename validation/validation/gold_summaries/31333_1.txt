profitable returns, leveraging 
our intellectual property and 
know-how with low capital

Strategic review
Xeros develops polymer based technologies which radically 
improve the sustainability, performance and economics 
of water intensive processes, dramatically reducing water, 
chemistry, energy and effluent whilst either meeting or 
exceeding the conventional quality standards for the materials 
being processed.
We have established that our technologies can deliver these 
benefits in three world-scale industries: cleaning, tanning and 
textiles. We are now progressively commercialising applications 
in these sectors to generate profitable returns, leveraging 
our intellectual property and know-how with low capital 
requirements.
Given the scale of the markets in which we operate, our 
strategy is to commercialise our technology with partners 
who already have strong international market positions and 
who also demonstrate a strategic intent to deliver increased 
levels of sustainability. The disruptive nature of our technology 
enables the creation of new high value-added business models 
and revenue streams. Where necessary, we enter markets 
ourselves to prove out our propositions so that our prospective 
partners benefit from materially lower risk profiles when they 
join us in the commercialisation process.
In order to accelerate the adoption of our technology, we have 
increased and aligned our resources to each of the application 
areas that we are pursuing with the vast majority being applied 
to those with nearer term profitability. Commercialisation is 
in progress in our Cleaning Technologies business with Hotel 
& Lodging and High Performance Workwear business units 
generating revenue of £2.0m and £0.2m respectively. We are 
targeting Tanning Technologies to deliver its first revenues in 
2018 with Textile Technologies revenues in 2019, once scale 
trials have been completed.
Having proven the scale and the quantum of the economic 
improvements of many of our applications, we are now 
organised to generate revenues where the time horizons 
for generating significant income from our investments are 
increasingly in the near term.
In December, we raised £25m before fees in an oversubscribed 
placing to accelerate the commercialisation of our application 
portfolio and to achieve specific commercial milestones in 
each of our businesses, thereby giving a clear line of sight to 
monetisation of our intellectual property portfolio. The Group 
expects to raise further funds in 2018 for the execution of 
specific commercialisation strategies.
Chief Executive Officer’s review
09 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Operating review
Cleaning Technologies
High Performance Workwear
Having extensively trialled our technology in the high added 
value Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) market during 
2017, we entered this market with the acquisition of Marken 
PPE Restoration’s operations in Nevada in July 2017. Turnover 
for the five months ended December 2017 totalled £0.2m. This 
was an initial step in our aim to create a nation-wide network 
which will enable us to serve the US firefighter market. We have 
since acquired our second and third sites in Atlanta and Miami 
through the acquisition of the trade and assets of Gloves Inc. 
in March 2018 and are targeting to open two more by the end 
of the current year. Our target is to have a total of five sites by 
the end of 2018 with full national coverage of the US achieved 
by the end of 2019.
The US firefighter PPE market is a specialist market for the 
cleaning, inspection and repair of uniforms and is valued at 
approximately $330m p.a. With 1.1m firefighters in the US, there 
are 350,000 professional firefighters based in approximately 
8,000 fire crews. Nearly 40% of these professional firefighters 
are based within 100 miles of one of the top 10 major US 
metropolitan areas. Each professional firefighter has, on 
average, two sets of bespoke turnout gear.
Once our network in the US is completed, we believe we will 
create a valuable proprietary asset which can be leveraged 
to bring our technology to PPE markets on a global basis. 
The PPE market spans many additional sub-segments 
including petrochemicals, mining, military and transportation, 
many of which are becoming increasingly aware of the adverse 
and potentially dangerous effects of incorrectly or insufficiently 
cleaned workwear. In the transportation sector, we increased 
the footprint of machines in France cleaning the PPE of SNCF’s 
workers to six by the end of December 2017.
The ability of Xeros’ technology to significantly outperform 
conventional cleaning technologies, coupled with major cost 
savings from extending the life of expensive PPE garments, 
puts Xeros in a unique position to create high added value for 
our customers and our shareholders.
Domestic Laundry
During 2017, we developed a new solution called the XDrum
TM 
to simply and inexpensively incorporate Xeros’ cleaning 
technology inside a domestic washing machine. Similar 
to High Performance Workwear, we have demonstrated 
that Xeros’ technology can improve cleaning results whilst 
simultaneously making garments look better for longer. 
In so doing, we have the capacity to provide consumers 
with washing outcomes which are better, cheaper and 
more environmentally friendly than conventional washing 
machine technology.
We unveiled the XDrum
TM
 technology at the Consumer 
Electronics Show (“CES”) in January 2018, following which we 
have entered into structured discussions with a number of 
major OEMs with the objective of licensing our technology.
In response to the increasing amounts of micro-plastic 
pollution from synthetic fibres in fabrics and garments that 
are released when they are washed, Xeros also unveiled its 
proprietary XFiltra
TM
 technology at CES. The Company expects 
regulatory authorities across the world to increasingly demand 
that OEMs place such filters in their washing machines to 
reduce the micro-plastic pollution. 
Xeros’ XFiltra
TM
 is a novel, simple, low cost solution to meet 
this need. A licensing process similar to that of XDrum
TM
 
is being developed as a potential revenue stream.
The estimated global market size for domestic washing 
machines in 2015 was 119m units including 57m units sold 
in China.
Hotel & Lodging
We entered the US market in 2013 with our own brand 
machines and an ‘all requirements’ multi-year contract 
package, which was sold and delivered by our own staff in 
combination with ‘Forward Channel Partners’. In 2017, we 
initiated a plan to transition to a business model whereby 
major market incumbents incorporate and sell our proprietary 
technology in exchange for royalties.
To this end we announced Symphony Project in April 2017 and 
demonstrated a leading conventional branded commercial 
size washing machine with Xeros’ technology inside at the 
Clean Show in Las Vegas in June. Following this demonstration, 
we are currently working with two major OEMs on the testing 
and validation of Xeros’ technology inside their own branded 
machines. The objective being to have these companies 
marketing, selling and servicing machines incorporating Xeros’ 
technology through their own well-established channels.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Xeros Technology Group plc Simultaneously, we have signed agreements with Forward 
Channel Partners in Australia, UAE and South Africa, who 
will market, sell and provide the full set of services for Xeros 
enabled machines. A number of additional opportunities 
in high water shortage/price countries are in the pipeline. 
We have adopted a similar approach in the US with a high 
focus on metropolitan areas with acute water shortages. This 
targeted approach to the US market will be with a reduced 
direct sales and service force and with focused Forward 
Channel Partners.
Having validated the value and benefits of our technology in 
the years since our market entry, the new model to which we 
are migrating will enable broader market penetration of our 
technology but with lower capital intensity for Xeros, both in 
operational and financial terms; the savings being redeployed 
to commercialise our other applications.
The Information Technology solutions required to implement 
the new commercialisation model met major milestones 
during the year, with the release of the XConnect
TM
 online 
portal. The portal provides complete operational, financial and 
sustainability information with which to manage and optimise 
on-premise laundries.
As part of our strategy to commercialise our technologies 
in China, the Company joined the UK Department of 
International Trade’s mission to exhibit the country’s best 
advanced manufacturing and innovation companies at the 
International Industrial Fair in Shanghai in November 2017. 
Xeros was selected to participate alongside major UK brands 
and technologies including Jaguar Land Rover, Dyson, McLaren 
and The Graphene Institute. Xeros is now actively developing 
opportunities for the licensing of its Cleaning Technologies 
in China.
In October 2017, we started to implement the relocation of all 
our US operations (excluding High Performance Workwear) 
into a new facility in Providence, Rhode Island. It was 
commissioned in March 2018. The facility, which benefits 
from favourable tax incentives, will consolidate four office 
and warehouse locations and result in cost savings.
Additional measures taken to increase penetration of 
the market included commercialising, at scale, our 16kg 
commercial washing machine to supplement our 25kg version. 
The first trial units were delivered to US customers in late 2016, 
with 88 commissioned by the end of 2017.
Including both our 25kg and 16kg machine options, the total 
number of machines commissioned and generating revenue 
grew by 169 during the year commencing 1 January 2017 to 
a total of 381 at the end of December 2017.
Our plan in this application is for Xeros to make a financial 
return on its intellectual property and know-how with 
relatively low capital intensity. Our target is that by the end 
of 2020, a machine incorporating Xeros’ technology will 
be commissioned every working hour, with each providing 
a royalty to Xeros.
Tanning Technologies
As of the end of March 2018, our tanning team have processed 
over 2,300 hides in trials in the Retanning and Dyeing phases 
of the tanning process with multiple tanneries. Production 
scale trials have proven that our technology works for all hide 
applications, including auto and shoe leather, and in the 
different drum types used in their production irrespective 
of their construction material. 
As of the end of March 2018, we have designed the 
engineering solutions required to introduce our polymers 
into the tanning process, manage them during the cycle, 
and then remove them from hides before their reuse. These 
developments are a significant step forward for transitioning 
tanneries from trials to contract and implementation. Under 
proposed contracts, the cost of the equipment that Xeros 
would supply would be reimbursed, so making the business 
one of low capital intensity for the Group.
Our business model for this industry is one of sharing gains 
with customers under long-term contracts. This has been 
validated by the contract signed with Wollsdorf Leder in 
July 2017 and in other ongoing commercial negotiations. 
We await a start date for implementing our engineering 
solutions in Wollsdorf. Following customer acceptance of 
our engineering solutions, revenue will be generated.
We are currently focused on commercialising our technology 
in the Retanning and Dyeing stages which use large volumes 
of water to apply specialty chemicals. In due course, we will 
also move upstream to the Tanning stages of the process 
which typically uses proportionately more water to apply bulk 
chemicals. 
We estimate that 300 million bovine hides are tanned per 
annum and we target to be applying our technology to up 
to 20% of this market by the end of 2022.
Textile Technologies
During 2017, we ratified our mid-2016 decision to include 
textiles applications within our commercialisation plans due to 
the scale of the global textiles industry and the very significant 
water and chemistry usage within the industry. We have 
now successfully demonstrated that Xeros’ technology has 
the capacity to deliver water, chemistry, energy and effluent 
reductions which at least match performance outcomes in 
our other selected applications. 
We are achieving these results in Denim Finishing and 
Garment Dyeing with reductions in chemical and water 
consumption of up to 70%, initially in lab scale trials but now 
also increasingly at larger scale. In the case of Denim Finishing, 
we have also achieved significant reductions in cycle time.
We have the capacity to dramatically reduce 
water, chemistry, energy and effluent whilst 
either meeting or exceeding the conventional 
quality standards.
11 Xeros Technology Group plc Report for the period ending 31 December 2017 Our scale trials have been conducted in our Technology Centre 
using adapted commercial size washing machines which are 
equivalent to the engineered solutions used in the industry.
We have concurrently been working on filing IP on our 
inventions on these applications with four applications made 
across both areas. With this protection in place, we anticipate 
moving to scale trials and development agreements with 
major manufacturers in the near term.
Xeros’ solutions in these applications offer manufacturers 
the resource and pollution reductions that consumers and 
governments are demanding. One example being the plan 
for “Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals by 2020” which 
has 23 global clothing brands as signatories. 
This is a sizable opportunity for Xeros, with 22.7 million tonnes 
of natural fibres processed annually for the clothing and textiles 
industries, a third of those in China.
Polymer Technologies
During 2017 we completed the polymer developments 
necessary to begin commercialisation of all our present 
applications in Cleaning, Tanning and Textiles. In Cleaning 
Technologies, we use the cleaning properties of nylon 
polymers which are supplied by our global partner, BASF, 
under a multi-year agreement through to 2021. Polypropylene, 
which is broadly available on a global basis, is used for all our 
Tanning and Textiles applications. 
Our polymer science team continues to work on developing 
“Generation Three” polymers which use novel surface effects 
with the objective of delivering further major reductions in 
process inputs or improvements in our Cleaning Technologies. 
We are currently scaling these developments up at lab scale 
and in the event they are successful, we anticipate these 
improvements being introduced within a two year timeframe.
All our novel polymer and engineering developments are 
underpinned by Intellectual Property and in the 15 months to 
the end of March 2018 we increased our ‘pending’ or ‘granted’ 
patent families by seven to a total of 48. A number of these 
filings have the benefit of significantly extending the time 
horizon of the protection of our applications.
Outlook 
With the development of our Cleaning and Tanning 
Technologies materially completed during 2017, Xeros is now 
focused on their commercialisation. The proven sustainability, 
performance and economic benefits of our technologies 
have become increasingly understood and accepted by both 
consumers and those who serve them. They are attracting a 
number of major industry players to the table. We look forward 
to reaching formal agreements in the current year. 
The results from our Textiles programme are as material as 
those in Cleaning and Tanning. They indicate that we have 
the capacity to substantially improve the long-term viability 
of another global industry, which is currently under extreme 
pressure to reduce its environmental impact. We anticipate 
demonstrating these technologies at scale with manufacturers 
in the current year.
All of the commercialisation models for our applications are 
IP-rich and capital-light with our physical participation in the 
supply chain only undertaken at an early stage, when there is 
a need to prove out and de-risk our technologies for current 
market incumbents.
In December 2017 we raised £25m, before fees, from both 
existing and new investors to fund the business through to 
the realisation of significant commercial milestones by the end 
of 2018. In each of our businesses we have a clear strategy to 
achieve commercial inflection points in 2018 which will allow 
future monetisation of these businesses. With development 
work materially completed in 2017 and the foundations for 
commercialisation put in place, Xeros’ costs will remain fixed 
whilst revenues increase from licensing and other low capital 
intensity models.
Overall, the Group is trading in line with the Board’s 
expectations.
