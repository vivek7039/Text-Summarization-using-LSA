4 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 Q&A
with David Atkins
2014 has been a year of momentum for 
Hammerson. Our retail focus is now fully 
immersed across the business and our  
strategic investment activity has accelerated  
our future growth ambitions. Here, David  
answers some key questions.
Q
What have been the highlights for the 
business in 2014? 
A
The year has been marked by a number of achievements, 
and I believe the strong numbers we have delivered  
reflect the progress we have made across the business.  
Key 2014 highlights include:
• The successful opening of Les Terrasses du Port in 
Marseille which resulted in £107 million profit on  
cost for the business. The 62,800m2 shopping and 
leisure development combines our best design and 
operational expertise and the positive response from 
consumers and retailers has been truly overwhelming, 
with over 8 million visitors to date. 
• Notable progress across our development pipeline 
with planning approval granted at Brent Cross 
Cricklewood, and at our Whitgift JV in Croydon  
and starts on site at both Victoria Gate in Leeds  
and WestQuay Watermark in Southampton.
• Securing robust shareholder support for our  
£399 million share placing. A significant portion  
of the proceeds has been deployed to acquire 
the remaining 40% of Highcross, Leicester from  
our JV partner. 
• Extending our strategic exposure to the European 
outlet sector with a £100 million investment in the 
newly created VIA Outlets venture. The 47% stake  
was financed through the share placing.
Q
How have consumer and occupier markets 
evolved over the past 12 months? 
A
A year ago we saw the first tentative signs of growing 
consumer confidence and increasing retailer demand for 
physical space. I am pleased to report that in the UK we 
have seen significant improvement over the year in retail 
sales growth which was up 2.6% across our centres. This 
momentum in consumer spending is now driving stronger 
demand from retailers for our prime retail space, which is 
starting to reflect positively in rental values. 
Importantly this story of renewed consumer growth  
and occupier demand is not just London centric. We  
have seen strong performance in our centres in major cities 
across the UK. During 2014 we signed 413 leases totalling 
179,000m² of retail space. Like-for-like net rental income for 
the year was 2.1% up on 2013 and occupancy remained 
strong at 97.5%. Despite continuing economic challenges 
in France, the success of Les Terrasses du Port indicates that 
consumer demand remains strong for the right retailing 
propositions. At Le Jeu de Paume in Beauvais we are 
encouraged by the letting progress of the development, 
with 62% already pre-let. The centre will provide 23,800m
2
 
of retailing and leisure facilities and is on track to open  
later this year. 
Q
Will your investment in the luxury and outlet 
markets continue to grow?
A
Global appetite for designer and luxury goods continues, 
with research from our Considered Consumer report 
indicating that one third of shoppers spent more on luxury 
purchases in 2014 compared with the preceding 12 month 
period. We are the only REIT with strategic exposure to  
the sector and we continue to see good growth from  
our investment in Value Retail. 
The newly created VIA Outlets venture with our partners 
Value Retail, APG and Meyer Bergman further increases  
our scale in European outlets. The newly acquired portfolio 
in major European cities has the potential to deliver  
strong returns through the combined expertise of this 
unique partnership. 
There is a clear and growing requirement for premium 
outlet space from retailers and we are enormously  
excited by the new opportunities that this opens up  
for Hammerson.

STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT CONTINUED
Q
Sustainability underpins the focus for the 
business. What have been the standout 
achievements in the past 12 months?
A
We have made significant sustainability progress during 
2014. We achieved BREEAM Excellent at Les Terrasses  
du Port, our first shopping centre development in France.  
In the UK we have been working with retail customers 
delivering much needed apprenticeships at Highcross  
in Leicester. 2014 also saw the launch of the Big Positive 
Weekend, our first national sustainability roadshow, which 
reached nine cities in over nine weekends across the  
UK portfolio. 
Q
How has the team evolved to enable the 
business to deliver strong performance?
A
During 2014 we introduced a number of new initiatives 
and targets to support our objective of promoting diversity 
and inclusion within the business. These targets are 
detailed on page 35 of the Report.
We have welcomed additional talent to the business  
with  a number of new colleagues joining the team from 
non-property backgrounds. While we are still a property 
company the business has been significantly enriched 
through the skills and knowledge of experts from different 
sectors who have bolstered our retail and digital expertise 
and provided a fresh approach. 
At the end of 2014 we opened a new office in Reading, 
which is the operational hub for the UK business. 2015 will 
see us relocate to a new head office in King’s Cross. The 
move signals a continued commitment towards our retail 
focus and, along with enhancing operational efficiency  
and reducing costs, I believe it will foster more creativity 
and collaboration across the teams.
Q
Which qualities differentiate Hammerson’s 
shopping destinations from the competition?
A
We believe the key to winning in retail property is to own 
and manage destinations which excel against each of our 
six unique areas of focus, set out on page 3 of the Report.
By applying a rigorous approach to this Product Framework, 
we ensure that our shopping centres and retail parks bring 
together the best in physical and digital retailing to offer 
consumers the most enjoyable shopping experience. 
Q
What are the business priorities and outlook 
for 2015?
A
Planning for, and the development of, major retail schemes 
in Leeds and London will continue to be a focus for the 
team in 2015. Including Croydon and Brent Cross, these 
projects will deliver over 400,000m
2
 of new retail space  
over the coming years. Our plans to redevelop the  
Whitgift Centre and Centrale in partnership with Westfield 
moved a step closer when the outline application for the 
development was formally consented in February 2014. 
Our strategic focus on the luxury sector will continue in 
2015 as we look to increase our exposure to premium 
outlets alongside our partners in the VIA Outlets venture. 
OUTLOOK 
The recovery in UK consumer sentiment has continued to strengthen 
as economic indicators have improved. With diverse regional exposure 
through our portfolio of prime retailing destinations, I believe that 
Hammerson is well-placed to benefit from this continuing trend.  
In France, the overwhelming success of our new scheme in Marseille, 
together with improving footfall figures, give us confidence that 
consumer demand remains strong for the right retail proposition. 
Despite continuing economic challenges, we expect trading in  
France to remain stable in 2015.
It is anticipated that growing demand from global investors for 
high-quality retail assets will continue in 2015, potentially compressing 
yields and boosting capital values further. Against this backdrop,  
I am confident that Hammerson will continue to deliver strong  
returns for its shareholders.
