Introduction
I am very pleased to report upon what has been a truly 
transformational year for Accsys which I believe has put 
us in an excellent position to continue to grow and take 
advantage of our unique assets.
The new Tricoya Consortium agreed on 29 March 2017, which 
will lead to the Group’s second commercial acetylation plant, 
marks a major step forward in our objective of establishing 
acetylated wood as the leading modified wood technology in 
the building materials sector.
Our focus on safety remains our top priority and during the 
year we commenced an extensive new safety awareness 
programme involving all of our employees. 
I would like to thank all of our staff for their hard work and 
continued dedication, which has helped make last year a 
truly transformational year. I would also like to welcome 
Martin Robinson, who joined our Senior Management Team 
in April 2017 as Head of Group Operations. I believe his 
wealth of experience from a career at BP will be invaluable 
during our next period of growth.

 sales growth
Total Accoya sales volume for the year ended March 2017 
increased by 18% to 39,790 cubic meters (2016: 33,847 
cubic meters) and total Accoya revenue increased by 17% 
to €50.7m (2016: €43.4m). The smaller increase in revenue 
compared to volume was attributable to the full year 
impact of sales to Rhodia Acetow (formerly Solvay Acetow) 
which are at a discount, reflecting Rhodia Acetow’s 
marketing and sales commitment and responsibility for 
their region. Excluding sales to Medite for Tricoya
®
, sales 
volumes increased by 18% to 31,532 cubic meters 
(2016: 26,789 cubic meters).
The overall increase in sales volume in the year reflects 
the continued increase in demand for our products. 
The strength of demand has reconfirmed the need for 
additional manufacturing capacity and until the additional 
capacity becomes available early next calendar year, we 
are operating at or near capacity utilisation. As a result 
we are seeking to manage demand and our customers’ 
expectations during this challenging period, during which 
we have seen an increase in forward orders. 
The increase in sales, particularly in the second half of the 
year which saw an increase of 31% compared to the same 
period the year before, continues to be very encouraging. 
We expect growth to be effected by the timing of the 
commissioning of the third reactor. We are increasingly 
focused on the longer term market and new opportunities 
expected to result from the increased capacity. We 
also expect to benefit from potential customers gaining 
greater confidence of Accoya’s enduring position in the 
market place.

26,775 2015 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21
The overall increase in sales is largely due to repeat 
business driven by the joinery industry’s need for 
high performance material, by greater acceptance 
of Accoya in our target markets as well as resulting 
from the direct activities undertaken by our sales and 
marketing teams where our resources are relatively 
limited compared to the overall market opportunity.
UK and Ireland remains our largest region, with sales 
volumes increasing by 24% to 12,021 cubic meters, 
excluding sales to Medite for Tricoya. All of this 
growth has been driven through existing distributors.
 
Over the last few years we have developed a 
successful model of working with these distributors 
to develop marketing campaigns together with 
indirect sales methods such as architect briefings 
and a detailed and on-going campaign to target and 
inform the fragmented joinery market. This success 
has led us to estimate Accoya now represents 
approximately 12% of the UK wooden window market. 
Demand was unaffected by the strengthening of the 
Euro against sterling following the Brexit vote, noting 
also that the weakening of sterling also impacted all 
timber imports. 
We sold 8,531 cubic meters to Rhodia Acetow in the 
financial year, following Rhodia Acetow assuming 
responsibility for their exclusive region in January 
2016. This represented a 17% increase compared to 
sales to customers in the equivalent region in the 
previous year. The increase masks that sales in their 
region decreased immediately following the transition 
and therefore I am very pleased that the transition has 
progressed well since with the deployment of Rhodia 
Acetow’s sales team and I look forward to further 
future growth. As a reminder, Rhodia Acetow agreed 
a five year, 76,000 cubic meter off-take agreement 
effective from January 2016, with the annual minimum 
volumes increasing each calendar year and in total 
representing approximately €100m of Accoya. 
Sales in the Americas increased by 38% to 3,846 cubic 
meters. North America in particular represents the 
largest potential market for Accoya, and I am pleased 
that the changes made to the sales team over the last 
two years has resulted in an increase in momentum 
ahead of the new manufacturing capacity becoming 
available. We will continue to focus on this region 
applying where possible the same successful sales and 
marketing techniques that we have developed in the 
UK market.
 
Sales to the Benelux area increased 10% to 3,682 
cubic meters, however sales in the Netherlands were 
disappointing, recording a decrease compared to the 
prior year. As a result, we have reviewed our approach 
to the Netherlands and have made changes to the 
sales team, launched a new marketing campaign 
and commenced a new approach to the key housing 
association market. As a result, I am confident that 
we will be in a good position to take advantage of the 
additional Accoya manufacturing capacity when it 
becomes available. 
Sales to the Asia-Pacific region decreased by 16% to 
2,812 cubic meters. Within this, sales to customers 
within Diamond Wood’s exclusive region decreased 
by 31% and sales outside of this, including to Japan, 
Australia, New Zealand and India decreased by 7%, 
reflecting several larger projects in the previous 
year, noting that we continue to believe this region 
has the potential for substantial sales growth in the 
longer term.
Sales to customers elsewhere, including Eastern 
Europe and the Middle East remain relatively small 
at this time, however we continue to develop 
relationships with distributors so as to increase 
awareness of Accoya generally, ahead of additional 
capacity becoming available and with a belief that 
many of these regions also represent excellent longer 
term markets. 
Accoya sold to Medite for the manufacture of Medite 
Tricoya increased by 17% to €7.8m (2016: €6.6m). The 
margin for this material continues to be below that 
achieved for the majority of Accoya we sell, reflecting 
our investment in the Tricoya project and that the 
current manufacturing process is in place only until 
the first dedicated Tricoya plant is operational. We 
continue to expect volumes sold to Medite for the 
manufacture of Tricoya panels to increase marginally 
in the new financial year, given temporary capacity 
limitations in Arnhem, noting that sales by Medite 
of Tricoya panels increased by 31% to 5,806 cubic 
meters in the year to 31 March 2017. 
We have 61 Accoya distributor, supply and agency 
agreements in place covering most of Europe, 
Australia, Canada, Chile, China, India, Israel, Mexico, 
Morocco, New Zealand, South Africa, parts of South-
East Asia and Middle-East and the USA.

THE CONTINUED INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS“ ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 22
Accoya

 pricing and margin
The marginally smaller increase in Accoya revenue 
(17%) compared to volume (18%) reflects a full year 
of sales to Rhodia Acetow, who receive a discount 
as a result of its obligations under the committed 
off-take agreement and to reflect the sales and 
marketing expenditure that it incurs directly. This 
was partly off-set by a small increase in prices to UK 
customers earlier in the year. A similar price increase 
to the majority of remaining customers is being 
implemented in the first half of the new financial year.
The Accoya gross margin, excluding licencing income, 
decreased from 27% to 23% as a result of full year 
impact of the Rhodia Acetow discount, the volume of 
lower margin material sold to Medite and the higher 
cost of raw wood. Part of this higher raw wood cost 
was due to an increase in prices from New Zealand 
suppliers and part was attributable to short term 
changes to the product mix used in production 
resulting from supply chain issues, but which enabled 
us to maintain production volumes. 
Expansion of Accoya manufacturing plant
I am very pleased by the progress made in the year 
in respect of our project to expand the production 
capacity of the Arnhem plant from the current levels 
of approximately 40,000 cubic meters per annum 
to 80,000 cubic meters in a two-stage expansion 
programme. We expect to invest approximately €22m 
towards the capital costs of the first stage, which 
includes the installation of a third reactor, increasing 
the capacity to 60,000 cubic meters, together with 
the back-bone infrastructure for a fourth reactor.
Work has progressed well in respect of the first 
stage of the expansion which comprises two key 
phases: the first, which involved the reconfiguring of 
chemical infrastructure stations, has been completed. 
Significant work has also been completed in respect 
of detailed engineering and ground works, and all 
key items of equipment have been ordered. The third 
reactor itself was delivered on 8 June 2017 enabling 
the remainder of the chemical construction work 
to progress. Detailed engineering is now underway 
by the Engineering, Procurement and Construction 
contractor Engie Fabricom with the construction due 
to be completed by the end of 2017 calendar year, 
ahead of a period of commissioning. 
During the year we also completed the sale and 
leaseback of the remaining freehold land in Arnhem 
to Bruil, the same group to which we sold land and 
buildings in 2011. Bruil in turn, have made excellent 
progress in the construction of a significant new 
warehouse and office facilities which will be adjacent 
to the chemical plant and are due to be completed 
in the same timeframe. These facilities, which will 
improve and contribute to better logistics and should 
improve productivity, will be leased to Accsys once 
the expansion is complete. 
The fourth reactor is expected to be added at a 
later date, as demand requires. As this will use the 
same back-bone infrastructure as is currently being 
constructed for the third reactor, it is expected to 
be added at relatively low cost, funded from internal 
resources. 
Tricoya
 
Consortium
Introduction
I was delighted that we announced in March 2017 
the completion of agreements in respect of the 
construction, operation and financing of the world’s 
first dedicated Tricoya® wood chip acetylation plant, 
to be located in Hull. Under the new agreements, 
Accsys owns 74.6% of Tricoya Technologies Limited 
which in turn owns 62% of the Hull plant. 
We have established the Tricoya Consortium to exploit 
Tricoya globally and to fund, build and operate the 
Hull plant. This is expected to have an initial capacity 
of 30,000 metric tonnes of acetylated Tricoya chips 
per annum, enough to produce approximately 40,000 
cubic meters of Tricoya panels. 
Sales of Tricoya to date have been relatively small 
scale for market development and based upon 
Accoya manufactured in Arnhem. The new plant 
will produce acetylated wood chips as feedstock 
for Tricoya panels which will be approximately 35% 
cheaper than the current market seeding production 
from Arnhem.
The total funding requirements for the Tricoya 
project are expected to be approximately €68m. 
Pre-construction engineering work was completed 
in 2016, land clearance of the plot at the Saltend 
Chemicals Park is expected to be shortly completed 
and detailed engineering work has commenced. The 
plant is expected to be completed in early 2019.

REPORT CONTINUED
“ THE HULL PLANT IS EXPECTED TO 
REACH EBITDA BREAKEVEN AT 
APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ITS CAPACITY 
AND TO TAKE APPROXIMATELY FOUR 
YEARS TO REACH FULL CAPACITY 
FOLLOWING COMPLETION." OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23
The Hull plant is expected to reach EBITDA breakeven 
at approximately 40% of its capacity and to take 
approximately four years to reach full capacity 
following completion. The designs and the plot  
allow for expansion at a later date.
Tricoya Consortium structure
The Tricoya Consortium members and funding is 
set out below.
The investment into the Tricoya Consortium has been 
split between two entities, Tricoya Technologies 
Limited (‘TTL ’) and Tricoya Ventures UK Limited 
(‘TVUK’). TVUK will own and operate the Hull plant 
and TTL will continue to exploit all Tricoya related 
intellectual property and benefit from any future 
Tricoya related revenues outside of the Hull plant.
a)  BP has been a key supplier of acetic anhydride, 
the key chemical raw material for acetylation, 
for a number of years. Under the Consortium 
arrangements, they will be the sole supplier to 
the Hull plant from its adjacent acetic anhydride 
production facility under a minimum six year 
supply agreement. 
  BP will invest a total of €20.3m, with BP Chemicals 
investing €13.7m into TVUK aligning its interest 
with the plant it is supplying. BP Ventures, BP’s 
venture capital arm, has invested €6.6m into TTL 
to benefit from the long term Tricoya opportunity. 
b)  Medite, part of the Coillte group, has been working 
with Accsys on Tricoya since 2009 and has been 
successfully selling Tricoya panels since 2012. Sales 
to date exceed 17,200 cubic meters.
  Medite has agreed an off-take agreement which 
includes a minimum obligation to purchase 20% of 
the plant capacity in the first year of production, 
ramping up to 40% after the fourth year of 
production. 
  Medite will invest €11m of equity into the Tricoya 
Consortium, with €7m having been invested 
into TTL in the year and €4m to be invested 
in total into TVUK, aligning its interests with 
the manufacturing and longer term success of 
Tricoya. 
c)  Accsys has contributed all of the Tricoya 
intellectual property and work undertaken 
previously, which has been attributed a pre-money 
value of €35m under the Tricoya Consortium 
arrangements. 
  In addition, Accsys has contributed €18.4m of 
equity into TTL, which was achieved by issuance 
of €18.9m of Loan Notes to the Business  
Growth Fund and Volantis, details of which  
are set out below.
  Together the pre-money value and cash 
investment has resulted in Accsys retaining a 
74.6% equity interest in TTL and therefore Accsys 
has continued to control and fully consolidate TTL, 
and in turn TVUK.
d)  Business Growth Fund (‘BGF’) and Volantis have 
invested a total of €22m as financial investors.
 
  BGF and Volantis have in aggregate subscribed 
for a total of €18.9m of Loan Notes in Accsys 
Technologies PLC (the ‘Loan Notes’). In  
turn, €18.4m of the proceeds, after fees, has  
been invested by Accsys as equity into TTL,  
as described above. The Loan Notes are  
unsecured and with no interest repayments  
due until January 2019.
  In addition BGF and Volantis have invested a total 
of €3.2m directly as equity into TTL.
 
As part of the 
overall financing package (which has been divided 
65%/35% between BGF and Volantis respectively), 
BGF and Volantis have also been granted options 
over 14% of the issued share capital of Accsys.
In addition, the Tricoya Consortium has agreed a six 
year, €17.2m (€15m net) finance facility with The Royal 
Bank of Scotland (‘RBS’). Interest payments due 
under the facility are rolled up until the Hull plant is 
expected to be cash-flow generative.
Global exploitation 
TTL has granted TVUK a sub-licence to 
manufacture Tricoya at the Hull plant and sell the 
same on an exclusive basis in the UK and non-
exclusive basis in certain other countries (the 
‘Production Licence’), but only when customers 
have also first entered into a licence agreement 
with TTL for the use of Tricoya in the production 
and marketing of panels (the ‘User Licence’). 
TTL will therefore receive up-front licence fees and 
ongoing royalties from TVUK under the Production 
Licence as well as royalties under the User Licence 
from third party customers buying Tricoya chips 
from TVUK. 
TTL is expected to agree additional licence 
agreements in the future elsewhere in the world to 
exploit the market which is believed to be in excess of 
1.6 million cubic meters per annum.  ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 24

“ THE NEW FINANCIAL YEAR HAS 
STARTED WELL, WITH ACCOYA
®
 SALES 
GROWTH COMPARABLE TO THE SECOND 
HALF OF THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR“
Intellectual Property 
We continue to focus on and invest heavily in the 
generation and protection of intellectual property 
relating to the innovation associated with our 
acetylation processes and products to ensure 
ongoing differentiation and competitive advantage 
in the market place. Whilst each new innovation is 
carefully considered, patenting and/or maintaining 
valuable know-how as a trade secret remains 
the typical route through which our innovation 
is protected. 
Accsys has an extensive and growing patent 
portfolio with over 60 granted patents in various 
countries throughout the world and over 170 
pending patent applications across more than 20 
patent families covering all major markets, with 
particular emphasis having recently been placed on 
extending the geographic spread of the Tricoya® 
patent portfolio. Significant R&D resources are 
employed to maximise the scope of our patent 
rights to not only cover the products we and our 
distributors and licensees sell, and the processes by 
which these products are made, but also to prevent 
competitors from commercialising similar products 
and processes.
Management of Company know-how remains an 
essential element of safeguarding our innovation, 
with confidentiality protocols in place to prevent 
unauthorised access to such know-how and to 
place strict contractual obligations on third parties 
collaborating with Accsys. Increasing Company-
wide awareness of the importance of protecting 
and controlling our know-how is a key initiative 
with particular focus on minimising risks when 
collaborating with third parties.
Our well established trademark portfolio continues 
to grow geographically and covers the key distinctive 
brands Accoya, Tricoya and the Trimarque Device 
under which products are marketed, alongside the 
corporate Accsys brand, including transliterations 
in Dutch, Arabic, Chinese and Japanese. All of our 
key brands have now been registered in over 50 
countries, and have become valuable household 
names in the timber and panel industries.
Accsys continues to maintain an active watch on the 
commercial and IP activity of third parties to monitor 
and take actions if its IP rights are being infringed, 
to identify potentially valuable third party IP which 
could be exploited via a strategic alliance, in-licence 
or purchase of third party IP and to obtain an early 
insight into third party IP which could potentially 
hinder our proposed commercial activity.
Both the patent and trademark portfolios, together 
with other protected IP, including material under 
copyright and domain names, continue to be 
regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with the 
Company objectives and to confirm obligations to 
licensees are being fulfilled. 
Careful IP management, effected via our qualified in-
house IP manager working in close conjunction with 
our technology, engineering, product development, 
marketing and commercial groups, and supported 
where appropriate by external patent and trademark 
attorneys, ensures our IP portfolio is not only 
maintained and protected, but is grown in a cost 
effective manner, adding value to our manufacturing 
and licensing businesses.  
Outlook
The creation of the Tricoya Consortium and 
expansion of the plant in the Netherlands are both 
substantial and hugely exciting projects for Accsys. 
In total, they will enable the Accsys Group to grow 
significantly over the next few years to meet the 
increasing demand for Tricoya and Accoya, which 
we continue to believe, having undertaken detailed 
market assessments, is in excess of 2.6 million cubic 
meters per annum.
The new financial year has started well, with Accoya 
sales growth comparable to the second half of 
the last financial year, although growth will be 
temporarily constrained as the year progresses now 
that we will be operating at or near our capacity. 
Our immediate focus is therefore on ensuring the 
expansion in Arnhem is completed and in this 
respect, we continue to expect the construction 
to be completed by the end of 2017 calendar year. 
Following a period of commissioning, we expect 
the full benefit of the expansion to be obtained in 
the financial year ending March 2019, with demand 
expected to result in further sales growth.
