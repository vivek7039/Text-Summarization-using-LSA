 Chairman’s statement
The expertise of our people is in high 
demand as customers look for innovative 
ways to defeat new threats to security.
 “Achieving our ambition of 
becoming the chosen partner 
requires a relentless focus 
on meeting the needs of our 
customers both in our home 
markets and overseas.”
Mark Elliott
Non-executive Chairman
Context 
FY17 will be remembered as the year in which many 
of the world’s most newsworthy events were influenced 
by the challenges being created by globalisation and 
a marked return to national politics. Over the summer, I 
engaged in discussions with Non-executive Directors of 
other companies listed on the London Stock Exchange 
about the risks and opportunities presented by Brexit. 
In the United States, where I have spent much of my 
working life, some of the political and economic 
conventions that have been in place for many years 
are being challenged and the Board and I are working 
closely with QinetiQ’s US leadership team to ensure 
that we are responding effectively to the new realities.
In defence and security, we are seeing increasing 
complexity with nations facing multiple global 
threats from both state and non-state actors. In 
this environment, QinetiQ continues to play a vital 
role making connections between technologies, 
across supply chains and internationally to support 
government customers with the rapid development 
of new capabilities to combat these threats. 
In April 2015, we appointed Steve Wadey as CEO of 
QinetiQ. Steve has significant defence sector experience 
and is implementing a strategy to deliver sustainable 
growth founded on a thorough understanding of 
the dynamics in our markets and the needs of our 
customers now and in the future. The Board and I 
are encouraged by the progress that is being made 
by Steve and his leadership team, and the momentum 
that is clearly building in the implementation of our 
strategic priorities.
Performance
In the year to 31 March 2017, we delivered increased 
orders, revenue and profit. We will continue to prioritise 
the delivery of sustainable growth with ongoing capital 
discipline as key elements of QinetiQ’s investment case. 
New CFO 
On 1 March 2017, the Board was delighted to welcome 
David Smith as Chief Financial Officer, following an 
extensive blue-chip career as CFO of both Rolls-Royce 
and of the technology group Edwards, and as CEO of 
Jaguar Land Rover. Our previous CFO David Mellors 
left QinetiQ at the end of 2016 to join Cobham plc. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank David 
Mellors for his contribution to QinetiQ; he drove 
a significant strengthening of the balance sheet 
providing a solid foundation for our future growth. 
We would also like to thank Dr Malcolm Coffin, 
QinetiQ Group Financial Controller, who assumed 
the CFO role on an interim basis.
4 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategy
Over the last 18 months, Steve and his executive team 
led an Integrated Strategic Business Planning process, 
which was thoroughly discussed in a two-day meeting 
with the Board. In addition to this active involvement 
in the development of future strategy, the Board 
also ensures the effective scrutiny of mergers and 
acquisitions. In FY17, the Group completed the purchase 
of two businesses to support our strategy, Meggitt 
Target Systems in the UK and Canada, and RubiKon 
Group in Australia, its first significant acquisitions since 
2008. I would like to add my personal welcome to the 
employees of these two companies and wish them 
many rewarding years as part of the QinetiQ Group. 
With a significant amount of activity under way to drive 
growth in the UK, in international markets and through 
innovation, the Board is undertaking ‘deep dives’ into 
a number of topics to monitor delivery of the strategy. 
These deep dives are scheduled throughout the year 
with relevant members of QinetiQ’s executive team 
and papers are submitted in advance so the focus 
is on two-way discussion rather than presentations. 
Topics scheduled for FY18 include those related to 
our strategic priorities, progress of the transformation 
of the Company, and focus on our key stakeholders 
– customers, employees and shareholders. 
Governance
In addition to the implementation of the Group’s strategy 
for sustainable growth, an ongoing priority for the Board 
is strong governance and the effective stewardship of 
the Company. During the year, Board members visited 
a number of sites including QinetiQ North America 
in Waltham, MA, and MOD Boscombe Down, where 
a number of activities associated with the Group’s 
strategic priority to modernise UK test and evaluation 
are currently under way. These visits provided the 
opportunity to see at first-hand how we are 
implementing strategy and managing risk.
Employees
The visits have also provided the opportunity to spend 
time with a number of our employees. I never fail to 
be impressed by our scientists and engineers, whose 
expertise is in high demand as customers look for 
innovative ways to defeat new threats to security. 
I’d like to thank all of our employees for their 
ongoing dedication to our customers.
The knowledge and skills of our people are at the 
heart of our business and so development of our 
talent is a vital investment. Equally important is the 
ongoing commitment to the next generation through 
offering apprenticeships and graduate schemes 
and outreach programmes with our local schools. 
Across the Group, our employees have done what they 
do best: acting with integrity, working collaboratively 
and focusing on performance for the benefit of our 
customers – three values that underpin the way we 
work at QinetiQ. We know it’s not just what we do that 
is important but how we do it. In FY18, the Board is 
committing more time to consider how we want our 
culture to evolve to deliver our vision and strategy, how 
we nurture that culture and how our transformation 
can contribute. 
QinetiQ’s leaders play a vital role of delivering day-to-day 
operational performance and driving change. Steve’s 
first decision as CEO was to establish a Leadership 
Community at QinetiQ and bring together the top 100 
leaders every month. Non-executive Directors have 
attended these Leadership Community events during 
the year, contributing to workshops and witnessing how 
leaders are driving the future direction of the Company. 
We will continue to focus on leadership and succession 
planning in FY18.
Customers
Achieving our ambition of becoming the chosen partner 
requires a relentless focus on meeting the needs of our 
customers both in our home markets and overseas. To 
achieve this, we are establishing productive partnerships 
with others – from the largest global companies to 
small businesses and universities – and aim to be open 
and professional in our relationships with our supply 
chain, basing them firmly on mutual respect. 
Shareholders
Along with employees and customers, shareholders 
are key stakeholders in QinetiQ as the owners of the 
Company. This year, Michael Harper, Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
has consulted shareholders about the new remuneration 
policy to ensure it is aligned to their interests. We also 
enjoyed a constructive dialogue with investors during 
the CFO transition, with a number of them meeting 
David Smith before he joined. We would like to thank 
our investors for their continued support.
Capital allocation
Unlocking QinetiQ’s potential requires focused 
investment in growth coupled with continued capital 
discipline to ensure growing, sustainable returns. In 
recognition of this, our priorities for capital allocation 
are: organic investment complemented by bolt-on 
acquisitions where there is a strong strategic fit; the 
maintenance of balance sheet strength; a progressive 
dividend; and the return of excess cash to shareholders.
Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of 4.0p per 
share for the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: 3.8p), 
making the full year dividend 6.0p (2016: 5.7p). 
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 1 September 2017 
to shareholders on the register at 4 August 2017. 
The full year dividend represents an increase of 5%, 
reflecting our commitment to a progressive dividend. 
Finally, I would like to thank Board members for their 
ongoing counsel. I value their considerable experience 
and the significant contribution that they have made 
this year.
