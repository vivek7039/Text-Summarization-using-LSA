 am pleased to report that the 
Group delivered a positive Adjusted 
EBITDA of £0.8m for 2017 (2016: 
£2m loss). This was achieved in part through 
significant cost reductions primarily in Social 
Publishing, and our rationalisation in overall 
marketing.
The Group’s strategy of disposing of non-core 
assets, and concentrating on delivering 
operating profit in its two main business 
units, has resulted in the Group ending 2017 
in a much stronger position than the previous 
year. Following this strategy, we sold our  
non-core affiliate business for £2.4m in 
March 2018.
We were able to grow Real Money Gaming 
revenue by 5% to £22.7m during the year 
(2016: £21.5m). This was achieved through 
operational improvements including player 
management, where bonus costs reduced  
to circa 26% of Gross Gaming Revenue  
(2016: 29%), and despite a 17% reduction  
in marketing costs. 
The UK Real Money Gaming market has 
been challenging, with a great deal of new 
regulation to contend with as well as adverse 
changes in Point of Consumption tax. It 
would therefore be remiss of me not to 
emphasise the adverse effect that increased 
Government regulation has had on our UK 
Real Money Gaming business. Implementing 
changes to comply with the various laws 
incurs one off costs where it involves changes 
to our platforms and software, and recurring 
daily costs where it affects the operation of 
the sites. This has put pressure on margins 
throughout the last two years. On 17 May 
2018, the Government announced that it 
proposes to reduce the permitted maximum 
allowed stake on Fixed Odds Terminals in 
betting shops to £2 from the current £100. 
Due to the resulting loss of tax revenue, 
the Government also announced that 
Remote Gaming Duty will be raised at the 
next Budget in November 2018 in order to 
balance the budget. This makes it likely that 
there will be a further rise in the rate of Point 
of Consumption tax.
The Group’s strategy of disposing of non-core assets, and 
concentrating on delivering operating profit in its two  
main business units, has resulted in the Group ending  
2017 in a much stronger position than the previous year.

Chairman’s Statement
Delivering growth
I
We had a significant year in Social Publishing, 
with a reorganisation of the business and a 
substantial reduction in costs of circa £3m on 
an annualised basis. This was accompanied by 
a reduction of 45% in marketing expenditure 
which resulted in a reduction of 13%  
in revenues to £6.9m (2016: £7.9m),  
whilst reducing losses by 97% to £0.1m  
(2016: £1.8m). 
We continued to execute synergies and 
leverage Slingo across our business. For 
example we took Slingo Originals games 
produced in our studio in London for real 
money, and offered these through our 
Slingo Arcade mobile app. These synergies 
helped take our Social Publishing business to 
profitability in H2 2017. Given these positive 
results, we have refocused our social growth 
exclusively through development of the 
Slingo Arcade app on which we will publish 
Slingo Originals content.
With the increase in our library of proprietary 
games, we are developing high margin 
revenue opportunities in game content 
licensing. We launched into the New 
Jersey, USA market in H2 2017, going live 
with Caesers Interactive, Resorts Digital 
Gaming and Rush Street Interactive. Our 
game licensing in New Jersey has grown 
in Q1 2018, with the addition of Golden 
Nugget and Pala Interactive. In March 2018, 
GGR from our games accounted for over 
3% of the total New Jersey online casino 
market. Currently we have 9 games live 
in that market, with a pipeline of content 
to be produced for Real Money Gaming to 
distribute with existing and new partners 
during the current year.

Sale of non-core  
affiliate business
In December 2017, the Group entered into a 
10-year framework services agreement with 
the Jackpotjoy Group, under which we will 
supply various real money gaming services 
including the licensing of Slingo Originals 
content. The Company also signed a separate 
agreement to build Jackpothappy as a white 
label site on the Gaming Realms proprietary 
platform.
As part of the arrangements between the 
two companies, the Jackpotjoy Group 
entered into a £3.5m secured convertible 
loan agreement with the Company full  
details of which are given later in this  
Report and Accounts.
In summary, the Group has delivered an 
annual positive Adjusted EBITDA for the 
first time, significantly reduced run rate 
costs, has achieved a break-even position 
in Social Publishing, and is licensing games 
into New Jersey and Europe via its RGS. This 
is in addition to having a growing profitable 
UK based Real Money Gaming operation 
all leveraging our Slingo Originals games. 
Through focus on these tightly integrated 
core activities, we are now in a position to 
drive further profitable growth in the future. 
Outlook for 2018
The Board has approved the 2018 operating 
plan which is to increase top line growth 
in UK real money gaming from our Grizzly 
operating platform and continue the 
development and licensing of mobile focused 
gambling games. 
We plan to expand our presence in Europe 
and extend the recent licensing deals with 
888 and Gala Bingo with deals involving 
other large operators. Benefits flowing from 
these activities should be supplemented 
by the benefits we hope to achieve from 
the 2017 investment in development and 
integration synergies within our social 
publishing business.
Capitalising on our success in New Jersey, 
we will licence Slingo Originals to more 
operators as well as licence our content in 
other States approving real money online 
gaming such as Pennsylvania. We will also 
pursue opportunities in Columbia and one or 
more provinces in Canada. On 14 May 2018, 
the US Supreme Court announced a decision 
to reverse a ban on sports betting within the 
USA. Whilst the expansion of sports betting 
on a state by state basis will no doubt be a 
slower process than many operators would 
like, the introduction of legalised betting 
into many states is likely to be a precursor 
to other forms of regulated online gaming. 
In the longer term, it seems likely that this 
decision will enable the Company to expand 
further into the US market, and is a cause for 
some additional optimism for the future.
Based on the Company’s performance to 
date in 2018, the board believes that the 
results for the year ending 31 December 
2018 should be in line with management’s 
current expectations.
