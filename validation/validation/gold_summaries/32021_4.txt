AT A GLANCE
We have restored the historic brewhouse building and have  
installed new mash tuns as part of the ongoing modernisation 
of our infrastructure.
We acquired Village Green Restaurants Limited,  
consisting of five popular pub restaurants in mid-Kent.
We have invested £1m redeveloping the Minnis B ay Bar  
and Brasserie, Birchington, expanding the trading area  
and improving the function facilities.
The Spitfire brand has broadened its appeal thanks to a portfolio consisting of lager, gold and amber variants.
We have carried out major redevelopments at a number  
of tenanted pubs, including the Old House at Home, 
Dormansland.  |StrategicReport |  Governance |  Financial Statements |  Other Information
