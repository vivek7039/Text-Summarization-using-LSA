Chairman’s statement
It is with considerable pride that 
I share with you the notable 
achievements that have been 
key to the continued success of 
our polyhalite Project in 2017. 
First and foremost, the commencement 
of construction, in a safe and secure 
environment, has seen us take major 
strides towards our goal of first 
production in 2021. The impressive 
construction progress over the last 
12 months sits alongside several other 
key achievements which are all 
contributing towards the successful 
fulfilment of our ultimate vision: to 
become a world-class fertilizer business.
Local
At full production over 1,000 high-
skilled jobs will be created with an 
additional 1,500 jobs created in the 
supply chain. The high-skilled jobs 
we will create will also be highly 
productive and well-paid. As the 
largest private sector capital 
investment in the North, we are 
sending a clear message that the 
region is open for business and has 
the necessary skills and ability to 
deliver major infrastructure projects. 
In addition to the employment 
opportunities created, the Company 
expects that, at full production, it will 
make around £85 million in local 
payments each year and will deliver 
approximately £13 million in annual 
contributions to the Sirius Minerals 
Foundation, as well as being a 
catalyst for regeneration with the 
potential to create new economic 
clusters in the region. 
The impressive construction 
progress over the last 12 months 
sits alongside several other key 
achievements which are all 
contributing towards the successful 
fulfilment of our ultimate vision: 
to become a world-class 
fertilizer business.

PROGRESSING 
TOWARDS 
A BRIGHT FUTURE 5

National
Beyond the North East, our project 
will also bring major economic 
benefits to the UK as a whole. At 
full-scale production we are forecast 
to generate significant tax revenues 
to the national exchequer, 
strengthening the UK’s fiscal position 
and supporting public services. The 
Woodsmith Mine and associated 
infrastructure will enable us to 
produce and sell up to 20 million 
tonnes per annum of our primary 
product, POLY4. 
Having been associated with 
significant mining projects for a large 
part of my career, I take great comfort 
that this expected success of our 
business goes well beyond the 
investment proposition. The efforts of 
our team and supporters are already 
creating positive, tangible economic 
change in the UK and we look forward 
to doing so for many years to come.
Global
For me, it is very important that POLY4 
can contribute to easing the challenge 
of global food security. Fertilizers are 
fundamental to improving agricultural 
yields and helping to address the 
forecasted imbalance between food 
supply and demand. Global 
population is growing at a rapid rate, 
and with it, the requirement for more 
food. Unless more effective, more 
efficient and sustainable practices 
are adopted, farmers and food 
producers will struggle to bridge the 
gap between supply and demand. Our 
global research and development 
programme is demonstrating that 
POLY4 delivers greater nutrient uptake 
and improves both yield and quality on 
multiple crops in varying geographic 
conditions across the world.
Sirius’ team has already demonstrated 
their ability to deliver successful 
outcomes in the face of challenges 
others have considered overwhelming. 
In order to achieve our vision and 
ensure the potential benefits for all 
stakeholders come to fruition, the 
tenacity and determination which 
has defined our Company to date, 
will continue to stand us in good 
stead as we progress further into this 
current phase of developing our 
world-class mining operation.
2017 construction commences
After five years of exploration, 
preparation, obtaining planning 
approval and having delivered many 
significant project milestones, I am 
pleased to report that the construction 
of our North Yorkshire polyhalite 
Project is well underway.
At the Woodsmith Mine site all initial 
site works to enable the construction 
of the key infrastructure components 
are complete. The working platforms 
for the main mine shaft and MTS shaft 
were completed early to ensure shaft 
related activities could commence as 
soon as possible. 
At Lockwood Beck, initial site works 
are now complete, including the 
upgrade and repositioning of the 
existing road junction. The new junction 
provides safe entry to the site and has 
also greatly improved the access to 
the existing road infrastructure. The 
shaft sinking platform and 
associated drainage have been 
installed and the site is ready for 
shaft sinking activities to get 
underway in 2018. 
Supply agreements
Market acceptance of POLY4 in 
the form of long-term supply 
agreements, as evidenced 
through our partnership with 
leading agri-business Wilmar, 
reinforces and validates that 
POLY4 will earn its place in the 
global fertilizer market. Our 
partnership with Wilmar enables 
access to key markets with huge 
prospects for POLY4 across South 
East Asia. Wilmar is the latest 
addition to our existing group of 
industry leading customers with 
whom we expect to help drive 
further global demand for POLY4.
Our people
People are critical to the success of 
our business and I am particularly 
pleased with the expanding team 
of highly motivated, diverse and 
experienced individuals who have 
joined the business in 2017. The last 
year has seen our team more than 
double in size and the successful 
move in late 2017 to Resolution 
House, our new office headquarters 
in Scarborough, has provided the 
space, technology and environment 
to support our workforce.

I am particularly pleased with the 
overall quality of people who have 
joined us from the local area. To date, 
the majority of our head office team 
in Yorkshire has been sourced from 
the local labour market. I also take 
great satisfaction from the fact that 
many of our younger team members, 
who joined us as apprentices, are 
now integral members of the team. 
Our strong values of responsibility, 
ownership, belief and urgency, based 
on the solid foundations of safety and 
teamwork, have propelled the team 
to achieve more than many people 
thought would ever be possible. 
Move to the Main Market and 
Premium Listing
Following the completion of stage 1 
financing, we announced our 
intention to apply for admission to 
listing on the premium listing segment 
of the Official List of the UK Listing 
Authority (Premium Listing) and 
admission to trading on the main 
market of the London Stock Exchange 
(the Main Market). While AIM had 
provided us with an excellent 
platform to progress the Company 
through the various approval phases 
of the Project, the Company Directors 
believe that a Premium Listing better 
supports the long-term strategy and 
potential of the Company by 
providing us with a more appropriate 
platform for growth, access to broader 
international investor audiences and 
deeper pools of investment capital 
that reflect the world-class nature 
of the Project and Sirius’ long-term 
potential as a global supplier of 
multi-nutrient fertilizer. This important 
milestone was accomplished in 
April 2017 and Sirius finished 2017 
as a FTSE 250 constituent. 
Executive Director and Senior 
Non-Executive Director 
appointments
Early in 2017 we announced the 
appointment of Thomas Staley to the 
Board as Finance Director. Thomas 
played an instrumental role in 
securing the stage 1 financing and 
he will play a pivotal role in a 
successful execution of the stage 2 
debt raising. Thomas’ appointment 
adds to an already very strong 
complement of Board members who 
have the credentials and experience 
required to lead the Company through 
the next phase of development. 
We also announced the elevation of 
one of our very experienced Non-
Executive Board members, Noel 
Harwerth, to the role of Senior 
Independent Director. Noel has a 
wide array of Board experiences 
across several industries, including 
mining and finance. Over the last few 
years she has provided us with wise 
counsel on a regular basis and I am 
very pleased she has agreed to add 
this expanded role to her duties. 
 
Outlook 
2018 will be a pivotal year for us as 
we seek the remaining financing 
required to complete this 
transformational Project. The 
construction of the first new fertilizer 
mine in the UK for a generation is an 
opportunity to create thousands of 
jobs and bring significant economic 
benefits to both national and local 
economies. In order to fully realise this 
transformational opportunity for the 
UK, a partnership with the UK 
Government, in the form of a Treasury 
Guarantee under the Infrastructure 
Project Authority’s scheme, is essential.
Securing this guarantee and our 
stage 2 financing will be our core 
focus for the year ahead and I am 
comforted by our excellent progress 
made to date. With preparations well 
underway to secure commitments for 
financing, we are confident in our 
ability to deliver these goals and look 
forward to taking on the challenges 
which lie ahead. 
The short, medium and long-term 
benefits from our Project are 
significant and will not be diminished 
by Britain’s decision to leave the EU. 
I believe that our ongoing success is 
a clear demonstration of the growing 
local and national public and 
political support for realising the full 
potential of the Woodsmith Mine. 
I would like to thank all our 
shareholders, supporters and 
suppliers for their ongoing support.
Kind regards
