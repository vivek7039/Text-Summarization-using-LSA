Benefits of a genuine multi-brand 
strategy in a changing industry 
landscape
After our acquisition of Xperience Franchising and 
Whitegates in 2014, we focused on consolidation, driving 
out duplicate costs and leveraging economies of scale. 
By 2016 we had reaped the fruits of that approach; the 
combined businesses delivered £1.0m of after tax 
earnings against a net cash consideration of £5.1m.
However, EweMove is a very different proposition. It is  
a fully-functioning franchisor with its own proprietary 
technology “EweReka” sitting on an industrial scale 
platform. Its HQ staff are based in Cleckheaton,  
Bradford and culturally, it is very different from our 
traditional high street brands. Consequently, our 
intention was always to keep EweMove separate from  
our existing brands and benefit from some of its digital 
marketing expertise, without needing to fold it into  
our traditional support infrastructure.
The key to success with EweMove is to drive the numbers 
of “local representatives”, to continue to recruit 
franchisees at current levels, to encourage more 
experienced estate agents to join the brand and to 
reduce its franchisee attrition rate.
 
EweMove incurred losses in H1 trading. However with the 
departure of the founders at the end of June 2017, and 
the arrival of the new Managing Director, the business 
returned to profit in H2 trading, and, pleasingly, the 
number of franchises rose to 120 by year end. 
The online or hybrid space is very topical in the property 
industry. It has been estimated that circa £250m has 
been raised by our competitors since they launched,  
with a number of the top players becoming increasingly 
high profile.
Unlike those companies where the customer proposition 
is focused on saving commission, EweMove’s promise is 
above all to get the customer’s property sold. However, 
EweMove does share several characteristics with the 
best-known brands; it is nationally recognised, does  
not rely on high street offices, and operates 24/7 for 
customer convenience. 
A genuine multi-brand strategy is more than just a 
collection of brands. EweMove shows the clarity of our 
thinking as it gives us an exciting play in the online, 
hybrid space and hedges against deterioration in trading 
conditions for our traditional high street model. We have 
crystallised the price we paid for EweMove, which is 
relatively modest compared to the sums invested in 
competing businesses, and have management in place 
to see us through the next growth phase.
As well as progressing with EweMove we achieved 
satisfying network revenue growth at all of our traditional 
brands, Whitegates leading with 14%, CJ Hole 9%, 
Parkers 6%, Martin & Co 5% and Ellis & Co 3%. 
In 2017 we concentrated on further development  
of the six property brands which we already own, 
continuing to build upon our genuine multi-brand 
strategy which sees us invested in competing 
businesses. An important part of this was to recruit 
a new brand leadership team to see us through the 
next growth phase, which we achieved this year.

Growing and developing our  
hybrid network
EweMove provides estate agency and lettings 
services 24/7 through an integrated platform  
and a franchised network of local property experts. 
Change
2017 saw the active recruitment of experienced estate agents for 
the first time (15 recruited). At the mid-year Nick Neill took the helm 
as MD following the founders’ departure. Nick was one of the first 
franchisees and was running one of the most successful franchises. 
Not all franchisees accepted the changes but the flow of new 
franchisees attracted by the technology and ethos continued.
Progress
We have focused on the core activities, refining what worked and 
creating operational efficiencies. Losses in H1 were significantly 
offset by profits in H2; net loss £0.1m. Renewed vigour saw  
the franchise network increase to 120 franchises by year end.  
The 2 key areas of focus moving ahead are accelerated growth in  
the national footprint of local property experts and enhancing 
franchise performance.
Number of franchises
120
+25% (2016: 96)
These figures are not quoted on a “like-for-like” basis.  
In all 178 traditional brand offices grew their revenue 
year-on-year and 105 offices had static or shrinking 
revenue. We had 3 franchisees managing 800+ 
properties, 21 franchisees managing 500+ and 59 
franchisees managing 300+. The overall pattern was of 
pleasing revenue growth, in a marketplace where many 
competitors were reportedly in reverse gear. However, 
we cannot be complacent. Whilst our best franchisees 
made good progress, other franchisees found trading 
conditions difficult. Management are alive to the 
possibility that there will be both opportunities for our 
franchisees to act as consolidators at their local level, 
buying up competitor’s letting portfolios, but there will 
also be consolidation opportunities within the Group, 
with strong and capable franchisees buying out their 
weaker neighbours.
