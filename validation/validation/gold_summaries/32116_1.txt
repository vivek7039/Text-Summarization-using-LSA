 6 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
Group Chief Executive’s Statement
Strategic Report
I am very pleased to be reporting another set of strong numbers for the 
Group. In what continues to be a lively political environment, in particular 
in the UK, it has been good to see the business deliver a good year for 
Dixons Carphone both financially and operationally.
Dixons Carphone has had another strong year financially; 
Group like-for-like revenues were up 4% over the year, 
with growth in every region in the Group leading to a 
10% increase in Group headline PBT from £457 million to 
£501 million, slightly above the guidance we gave, resulting 
in an increase in headline basic EPS from 30.2p to 33.8p. 
At the same time, it is pleasing to see – across the Group 
– sustained high levels of customer satisfaction and Net 
Promoter Scores driven by our continued relentless focus 
on improving our proposition for our customers. Total 
reported profit before tax has increased by £123 million 
driven by the increase in headline EBIT and a reduction 
in year on year non-headline costs, principally those 
associated with our ‘big-box’ property plan, the costs of 
which were fully recognised in FY16.
Our business in the UK & Ireland enjoyed a good year 
despite some headwinds in particular within phone, with 
like-for-like revenues up 4% over the year and headline 
EBIT up 4% to £385 million. This sales growth was driven 
in large part by growth in electricals in a flat overall market. 
This was somewhat tempered by a more challenging phone 
sector which was impacted by product safety issues, a 
limited supply in the market of some key lines and some 
changing trends in SIM-only. Against this backdrop, the 
team have delivered good profit growth underpinned by 
solid cost control across the business. 
Over the course of the year we all but completed our 
‘big-box’ property plan, closing 80 stores, and providing 
a consistent experience with the latest categories and 
look-and-feel now right across our estate. Virtually all 
of our CurrysPCWorld stores now offer a fully-fledged 
embedded Carphone Warehouse shop-in-shop. Separately 
we have trialled a new format for our standalone Carphone 
Warehouse stores; we now have 9 open and will continue to 
open more during the course of the year. The performance 
of these stores has been highly encouraging, in particular 
for sales of accessories and insurance. In addition we have 
launched a new Carphone Warehouse web platform which 
is trading well.
Price competitiveness continues to be an area of real focus; 
our customers are – rightly – savvy, and we need to be both 
competitive and transparent - not only on the products 
themselves, but also on the cost and availability of delivery 
and services. Today, we show competitor prices on our 
websites so that customers can feel confident at all times 
that they are getting a great deal from us. We continue to 
be at parity or better versus our most aggressive pure-
play competitors on pretty much all of our products, pretty 
much all of the time and we are transparent about our 
delivery availability versus our main competitors. Our free 
app ‘Compare Prices’ is a great tool for colleagues and 
customers to check prices themselves. 
iD mobile operations in the UK continue to grow from 
strength to strength since launch in May 2015. iD allows 
us to offer highly differentiated propositions to customers, 
supported by an innovative IT platform, enabling us to tailor 
plans, for example, with the ability to transfer data between 
friends and family, as well as being at the vanguard of 
free roaming. These propositions are proving to be very 
successful and I am very pleased that the active customer 
base is now more than 600,000, making iD one of the 
fastest growing postpay MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network 
Operator) in UK mobile history.  7 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
 
Strategic Report
Multi-play has had a great year. The proposition was re-
launched and supercharged a little over a year ago and we 
have more than doubled our market share of the fixed line 
switching market. We are the only place where a customer 
can compare, discuss, choose and switch – from a wide 
choice of national providers – the broadband and TV 
package that is perfect for them, expanding the expertise 
we have developed in mobile to all telecommunications 
and TV content needs, but we will not stop there. We have 
ambitious plans for the business including our innovative 
energy switching proposition in the coming year.
Both our Dixons Travel business and Harrods Technology 
have had a very strong year, benefiting from an influx 
of visitors post the EU referendum. In Dixons Travel we 
opened new stores in Heathrow Terminal 2 and at London 
City Airport as well as in Oslo, all trading well. In Harrods, 
while sales have been good across the board the sales 
of mobile phone hardware has been particularly strong. 
While we do not expect to see the currency benefit extend 
indefinitely in these stores, we have been pleased to be able 
to take advantage of the increased demand.
Our new Team Knowhow proposition has had a promising 
start, including our Leeds and London pilots. This has 
focused initially on phone and white goods repairs and 
NPS levels have been very encouraging indeed. Repair is 
a critical first step, but we think that finance, protection 
and support and services will all be strong elements of the 
expanded proposition and we have put in place a strong 
team, led by Feilim Mackle, to drive this business forward. 
We believe passionately that customers will increasingly 
want somebody to take responsibility for keeping the 
dozens of devices and appliances in their homes working, 
always on and upgraded and that we are uniquely placed to 
do that cost-effectively and well.
Our Nordics business, against, again, a relatively tough 
market backdrop, had a very respectable year with like-
for-like revenues up 1% over the year and 2% in the fourth 
quarter, and headline EBIT increased 13% to £89 million. 
Operationally the region has delivered some positive 
improvements including the building and commissioning of 
the new small-product warehouse in Sweden, creating the 
most efficient and modern operation of its type in Europe, 
integrating InfoCare, the largest computer repair company 
in the region, developing its digital infrastructure, improving 
its online proposition and integrating the Fona business 
in Denmark. The business is also implementing electronic 
shelf-edge ticketing and a new merchandising model which 
will drive cost and stock out and improve margins.
Our Southern European business had a very good year in 
the face of ongoing political and economic turbulence and 
I am pleased it has reported Group leading 6% rise in like-
for-like revenues over the year with headline EBIT growing 
from £17 million to £22 million. I am particularly proud of 
the team in Greece; our Greek business has increased 
profitability in 2016/17 against what continues to be a tough 
operating environment on the back of continued innovation 
and vigour. In the last year the team has opened new stores, 
grown market share, radically improved delivery options 
for customers across the country and developed a new 
digital agenda including a new e-commerce platform due to 
launch in the coming year. In Spain, we have continued to 
be agile in tough, albeit improving, economic conditions. We 
continue to move to a more flexible franchise approach, and 
to pivot the model to offer multi-play, SIM-only and handset 
only, as well as gaining traction with our new SmartHouse 
proposition.
Our Connected World Services division has also had a 
good year, generating £21 million of headline EBIT, driven 
by deepening our existing partnerships. Our relationship 
with Sprint continues to evolve and we are currently in the 
process of rolling-out our IT platform, honeybee, across 
their estate. In light of very volatile US market situations 
and responding to Sprint’s desire to accelerate its own 
distribution platform we have agreed to sell our share of the 
joint venture that we built together back to them. honeybee, 
our unique software platform, continues to push forward, 
and we have signed an agreement with WebHelp, a large 
French outsourcer for our Contact Centre product.
Finally, the political sands in the UK continue to shift. We 
have, I believe, been able to manage the immediate fallout 
of the referendum result without significant issues and our 
proposition remains as competitive and attractive as ever. 
Nevertheless, we will remain vigilant as the questions arising 
out of the recent election ebb and flow and look, as always, 
to turn changes in the market to our advantage.
In short, it has been another year of strong delivery within 
the business and I feel pleased to be ending the year well-
positioned for the year ahead. I am also acutely aware that 
we are only in this position thanks to our more than 43,000 
colleagues operating in 10 countries across the Group 
and my sincere thanks go out to them all. I am constantly 
impressed by the passion and commitment of the men and 
women who make up the Dixons Carphone family, and am 
very proud to work alongside them.
