 A REVIEW OF 2017 –
CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
FINANCIAL RESULTS
2
017 was one of the most 
productive years in our history. 
We completed the integration 
of our largest-ever acquisition, 
concluded two bolt-on 
purchases and announced an important 
transaction with Tarmac Holdings 
Limited (Tarmac) that, subject to 
approval by the competition authorities, 
will see us streamline our ready-mixed 
concrete network in exchange for a 
substantial new reserve of minerals and 
a strategically valuable asphalt plant. 
This did not, however, distract us from 
our operational focus and we once again 
delivered a solid financial performance.
Group revenues for the year grew by 43 
per cent to £652.4 million and underlying 
earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) 
increased by 35 per cent to £80.4 million, 
including a full-year contribution from 
Hope Construction Materials Limited 
(Hope). This equates to an underlying 
EBIT margin of 12.3 per cent and we are 
making good progress towards our 2020 
target of 15 per cent.
Profit before tax rose by 52 per cent 
to £71.2 million and underlying basic 
earnings per share increased by 19 per 
cent to 4.14 pence. The Group continued 
to generate a healthy cash flow and, even 
after the substantial investments made 
during the year, we ended 2017 with a 
significantly stronger balance sheet than 
we entered it.
Your Group Chief Executive provides 
more details on our performance in the 
following pages.
A YEAR OF FURTHER GROWTH
We believe that what distinguishes us 
from our competitors is our willingness 
to go beyond reasonable expectations 
to deliver an exceptional service to our 
customers. This applies whether we 
are delivering a few metres of concrete 
for a garage floor, or servicing a major 
road scheme. In fact, as Breedon has 
matured, we have become increasingly 
involved in critical industrial, commercial 
and infrastructure projects which have 
demanded strategic partnerships 
with some of the country’s leading 
national companies. 
The foundations of the Group are our 
aggregates reserves and at the end of 
2017 we had around 750 million tonnes 
of mineral reserves and resources, with 
further reserves due to be added to 
our portfolio following completion of 
our planned acquisition of a number of 
quarries from Tarmac. 
We have a very straightforward mission:  
to be the safest and most profitable 
company in our industry. This ambition 
drives all our decision-making.”

Maximising the return from every 
tonne of those reserves is one of the 
keys to our success and in 2017 we 
invested a further £46 million in our 
quarries, cement plant and downstream 
operations. This has enabled us to 
open new quarries, extend existing 
operations and improve the efficiency of 
many of our sites. Once again, organic 
growth was balanced with selected 
bolt-on purchases. We invested around 
£10 million in acquisitions during 2017, 
which extended our market reach and 
added further to our reserves and 
resources. The Group now has an even 
stronger platform for growth, with a 
national presence, enhanced product 
portfolio, robust central management 
functions and an exceptionally strong 
asset base.
PROGRESS ON SAFETY
Around 2,200 colleagues now work 
in the Breedon Group and in 2017 we 
intensified our efforts to ensure that they 
all go home safely at the end of every 
working day. This took on an even greater 
importance in light of the tragically high 
number of fatalities in our industry last 
year. We maintain our ambition to be 
the safest, as well as the most profitable, 
construction materials company in the UK 
and we firmly believe that with the right 
culture of safe behaviour, Zero Harm is a 
realistic goal. I am pleased to say that the 
number of serious injuries declined last 
year, as our new Safety Commitments 
became firmly embedded in the business 
and colleagues took greater care of 
themselves and each other.
SENIOR MANAGEMENT CHANGES
Ashley Bryan stepped down as 
Managing Director of Breedon Cement 
and left the Group in early 2017, to be 
succeeded by Interim Managing Director 
Tim Billingham.
Following the departure of Tim Hall 
from the Group in September, we 
were recently joined by Mike Pearce as 
Chief Executive of Breedon Southern. 
Mike was formerly Managing Director 
of the aggregates division of Aggregate 
Industries, where he had also been 
responsible at various times for the 
company’s building products, asphalt, 
ready-mixed concrete, contracting and 
commercial activities. 
I would like to take this opportunity to 
welcome Mike to the Group and to thank 
Colin Parke for his interim leadership 
of Breedon Southern over the past 
six months.
THE BOARD
We are today announcing Simon Vivian’s 
retirement from the Board and he will be 
stepping down with immediate effect. 
Simon and I worked closely together 
on the creation of Breedon and he did 
distinguished service as the Group’s chief 
executive from 2010 to 2015. He retires 
with our thanks for the significant 
contribution he made to the Group’s early 
development and we wish him well in all 
his future endeavours. Following Simon’s 
departure, and recognising the need 
to maintain the right mix of skills and 
experience, we have commenced a 
formal search process to seek two new 
independent non-executive directors.
LOOKING AHEAD
Our business is in great shape and we 
are well positioned to benefit from the 
medium-term growth in residential and 
infrastructure development, to which the 
majority of our material is supplied.
As I have said in the past, our dividend 
policy remains constantly under review. 
We still believe that continuing to deliver 
capital growth, by reinvesting our 
resources in the organic development 
of our business and in earnings-
enhancing acquisitions, is the best way 
of rewarding our shareholders for the 
foreseeable future.
We also keep our Alternative Investment 
Market (AIM) quotation under review. 
We feel no particular pressure to transfer 
to the main market whilst AIM continues 
to provide us with a platform from 
which to pursue our growth ambitions, 
but do not rule out a full listing in the 
longer term.
I would like to thank everyone in 
Breedon, together with all our contract 
hauliers and the many companies who 
do business with us, for their continued 
enthusiastic support for the Group. I am 
particularly pleased that so many of our 
colleagues are themselves shareholders 
in Breedon, thanks in part to widespread 
participation in our Sharesave scheme.
We look to 2018 and beyond with 
confidence and optimism.
