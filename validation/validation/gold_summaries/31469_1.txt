manned security, software and systems and 
integrated security solutions
• Facilities management: including integrated 
security and FM services
• Care & Justice Services: comprising custody, 
health, transportation, care and rehabilitation 
in the UK and Australia

2017 Results highlights – core businesses
Revenues rose by 3.2% to £7.4 billion. The combination 
of growing revenues and improved productivity saw the 
Group’s adjusted earnings per share rise by 5.9% to 
17.9 pence per share. The Group generated operating 
cash flow of £527 million, equivalent to 106% of 
Adjusted PBITA in line with our guidance of a 
normalised rate of over 100%.
Since 2013, revenues from core businesses 
have grown by 17% and Adjusted EPS by  
48% while generating operating cash flow  
of £2.5 billion.
The Group’s strong cash generation has enabled 
us to invest in growth, pay dividends of more 
than £700 million and at the same time 
strengthen the Group’s financial position, 
reducing net debt/Adjusted EBITDA to 2.4x  
at the end of 2017.
Over the same period we have created 
innovative new products and services for our 
customers and we greatly improved safety 
performance for our employees.
We are continuing to invest in growth, 
technology and productivity in order to 
capitalise on our strong positions and to 
support our aim of delivering sustainable, 
profitable growth.
FOCUSED GROWTH
Chief Executive’s review
4 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 PEOPLE AND VALUES
Organisation
Over the past four years we  
have invested in sales, business 
development, technology and 
our support and control systems, 
processes and resources. We now have sufficient 
strength and depth in these areas to enable us to 
implement the next, critical phase of our organisational 
development and with effect from1 January 2018 we 
have reorganised the Group-wide management of our 
core business. The principal features of this change are:
• Creation of a Global Cash Solutions division
• Consolidation of our Secure Solutions businesses 
into four regions: Americas, Europe & Middle East, 
Africa and Asia
Our new organisation will enable us to strengthen 
further our strategic, commercial and operational focus 
in each of our core service lines. We will continue to 
build and utilise shared services for the provision of 
efficient and fit-for-purpose support functions to all 
businesses and this element of our organisational 
development has significant unrealised potential.
The biographies of the leaders of our principal 
businesses are set out on pages 70 and 71.
As outlined in the market growth section on pages 8 
and 9, technology is a growing part of our Secure 
Solutions and Cash Solutions services.
In Secure Solutions, we continue to build our 
capabilities to design and deliver integrated security 
solutions – combining people and technology to offer 
our customers more efficient and valuable security 
solutions (see pages 24 to 27). Today we have more 
than £2.45 billion technology-related security revenues.
Our integrated approach to designing and delivering 
security solutions helps us to differentiate our value 
proposition in order to win, retain and grow contracts 
with key customers.
Our new Secure Solutions organisation will enable us to 
increase collaboration and co-ordination across all of our 
markets which, in turn, will enable us to rationalise and 
target our product and business development, improve 
global account development, harmonise marketing and 
transfer operational best practices more rapidly.
Our Care & Justice Services are concentrated in the  
UK & Australia where we have significant resource  
and capability to win and deliver complex public 
services. Our focus is on rigorous pre-bid evaluation  
of contracts and operational delivery. We expect the 
overall cash generation of these services to improve as 
certain legacy contracts expire over the next 18 to 24 
months.
In our Global Cash Solutions division we have proven 
expertise in providing technology-enabled cash solutions 
and services that improve the control, ease of use and 
efficiency of our customers’ cash management. In the 
United States we have established a market-leading 
position in the provision of cash management 
technology for large format retail stores. We believe 
that our proven cash management technology and our 
people provide G4S with a substantial opportunity to 
extend and grow new products and services across  
our global markets. At the end of 2017 G4S cash 
management technology was deployed at over 19,500 
locations in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and 
Africa, an increase of more than 30% over the prior 
year. We also made progress in improving productivity 
in a number of markets and we now have plans to  
apply these improvements across all of our cash 
solutions businesses.
I am confident that our new organisation will enable 
G4S to take full advantage of the exciting growth 
opportunities in our markets and to successfully  
execute our strategy.
Our CSR approach and contribution 
to society
As a global leader in security and related services, 
corporate social responsibility is very important to G4S 
and it forms a key part of our strategy. We are trusted  
to care for some of the world’s most valuable assets  
and to ensure the safety, protection and welfare  
of people around the world, often in complex and 
demanding operating environments.
Conducting our business in a way which is ethically 
responsible, safe and consistent with the company’s 
values and standards, is an essential element of our 
business model.
The Group is committed to sustainability and the core 
principles of the UN Global Compact are reflected in  
our policies, values and business activities today.
We recognise that business has an important role in the 
achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
On page 18 of this report we highlight where G4S is 
helping to advance these goals and make a positive 
difference to society and communities around the world. 
We expect all colleagues to uphold G4S’ values in 
whatever role they play. In return, our commitment  
is to provide meaningful work, fair reward and the 
opportunity to develop. Our employees often work  
in inherently hazardous environments and we equip  
and train our employees to ensure they are as safe  
as possible.
We regularly ask stakeholders from inside and outside 
the company to provide input into an analysis of our 
material CSR issues to help set priorities. See page 83 
for more information on the CSR materiality review  
that was undertaken in 2017.
Our CSR approach covers a broad range of areas,  
with three material priorities: health and safety, human 
rights and anti-bribery and corruption.
In June 2017, G4S was selected as a constituent 
company of the FTSE4Good Index, recognising our 
strong commitment to social responsibility and 
sustainable business practices.

Culture – Embedding our values
Underpinning our culture are the Group’s values which 
govern and guide the conduct of everyone at G4S.
Employee‑communication programme
Following the launch of our values in March 2016 we 
conducted an extensive employee engagement 
programme to raise awareness and deepen understanding 
of G4S’ corporate values. We have developed a training 
programme for managers and our values are an essential 
part of induction and training for new employees. We are 
embedding our values into existing processes, governing 
all aspects of our business including sales, operations and 
performance management. Where actions are required 
– for example, an improvement in the safety performance 
of a particular business – leaders and managers will have 
specific objectives in order to make sure the actions are 
prioritised appropriately (see Key Performance Indicators 
page 32).
Speak Out
We continue to encourage colleagues to “Speak Out” if 
they are aware of behaviour which is not consistent with 
our values or policies. There are many ways in which 
colleagues can raise concerns, with supervisors or 
managers, with their local HR team or through the 
global, independent whistleblowing systems. Our case 
management system provides improved visibility of 
whistleblowing cases from across the Group, and 
provides vital information to our Group Ethics  
Steering Committee.
I believe that the conduct of the vast majority of our 
employees is consistent with our values and that this has 
been – and remains – the cornerstone of our customer 
service and commercial success. We know, however, 
that even isolated instances of poor conduct are 
unacceptable and can be very damaging. It is therefore 
important that we continue to promote good conduct 
and the use of Speak Out.
Health & Safety
The wellbeing and safety of our employees and those in  
our care remains a key priority for the Group executive 
and global leadership teams. We work in an inherently 
hazardous industry: we travel extensively and many of 
our colleagues are trained and deployed to protect our 
customers and their property. As a result, road-traffic 
accidents and criminal attacks are inherent risks we face 
in delivering some of our services. We have therefore 
invested in a sustained programme to strengthen our 
health and safety policies, practices and training 
performance across the Group with the aim of 
improving safety.
The number of road-traffic fatalities has decreased  
by 48% since 2013 when the first G4S road-safety 
programme was launched. There has also been a 
reduction in attack-related fatalities in our Cash 
Solutions businesses. However, the number of armed 
attacks has not changed and so we continue to work 
with the relevant authorities to mitigate the elevated  
risk in some of our services. Sadly, during 2017, 25 of 
our colleagues lost their lives in work-related accidents 
and attacks, compared with 47 fatalities in 2016.
Chief Executive’s review continued
Although we are pleased that there are clear signs of an 
overall cultural shift within G4S in our approach to safety we 
also know that there is more to do and our plans reflect this. 
We are firmly committed to improving our health and safety 
performance and our goal remains zero harm.
CUSTOMERS AND SERVICE 
EXCELLENCE
In both Secure Solutions and Cash 
Solutions we have been investing  
in innovative products and service 
excellence, to grow the business 
with new contracts for new and 
existing customers, and to improve customer retention, 
which averages around 90%, reflecting our exit from some 
low-margin contracts and retaining some of the Group’s 
largest contracts in 2017 – as discussed in this report.
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
Increasingly our customer offering 
includes technology in the form  
of systems and software. 
Technology-related security 
revenues were £2.45 billion 
(2016: £2.2 billion) in 2017.
Overall we won new business with an annual contract 
value of £1.4 billion and total contract value of £2.5 
billion in 2017.
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE 
AND PRODUCTIVITY
In 2017, our operational 
excellence and productivity 
programmes delivered further 
benefits, providing the Group 
with the financial flexibility to 
invest in service and product 
development as well as improving the Group’s adjusted 
profit before interest, tax and amortisation (Adjusted 
PBITA) from core businesses by 4.2% to £496 million.
With our more focused business designed around 
service delivery, there is further opportunity to 
streamline general and administrative processes and 
share resources to generate greater efficiency. The 
Secure Solutions, Global Cash Solutions and Care & 
Justice Services segments will share facilities, 
infrastructure and functional services. Our detailed  
plans will enable us to begin implementing changes  
and to realise the first phase of these benefits  
during 2018 and 2019.
One example of where we are introducing more 
streamlined processes is in our manned security business 
with a new lean-business process called “Javelin” (see 
page 29), which combines HR, operations, finance and 
back-office functions, and should ensure we schedule our 
people more efficiently and are able to reduce the time 
between when we do the work and when we bill for it, 
and provide accurate and timely management information 
to customers. Javelin was launched in Ireland in 
November 2017 and we will be commencing 
implementation in the UK during 2018.

See page 44 for the basis of results of core 
businesses and an explanation of Alternative 
Performance measures is on page 35.
FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL 
DISCIPLINE
The new capital and contract 
processes we introduced in 2013 
are helping us to apply capital  
with greater consistency and 
rigour. Strengthening our working 
capital management was also a priority for our finance 
and line management in 2017 and we have maintained 
the increased weighting of operating cash flow in our  
annual incentive plans. I am pleased to report that at  
31 December 2017, our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
had reduced to 2.4x, down from 2.8x at the end of 2016.
Portfolio programme
The portfolio programme we announced in 2013 
has materially improved our strategic focus and the 
programme is substantially complete. Since 2013 we 
have divested 41 businesses (with annual revenues  
of c.£1.3 billion and Adjusted PBITA of £46 million), 
realising gross proceeds of approximately £520 million. 
In 2017 we closed four businesses and sold a further 
nine, realising gross proceeds of £166 million.
Performance
Statutory results
Revenue growth was 3.1% and earnings per share rose 
by 18.8%. A more detailed review of the statutory 
results can be found on page 38, and a reconciliation  
to results from core businesses is provided on page 44.
Core business performance
Supported by the continuous investment in sales and 
business development resource and new technology-
enabled services, revenues rose by 3.2% to £7.4 billion. 
Consistent with the commercial practice we adopted 
several years ago, we have continued to be very 
disciplined on contract bidding and, whilst this 
constrained revenue growth in some markets, it 
underpins sustained profitable growth. The combination 
of growing revenues and improved productivity saw the 
Group’s adjusted earnings per share rise by 5.9% to 17.9 
pence per share. In 2017 the Group generated operating 
cashflow of 106% of Adjusted PBITA (2016: 133%).
Net debt
Growth in profits and robust cash flow generation, 
together with net disposal proceeds of £156 million, 
helped reduce the Group’s net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA to 2.4x (2016: 2.8x) in line with our plans.
Market Environment
The global demand outlook for security services remains 
positive as we outline in more detail on pages 8 and 9. 
We expect this positive demand to continue around the 
world in 2018 with the possible exception of the Middle 
East where the effect of prevailing fiscal and macro-
economic conditions remains uncertain.
In the UK & Ireland region, the Brexit negotiations have 
created some uncertainty around UK GDP growth, but, 
in this market, we believe G4S is a defensive business, 
with a number of long-term contracts. We continue to 
invest in innovative products and services for customers 
to drive growth in the region.
Outlook
The outlook for the Group is positive. G4S’ strong 
market positions, growing technology-enabled revenues, 
positive cash generation, commercial discipline and 
on-going productivity programmes provide substantial 
confidence that the Group is very well positioned to 
deliver a strong performance over the next three years. 
To realise this potential G4S is investing in:
• Sales, technology and new products, services  
and solutions to support our aim of growing 
revenues from core businesses by an average of 
4-6% per annum
• Restructuring and efficiency programmes to deliver 
recurring operating gains of £70 million to 
£80 million by 2020, through efficient organisation 
design and leaner processes. Additional refinancing 
gains of around £20 million are also anticipated by 
2020. A portion of these gains will be re-invested in 
growth, with the majority expected to benefit the 
bottom line
We intend to remain soundly financed with average 
operating cash flow conversion of more than 100% of 
Adjusted PBITA and a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
ratio of less than 2.5x. Priorities for excess cash will be 
investment, dividends and, in the near term, further 
leverage reduction.
Following the achievement of the Group’s leverage-
reduction target, the directors propose a 5% increase in 
the final dividend to 6.11p (DKK 0.5097) reflecting the 
board’s confidence in the Group’s performance and 
prospects. Our policy is to increase the dividend in line 
with the long-term growth in earnings.
Our customers and our colleagues are at the core of  
G4S and, in closing, I would like to thank our customers 
for placing their trust in G4S and to pay tribute to our 
570,000 colleagues who serve our customers every day.

Strategic report
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 7 The world continues to face a series 
of divergent and emerging threats. 
Governments and companies require 
holistic approaches to ensure the 
security of their people and assets 
both at home and abroad.
Third-party commentators such as Freedonia expect 
the global security industry to grow 5-6% per annum 
from 2015 to 2025 (see chart on page 9). With our 
global footprint and attractive array of products and 
services we are well positioned to meet this increased 
demand.
Demand for security is increasing 
across the globe
The evolving nature of terrorism, 
which continues to threaten 
societies, has elevated security  
risks and concerns in many parts  
of the world.
Intense price‑based competition 
in basic manned security and basic 
equipment installations
Barriers to entry in basic manned 
security and basic equipment 
installations are low, which can 
result in intense competition in 
some markets.
Companies like G4S are therefore 
looking for ways to increase 
differentiation such as global breadth 
or technology and productivity 
improvement to offset price 
pressure.
Customers buying processes 
increasingly complex
The increasing use of technology, 
globalisation and the growing threat 
of cyber security breaches mean that 
the procurement of security services 
has moved away from operations to 
a more strategic role in an increasing 
number of customers’ organisations. 
The global market for security 
systems integration is estimated  
to be $80bn by 2021
a
.
Technology reshaping security 
industry
Whilst labour costs have increased 
or are increasing, particularly in 
developed markets, the cost of 
sophisticated security technology  
is reducing. Combined with the 
additional data and assurance that 
comes with technology, it is starting 
to reshape the security industry.
MARKET-GROWTH 
DRIVERS
Market‑growth drivers
MEETING THE DEMAND
Global cash‑usage trends
According to third party research 
firm RBR London, cash withdrawn 
from automated teller machines 
(ATMs) between 2016 and 2021 is 
expected to grow by more than 6% 
per annum in emerging markets and 
between 0 to 1% per annum in 
developed markets.
Network consolidation
With lower cash volumes in some 
markets together with new higher 
value added services partly 
cannibalising traditional cash-in-
transit services, it is likely that some, 
if not all cash markets will 
experience network consolidation. 
A number of industry participants 
have publicly stated that they are 
looking to make acquisitions, and we 
have sold some cash businesses to 
focus on our key markets with 
stronger growth potential. We 
believe this market consolidation will 
help network efficiency and lower 
the cost of cash handling.
Retail opportunities
In many markets, retailers operate in 
very competitive environments and 
are looking to reduce costs including 
cash handling and to free up idle 
cash sitting in tills, safes, vehicles and 
cash-processing centres.
G4S software and service enhanced 
smart safes and cash recycling 
services can reduce shrinkage costs 
for retailers, and eliminate or reduce 
the space required for a cash back 
office and cash reconciliation teams.
Through recycling the majority of 
cash takings in store, the number  
of cash-in-transit journeys can be 
reduced by 40% to 60% – with  
both cost-saving and environmental 
benefits.
As more cash is recycled in store, 
less cash is being processed by the 
banks so the retailers achieve a 
reduction in banking fees.

Supplier consolidation 
In certain markets (both Manned 
Services and Systems) we have seen 
some market consolidation and 
trends whereby large competitors 
aim to provide multi-service 
bundled and integrated solutions. 
Some competitors have followed 
this trend to differentiate away from 
the commoditised manned security 
market. We believe this may be 
helping customers move to more 
technology-focused solutions. 
Technology-enabled solutions is  
a less commoditised market than 
traditional manned security  
markets with a lower number  
of capable suppliers. 
HOW G4S RESPONDS
Our new products are being 
adopted by banks and some of the 
world’s leading retailers and we 
expect this market will continue to 
grow strongly. Industry research 
data indicates that our addressable 
market for smart safes and recycling 
solutions is around £20bn-25bn  
per annum
b
.
Automated processes inside bank 
branches
Banks and financial institutions are 
also under pressure to be more 
efficient, lower the cost of handling 
cash, reduce their branch network 
whilst maintaining customer access 
and service. 
We have been developing 
integrated technology to address  
these areas. They combine 
hardware, proprietary cash-
management software, real-time 
banking integration, same day credit 
and customer service and support.
• We assist customers in evaluating 
and understanding security 
trends and their risks through 
experience in the market and the 
provision of software tools such 
as Risk360 and TravelAware. Key 
trends are featured in G4S Risk 
Consulting publications.
• G4S has been investing in 
productivity programmes to  
be more efficient and cost 
competitive (see page 29).
• G4S designs, builds, operates and 
maintains integrated security 
solutions. We invest in 
technology and innovation which 
is changing our sales mix, helping 
deliver service excellence to 
customers (see pages 24 to 28).
• We provide cash solutions and 
services that materially improve 
the control and efficiency of our 
customers’ cash handling. We 
continue to invest in innovative 
products and services such as 
CASH360, Deposita and 
bank-branch automation.
• With the significant progress 
made in some areas of the 
business, we have an enormous 
opportunity to extend and grow 
our new technology and services 
right across our global markets.
• At the end of December 2017 
we had over 19,500 (2016: 
14,600) cash technology 
installations deployed in North 
America, Europe, Asia Pacific  
and Africa.
• We have also made great 
progress in improving 
productivity in a number  
of markets and we now have  
the opportunity to apply these 
improvements across all of  
our cash businesses.
