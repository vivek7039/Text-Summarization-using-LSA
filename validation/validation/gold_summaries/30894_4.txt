COMMUNISIS AT A GLANCE
VALUE FOR CLIENTS
Across the markets in which we operate, common 
themes which enable clients to maximise the benefits 
of the products, services and insight we provide have 
enabled us to define our strategic priorities and the 
optimal divisional structure to deliver them.
Our clients need innovation in their supply chain, 
enabling them to future proof, focus on their core 
activities and grow return on investment and market 
share. They need simplicity in their supply chain, 
reducing the number of key suppliers to a smaller 
number of proactive, strategic partners. Resilience of 
service and regulatory compliance are critical.
Understanding these needs, Communisis delivers 
security, accuracy, integrity and reliability with the cost 
competitive scale of our pan-European network and UK 
operations. We provide multi-channel delivery and digital 
leadership to our clients as well as our unique expertise.
This allows our clients to increase sales at a premium 
and improve speed to market, being lean, standardised 
and simplified. We help them stay safe, manage risk, 
keeping them informed and able to make better 
decisions. This all builds loyalty and trust.

CASE STUDY
HOW THIS WORKED FOR A 
GLOBAL FMCG BRAND
Before Communisis, a client had a minimum 
of 23 touchpoints necessary to successfully 
deliver a project. By driving standardisation, 
providing consistency, control and visibility 
whilst maximising savings opportunities, we 
were able to reduce these touchpoints to 
seven whilst also enabling the client to realise 
the following further benefits:
• increased speed to markets for campaigns;
• encouraging innovation and 
value-added benefits;
• reduced cost to serve through a more 
consolidated delivery of the services;
• access to innovation and capability from 
the supply chain; and 
• greater savings as a result of larger 
spend leverage.
7 TOUCHPOINTS
DEMAND MANAGEMENT
For a marketing execution project, Communisis 
manages the agency interface and prototyping to 
ensure the product is fit for purpose, as well as reviewing 
historic volumes and providing innovative solutions
SOURCING

approved suppliers, ensuring quality assurance, performance and

GETTING MARKET 
POSITIONING RIGHT 
Our team’s new brand for this client 
helped the company to find a unique 
identity in the crowded UK high street 
restaurant scene. By building on the 
existing brand with contemporary, 
striking communications and a 
streamlined, focused menu, we were 
able to strengthen market position 
and increase footfall “beyond 
expectation” in the flagship restaurant.

MULTI-BRAND EFFICIENCY 
For an international FMCG brand, finding 
efficiency and simplicity within their print 
production is not only helpful, but essential. 
By aligning a toolkit of the core commercial 
print across all brand and distribution 
channels, we were able to deliver a 
consistently qualitative commercial solution 
that shortened lead times and increased 
savings during the production of over 
20 million items.

UNDERSTANDING CONSUMER 
BEHAVIOUR 
Ensuring customers continue to buy from the 
same brand again and again remains a critical 
component of success for any consumer-
focused business. For this client, we developed a 
loyalty magazine that contained personalised 
coupons to encourage new purchases. This 
incentivised customers to stay loyal to the 
brand, while also giving the company a highly 
useful buying habit measuring tool.
