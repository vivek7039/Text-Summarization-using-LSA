Strong, profitable growth
Ian Manocha
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to report another year of strong, profitable growth for the 
Group, driven by the continued success of the Clareti business.
In 2017 , Clareti revenue growth was underpinned by high quality new 
customer wins in UK, Western Europe, the United States and Canada. 
It is pleasing to see wins in all our target geographic markets, particularly 
in North America and in continental Europe, following recent investments 
into local sales offices. New customer wins were represented across 
our targeted industry segments including asset managers, hedge funds, 
sell side banks and brokerages, insurance broking, and our second 
win into the energy and commodities sector. A total of 15 new clients 
were won and, with growth from existing accounts during the year, 
high levels of customer retention, and the addition of annuities acquired 
with C24, we exited the year with a strong base of recurring revenues.
With the addition of related consulting and managed services, the 
Clareti business now accounts for more than half of all Group revenues 
and our dependency on legacy revenues continues to reduce.
Our Australian business saw a strong year of revenue growth with 
a deepening relationship with one of the region’s leading banks.  
Our legacy business remained stable during the year with some 
changes in the mix as we proactively manage the portfolio to  
optimise returns.
During the year, we also strengthened our organisation with the 
addition of many excellent new hires. We have appointed regional 
sales leaders in both North America and in Europe, and have hired 
additional staff in direct sales, partner sales and pre-sales. We have 
brought our first full-time HR leader into the business, and we have 
scaled up resources in key technical disciplines such as software 
development, project management and consulting. The continued 
investment in sales and marketing, product and delivery resources, 
has been achieved whilst maintaining margins and improving earnings.
Financial year 2017 reflects yet another strong performance from a 
motivated global team and a further year of excellent progress for the 
Group, which is transforming into one of the UK’s most exciting listed 
financial technology companies. Gresham Technologies plc

Outlook
We started 2018 with the Clareti annuity stream up 24% year-on-year 
and, in the first quarter of 2018 so far, we have signed a further insurance 
broking business for CTC, a Clareti Adapter sale and several professional 
services engagements for delivery of software contracts won in late 2017 .
We will continue to focus our direct sales effort in the UK, Europe and 
North America and we are building partner relationships with major 
system integrators and consulting houses. In Asia Pacific, we will 
continue to expand our work directly with key accounts in Australia 
and Singapore, and we will look to resellers to provide a channel into 
other local markets.
CTC is expected to drive the majority of new wins, with Clareti-as-a-Service 
providing incremental hosting and managed service revenues. 
Clareti Analytics and Clareti Adapters are expected to provide upsell 
opportunity and we also expect to see revenue growing within the 
installed base. We will look for opportunity to broaden the appeal 
of our Clareti ARM offering with new capabilities.
The Group’s legacy portfolio of licences and sub-contracting is 
expected to decline in 2018, although we remain confident that 
our legacy business will be sustained for the medium term.
With Clareti sales now generating more than half of all Group sales 
and with the Group now generating surplus cash for the first time in 
many years, we are confident our strategy is on track and certain 
about our ability to deliver sustainable long-term profitable growth 
for our shareholders.
Thank you for your ongoing support.

Strategy and opportunity
Our goal is to be recognised as a leading global provider of enterprise 
financial technology and deliver sustained profitable growth for the 
Group and long-term value for shareholders.
From a starting point as a newcomer and disruptive challenger in the 
matching and reconciliation space just a few years ago, Gresham is now 
regarded as the emerging champion and we are routinely included in 
vendor selections for new requirements as well as replacements. The core 
use case for Clareti Transaction Control continues to be that of addressing 
larger scale reconciliation and transaction data quality problems in 
financial markets and we intend to capitalise on this opportunity over 
the next few years.
We also see a broader market opportunity for our modern technology 
and we aim to establish Clareti within the financial industry as a “de-facto” 
standard platform for firms with complex data processing challenges 
who need to improve integrity and evidence control across their entire 
business. Regulatory drivers are increasingly behind this requirement 
and it was pleasing to see three RegTech deals signed in 2017 .
In addition to our work in capital markets, the Clareti platform has 
found use cases in corporate banking and payments, securing white 
label and OEM agreements for CTC, Clareti ARM and Clareti 24. The 
transformation underway in transaction banking and industry initiatives 
such as open banking and faster payments is creating opportunities for 
more agile technologies and more innovative FinTech partnerships.
Finally, in the commercial real estate market, we see a longer-term 
opportunity to build on the Clareti Loan Control joint venture 
established at the end of 2016 now that the core product development 
work is substantially complete.
With a core business in next-generation reconciliation technology, a 
closely aligned business in regulatory solutions and complementary 
revenue streams in corporate banking and commercial lending 
solutions, the Group now has four engines to drive future growth. 
Thinking about the business in this way also provides a framework in 
which to consider future acquisitions and to optimise our use of 
capital. Ultimately, it is our intention to build a high-margin, recurring 
revenue business of substantial scale based on licence subscriptions 
and cloud services stemming from our investment into the Clareti 
platform and our deep knowledge of financial markets.
