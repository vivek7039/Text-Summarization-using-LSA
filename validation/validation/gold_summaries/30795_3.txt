Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 Results
The Group’s underlying profit for the year 
increased by 3.5% to £140.5m (2016: 
£135.8m), on revenue which improved by 
11% to £1.6bn (2016: £1.45bn). The Group’s 
statutory profit before tax increased by 13% 
to £112.4m (2016: £99.8m).
Overview
Savills delivered a further strong performance 
in 2017 . In addition to substantial commercial 
transaction volumes in both the UK and a 
number of Asian and European markets, 
the relative resilience of Savills UK 
Residential transaction business, which 
achieved year-on-year revenue growth in 
challenging markets, was of particular note. 
This again demonstrated the importance of 
Savills strengths in prime markets of many 
of the world’s key cities where we increased 
market share. Currency movements also 
had a positive effect on the Group 
contributing approximately £3.9m in 
underlying profit and £2.8m in statutory 
profit before tax on translation.
Our Transaction Advisory revenue grew by 
13%, our Consultancy business revenue by 
14% and our Property Management revenue 
by 9%, including the full year effect of the 
2016 UK acquisition of GBR Phoenix Beard. 
Against the uncertain backdrop of world 
markets, Savills Commercial Transaction 
business grew revenue by 15% with strong 
performances in many markets including the 
UK and significant growth in the Asia Pacific 
region, in particular, Hong Kong, China, 
Japan and Australia. Our Residential 
businesses withstood challenging conditions 
achieving revenue growth of over 6%. Finally, 
Savills Investment Management Assets under 
Management (‘AUM’) increased to £14.6bn 
(2016: £13.9bn). Investment Management 
revenue declined as anticipated, reflecting the 
reduced level of disposal transactions from 
the liquidating SEB German Open Ended 
Funds we inherited as part of the acquisition 
of SEB Asset Management in 2015.
The reduction in transaction fees in the 
Investment Management business, together 
with a decline in the volume of larger 
complex transactions in the US and the 
costs of expansion in a number of markets 
restricted the underlying profit margin to 
8.8% (2016: 9.4%). The statutory pre-tax 
profit margin remained stable at 7.0% (2016: 
6.9%), with lower acquisition-related costs 
and profits on disposal of investments 
offsetting the aforementioned expansion 
costs and decline in the US business.

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 Business development
Savills strategy is to be a leading advisor in 
the key markets in which we operate. Our 
global strategy is delivered locally by our 
experts on the ground with flexibility to 
adapt quickly to changes in circumstances 
and opportunities. They are supported by 
our regional and cross-border investment 
and occupier services specialists. Over the 
last few years we have acquired a number 
of complementary businesses and added 
teams and individual hires to our strong 
core business. 
During 2017, we continued to build our US 
presence with the acquisition of Cresa 
Orange County, a tenant representation 
business in California and the hire of a 
significant new capital markets team in New 
York. In Asia Pacific, we made some 
significant hires in investment sales teams in 
Beijing and Shanghai. In Continental Europe, 
the acquisitions of Aguirre Newman in Spain, 
Larry Smith in Italy and SB management in 
the Czech Republic and the recruitment of 
Industrial teams in Amsterdam and Warsaw 
further strengthened our presence across 
the continent. In the UK, we completed a 
number of team hires across our business 
lines together with the acquisitions of a 
residential lettings business (Granville 
Residential Ltd – Marlow) and a 
commercially focused business in Guernsey 
(Montagu Evans Channel Islands Ltd).
Emerging technology continues to be a focal 
area in the real estate industry and also for 
our business. We have continued to invest in 
our own technology platform in order both to 
deliver innovative solutions to our clients 
through data analysis and insight and to 
drive internal efficiencies. One example is  
the formation of Workthere.com, Savills 
innovative response to the changing 
requirements of occupiers seeking serviced 
office/co-working space in global cities.
In addition, we have reviewed a significant 
number of investment opportunities in the 
field of emerging technology and our 
proprietary investment arm, Grosvenor Hill 
Ventures (“GHV”), has made a number of 
investments in promising technology 
opportunities. GHV comprises a small 
technology team led by the Group CFO  
with a remit to support external technology-
based businesses with the capability of 
significantly enhancing or disrupting 
traditional business models in real estate 
services. Our largest investment to date is  
in YOPA, the digital hybrid residential UK 
estate agent. During the last 12 months it 
has grown to become the 10th largest agent  
in the UK. We have also invested in 
Proportunity, an Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) 
based start-up focused on real estate 
valuation. Finally, in December we invested  
in VuCity, the first digital “smart Cities” 
platform which is focused on making 
planning applications faster and easier for 
sponsors and Local Authorities to progress.
Board
The Board of Savills announced in January 
that Jeremy Helsby will retire as Group Chief 
Executive at the end of 2018 after a 39 year 
career at Savills, 1 1 of them as Group Chief 
Executive. Jeremy will be succeeded by Mark 
Ridley, currently CEO of Savills UK and Europe, 
with effect from 1 January 2019. Mark will join 
the Board of Savills plc as Deputy Group Chief 
Executive on 1 May 2018.
Dividends
An initial interim dividend of 4.65p per share 
(2016: 4.4p) amounting to £6.3m was paid 
on 4 October 2017, and a final ordinary 
dividend of 10.45p (2016: 10.1p) is 
recommended, making the ordinary 
dividend 15.1p for the year (2016: 14.5p). In 
addition, a supplemental interim dividend of 
15.1p (2016: 14.5p) was declared, based 
upon the underlying performance of our 
Transaction Advisory business. Taken 
together, the ordinary and supplemental 
dividends comprise an aggregate 
distribution for the year of 30.2p per share, 
representing an increase of 4% on the 2016 
aggregate dividend of 29.0p. The final 
ordinary dividend of 10.45p per ordinary 
share will, subject to shareholders’ approval 
at the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 
2018, be paid alongside the supplemental 
interim dividend of 15.1p per share on 
14 May 2018 to shareholders on the

I would like to express my thanks to all  
our staff worldwide for their hard work, 
commitment and continued focus on client 
service, enabling the Group to deliver this 
record performance in 2017. 
Outlook
We have made a solid start to 2018 with a 
pipeline of business carried over from last 
year in many markets, although this is 
against the backdrop of heightened market 
uncertainty, geopolitical risks and rising 
interest rates. We anticipate some tempering 
of the strong transaction volumes of recent 
times in some markets. However, at this 
early stage in the year our expectations for 
2018 currently remain unchanged.

Case Study
Stratford, London
Savills acted on behalf of Blackstone and Catalyst Capital on the disposal of 
The Stratford Centre in London. Prior to sale, the investment team provided 
long-term, strategic advice to the vendor. At the point of the sale the 206,000 
sq ft (28,428 sq m) asset was fully let to retailers including Sainsbury’s, Lidl, 
New Look and Boots and benefitted from planning consent for 587 residential 
units. Savills was able to seamlessly combine residential and retail market 
capabilities to fully promote the asset management and development 
potential of the scheme. The highly targeted marketing campaign resulted in  
a sale for £141.5m, a significant premium to the asking terms and reflecting  
a sub 5% NIY.
