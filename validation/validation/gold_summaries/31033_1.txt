Chief Executive’s Review
Review of 2017
Overview
Rolls-Royce made good progress in 2017, 
achieving a number of important operational 
and technological milestones. Results were 
ahead of our expectations as we delivered 
growth in underlying revenue, underlying 
operating profit and free cash flow. This was 
achieved while focusing on managing the 
well-publicised in-service fleet issues on 
the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 engines that 
led to increased costs as efforts were made 
to minimise the disruptive impact on our 
customers and to develop longer-term 
solutions. There was better understanding 
across the business of the need for cultural 
change and tangible progress in our efforts 
to increase openness and transparency with 
investors. We strengthened the executive 
leadership team (ELT) as we continued to 
drive cultural change across the Group.  
We completed our strategic update and  
are ready to move forward in our drive  
for pace and simplicity, restructuring from 
five to three businesses, with a review  
of strategic options for our commercial  
marine operation. 
Civil Aerospace had some notable successes 
in 2017 with record levels of large engine 
deliveries, further expanding the installed 
fleet and generating service revenue 
growth. We made good progress with our 
new large engine programmes, achieving 
the first flight of three new engine designs 
within a 12-month period. Power Systems 
delivered a strong performance  
in its first year with new leadership, 
streamlining the product portfolio and 
Rolls-Royce made good progress in 2017, achieving  
a number of important operational and technological 
milestones, while focusing on managing significant 
in-service engine issues in Civil Aerospace. Looking 
forward, sustaining this improvement and delivering 
increasing cash flow generation will strengthen our 
position as one of the world’s leading industrial 
technology companies.

making new inroads into the Chinese market. 
Defence Aerospace had another solid  
year as we renewed a number of core US 
contracts and further developed our service 
delivery capability. We delivered operational 
improvements in Nuclear, while in Marine we 
established leadership in ship intelligence 
and autonomous shipping. We also received 
regulatory approval for the acquisition of ITP 
Aero which was completed on 19 December 
2017 – see page 9. 
The Group faced several challenges in the 
year. These are not unusual given the nature 
of the industries in which we operate. In Civil 
Aerospace, production milestones were 
achieved against a backdrop of capacity 
constraints, primarily blade manufacturing 
and test bed availability, driven by the 
in-service fleet issues on the Trent 1000  
and Trent 900. As these emerged during  
the year, we increased our estimates of 
additional maintenance activity required  
to mitigate problems, to develop longer-term 
solutions and to support customers through 
a proactive engine management programme 
to minimise any disruption. In Marine, with 
the average Brent crude oil price remaining 
below US$55 per barrel for the third 
consecutive year, our commercial marine 
operation continued to see substantially 
reduced activity levels in its historically 
important offshore market. 
Efficiencies from the 2015 transformation 
programme have achieved run-rate cost 
savings at the top end of our initial 
expectations of £200m by the end of 2017. 
However, costs and complexity within  
the Group remain too high. The further 
simplification announced in January 2018  
to move from five to three operating 
businesses will enable us to act with greater 
pace, to innovate in core technologies  
and to better take advantage of future 
opportunities in areas such as electrification 
and digitalisation. It will help us to undertake 
a more fundamental restructuring to 
remove duplicated support and 
management functions. 
Within the Group, we appreciate our talk  
of simplification must translate into greater 
enablement for our people if we are to 
succeed in bringing about lasting change. 
These efforts must begin with our leaders 
and during the year I brought in additional 
talent and experience to the ELT with the 
appointment of Stephen Daintith as Chief 
Financial Officer, Paul Stein as Chief 
Technology Officer and Simon Kirby as  
Chief Operating Officer. In early 2018, we 
announced Chris Cholerton would be taking 
up the post of President – Civil Aerospace, 
Tom Bell would be returning to Rolls-Royce 
as President – Defence and Harry Holt took 
up the post of Group HR Director.
2017 priorities
At the beginning of the year we set out  
four key priorities:
Priority 1: Strengthen our focus  
on engineering, operational and 
aftermarket excellence 
Engineering excellence – our central 
engineering function was restructured to 
integrate engineering into the businesses 
closer to our customers. At the same time, 
we have created a new technology team  
led by the Chief Technology Officer to 
heighten the importance of technology  
in driving future growth – see pages  
42 and 43. We invested over £1bn in  
self-funded R&D in 2017, part of which 
supported the installation of digital 
engineering tools, producing our first 
all-digital engine design. 
Operational excellence – a new operating 
strategy was developed and we invested  
a further £764m in capital expenditure  
in 2017. Capitalising on the rapidly 
advancing digital techniques, our aim is  
to create an agile, highly productive and  
cost-competitive manufacturing footprint.  
Our new plants have already undergone  
a digital transformation generating an 
unprecedented insight into our value  
chain capability. We are also developing  
industry-leading capabilities in digital 
manufacturing, through innovative 
collaboration and partnerships, which will 
lead to double-digit benefits in productivity 
and efficiency. All our businesses had 
significant execution targets and product 
delivery milestones to achieve. Civil 
Aerospace delivered a 35% increase in  
large engine deliveries. In Defence 
Aerospace, the modernisation programme  
at the Indianapolis facility progressed well 
and is on track with its cost saving targets.  
In Power Systems, the new leadership 
focused the business on simplifying the 
product portfolio, achieving around a 20% 
year-on-year reduction in product variants. 
Aftermarket excellence – service focus is 
driven by customer demand for reliability 
and availability. This has seen aftermarket 
support transition from the sale of spare 
products to a partnership with customers 
based on predictive maintenance and 
proactive management of in-service issues. 
In 2017, the Civil Aerospace team worked 
hard to minimise customer disruption from 
in-service fleet issues with our Trent 1000 
and Trent 900 engines and to develop 
longer-term solutions. Concurrently, the 
Trent XWB-84 achieved over 1.2 million 
flying hours with unprecedented levels  
of reliability. In Defence Aerospace, we 
opened a further two dedicated service 
delivery centres (SDCs) to support the  
RAF and the Indian Air Force, accelerating 
decision-making on engine issues to 
maximise availability. Power Systems also 
opened customer care centres in key time 
zones, replicating the TotalCare service 
developed in Civil and Defence Aerospace. 
Power Systems’ first availability contract 
commenced in 2017 with Hitachi Rail to run 
In Civil Aerospace, while we worked to 
minimise the impact of in-service issues,  
key milestones were achieved towards  
entry into service for the new  
Trent 1000 TEN, Trent XWB-97 and  
Trent 7000. Testing of our new power 
gearbox design, a vital component in our 
new UltraFan demonstrator programme,  
has proceeded well and the Advance3 
demonstrator achieved its first successful 
ground test. Electrification will play an 
increasingly important role in all areas of  
the Group over the coming years and during 
the year we established a new electrical unit.  
In November 2017, we announced that  
we will develop the E-Fan X hybrid electric 
aircraft demonstrator in collaboration  
with Airbus and Siemens; reflecting the 
growing importance of electrification  
to the long-term future of the  
aerospace industry.

for over 20 years, covering support for the 
UK’s intercity programme. Looking forward, 
a focus on lifecycle costs coupled with the 
delivery of more digitally enabled engines 
and systems should support further growth 
in proactive service management offerings 
at Power Systems. 
Priority 2: Sustain the strong start 
to our transformation programme 
On-target delivery of transformation 
benefits – since November 2015, we have 
been pursuing a transformation programme 
focused on simplifying the organisation, 
streamlining management, reducing  
fixed costs and adding greater pace  
and accountability to decision-making.  
The benefits are on-target, having achieved 
run-rate cost savings at the top end of  
our initial expectations of £200m by the 
end of 2017. 
Priority 3: Rebuild trust and 
confidence in our long-term 
growth prospects 
Greater financial transparency through 
further clarity on cash drivers and  
revenue – as outlined at our half-year 2017 
results, our focus is on sustaining stronger 
cash generation. A stronger finance team, 
led by Stephen Daintith, is bringing greater 
financial transparency and clarity both 
internally and for our investors. In 2018,  
we plan to introduce new KPIs to align  
with our refined long-term performance 
objectives and reflect our focus on free 
cash flow as a fundamental indicator of 
performance. See page 17 for more details. 
On adopting the new revenue reporting 
standard IFRS 15, introduced from 1 January 
2018, we have selected accounting policies 
that provide clarity and transparency of  
our revenue and profit – see page 55.  
On page 170 we have taken the opportunity 
to proactively present our 2017 financial 
results as they would look under the new 
reporting standard. 
Priority 4: Develop our  
long-term vision and strategy
Refreshed vision and strategy for  
Rolls-Royce – we completed our strategic 
update in the year and in early January 
2018 we announced a simplification from 
five to three businesses and a review  
of strategic options for our commercial 
marine operation. This simplification  
aligns our business more closely with our 
customers and with our strategic vision  
to pioneer cutting-edge technologies  
that deliver the cleanest, safest and most 
competitive solutions to meet our planet’s 
vital power needs. 
Our ambition is to be the world’s leading 
industrial technology company. We will 
continue to innovate in our core areas  
while looking to champion electrification  
to support the move to a low carbon global 
economy. Our digital tools and technologies 
will allow us to create new insights and 
opportunities across our businesses.  
The simplification of the Group enables  
us to focus our capital allocation  
on projects that support our strategy. 
Further details on our vision and strategy 
can be found on page 11.

STRATEGIC REPORT
2018 priorities and outlook 
Our people worked hard in 2017 but more 
remains to be done. Our goal is to make 
2018 a breakthrough year in terms of 
strategic, operational and financial goals. 
The simplification of our operating 
businesses into three focused units will 
enable the Group to operate at greater 
pace. We must also address the cost  
and complexity of the Group in order to 
improve the service we offer customers  
and our financial returns. I am confident 
that with the right management team now 
in place, a simplified business structure  
and steps being taken to improve our 
processes, we will make further meaningful 
progress in meeting our strategic, 
operational and financial goals in 2018.  
Our largest business, Civil Aerospace,  
will continue to focus on increasing engine 
deliveries and working with customers  
to minimise the impact of in-service engine 
issues. Across the Group there will be new 
product introductions and continued R&D 
investment and capital expenditure to 
revitalise current products and innovate 
new technologies. We will also look to 
report progress on the strategic review  
of our commercial marine operation.  
This fundamental restructuring, combined 
with improving cash flow, will strengthen 
our balance sheet and we will communicate 
the KPIs that underpin a more disciplined 
approach to capital allocation. While Group 
underlying revenue and profit before 
financing will be impacted by the adoption 
of IFRS 15, free cash flow is unaffected  
by accounting changes and is expected  
to increase significantly from 2017 levels. 
Longer-term outlook 
Our longer-term outlook remains strong 
and we believe in the transformative 
potential of our technology. The 
progressive roll-out of our original 
equipment into markets with long-term 
underlying growth will increase our 
installed base over the next ten years.  
This, in turn, will drive significant free cash 
flow as we increase penetration of our 
service products. The fundamental 
restructuring announced in January 2018 
shows our willingness to take decisive 
action now in order to secure and enhance 
the long-term benefit of the cash flows that 
will be generated over the years to come. 
We must become a more agile and 
adaptable organisation. 
Our aim is for our people to have a shared 
vision while being empowered to act 
responsively. This will support us as we  
look to develop innovative power expertise, 
new digital solutions and advances in 
electrification that will enable Rolls-Royce 
technology to lead the world into a low 
carbon future. 
ITP AERO BECOMES A ROLLS-ROYCE COMPANY 
In late 2017, Rolls-Royce received approval from the Spanish 
Government for the acquisition of the 53.1% stake in ITP Aero 
owned by our partner in the business, SENER. Having taken 
full ownership of the company, ITP Aero is now a separate 
business unit within Rolls-Royce. ITP Aero will retain 
organisational autonomy allowing it to continue serving 
other original equipment manufacturers (OEM) as customers, 
while meeting our governance and compliance standards. 
Based in Bilbao, Spain, ITP Aero is an aero-engine component 
designer and manufacturer that offers products and services 
across the widebody, single-aisle, regional, corporate and 
defence aviation markets. It has worked with Rolls-Royce  
as a risk and revenue sharing partner on all members of  
the Trent engine family, manufacturing low pressure  
turbines, and is an important partner on the UltraFan engine 
development programme. ITP Aero also provides essential 
aerospace products and services to a number of important 
customers outside of Rolls-Royce. ITP Aero is a partner in the 
main European Defence aviation consortia and is the Spanish 
Defence aeronautical engine reference company, supporting 
existing and future programmes as well as providing in-service 
support to the Spanish fleet.
