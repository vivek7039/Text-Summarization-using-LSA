 Chief Executive's Statement
Unusually for a CEO statement, I am not 
going to talk about what a great job the 
managers have done for the shareholders, 
nor about the company’s performance over 
the last twelve months, or indeed, prospects 
for the next twelve.
Instead, at a time when the public support 
for the free market economy is fraying and 
many more people see the world of business 
as a zero sum game, where profit can only 
be earned at the expense of, rather than 
in the service of, customers, I’d like to talk 
about the value that Admiral has delivered 
for UK motorists over the last 20 years, while 
making, and not despite making, good  
profits throughout.
The first reason Admiral has been, and 
remains, good news for customers is that 
we operate at a lower cost than almost all 
our competitors. When shopping for car 
insurance, most motorists are looking for the 
best possible price, along with reassurance 
that they’ll be looked after well, when 
needed. Admiral’s lower costs mean lower 
premiums for our customers.
Over most of the last 20 years our costs 
have been lower than our competitors – by 
at least ten percentage points of premium. 
That’s the equivalent of £50 less expense 
for a typical policy, and over £200 less for a 
higher premium policy. And that’s one of the 
main reasons Admiral’s brands come top on 
the UK’s price comparison sites more often 
than any of our competitors.
In the nineties, the industry was dominated 
by large, often grossly inefficient, multi-
product, composite insurers with too many 
layers and top heavy structures. Most of 
those are long gone, under the pressure from 
upstarts like Admiral and other, lower-cost, 
Admiral-like, operators who have followed 
in our footsteps. So much the better for the 
customer and an example of the creative 
destruction which explains the success of 
competitive free markets.
“ The first reason Admiral has been, and remains, good news  
for customers is that we operate at a lower cost”
MultiCover; Telematics (200k+ customers, 
and rising); 10-month Bonus Accelerator (one 
from the nineties for real insurance anoraks) 
have all made our policies more attractive 
and more accessible to UK motorists 
and householders, and helped keep our 
acquisition costs low.
I strongly believe that a market made up  
of a large number of companies competing 
actively for customers’ attention and loyalty, 
combined with appropriate regulatory 
oversight, is a recipe for the best possible 
outcome for motorists and householders, 
and I believe that Admiral’s success over  
the last 25 years demonstrates why.

P.S. I don’t want to count chickens, but 
in a year during which our Italian insurer 
broke through 500,000 vehicles on cover, 
delivered a fourth year of profit in a row and 
reduced its expense ratio by an amazing six 
percentage points, I’m looking forward, in a 
few years time, to saving myself an hour or 
two by recycling the above CEO Statement, 
but just substituting “ConTe” for “Admiral”.
Cheap, but maybe “nasty” the cynics  
might reply.
Far from it.
With “an intention to renew after a claim” score 
of consistently well over 90% (94.5% in 2017 
to be precise) we deliver for our customers at 
the moment of truth. And you cannot build 
four million plus customers in the fiercely 
competitive UK insurance market without 
delivering a good customer experience. 
Not every time. 
We make mistakes. 
But we recognise the long-term value of the 
company depends on us making sure our 
customers, by and large, are not only glad 
to join us but also happy to stay with us.
If I’m proud of our outperformance on 
expense compared to the bulk of the car 
insurance market, I’m doubly proud of our 
expense ratio advantage in our relatively new 
and rapidly growing home insurance operation 
– doubly proud because our cost advantage 
over the market is not ten percentage points, 
but nearer twenty points. Again, this allows us 
to be the top most often on price comparison 
sites, while also making a profit. Admittedly, 
as yet, a small one, but watch this space.
How do we achieve lower costs while 
delivering a great product (5 star Defaqto 
ratings available across all Admiral’s Motor 
products) and (normally) a positive customer 
experience, and why don’t most of our 
competitors manage all three?
Well, it’s not just about the constant pursuit 
of efficiencies by a loyal and motivated team 
of employee shareholders (because all of us 
are both). It’s also about another great driver 
of growth in long-term prosperity in free 
market economies – innovation. Throughout 
our life major innovations such as

comparison site; MultiCar and now
