Strategic report
 > Strategy focused on delivering 
shareholder value
 > Long-term cash generation from 
our Hull and East Yorkshire segment
 > Sustainable growth in our 
Enterprise segment
Dear Shareholder
Our objective is to deliver long-term, sustainable value for our 
shareholders. Our strategy is designed to offer shareholders 
a combination of income generation and value accretion. 
Strategic focus
Hull and East Yorkshire is core to the strategic direction 
of KCOM, and receives the majority of the Group’s investment. 
We are fully committed to completing the fibre deployment 
across our market to deliver premium services both to homes 
and businesses. This should deliver long-term sustainable cash 
generation, to continue to support our dividend policy. 
Our Enterprise business is focused on market areas, where we 
have seen good growth and where we have market leading skills. 
We are targeting development in this area to provide momentum 
in shareholder value. A key part of our growth this year comes 
from additional business from existing customers who recognise 
the value we can add to their business. This helps to give us 
confidence that our strategy is the right one. The Board expects, 
over the coming 24 months to see further substantial progress, 
in support of this strategy.
Clear focus 
on the future 
Chairman’s statement

Strategic report
While we continue the investment in our fibre deployment 
and the further development of our Enterprise business, I am 
pleased to confirm that the Board is recommending, subject to 
shareholder approval, a final dividend of 4.00 pence per share, 
in accordance with our existing commitment to deliver a 
minimum full year dividend of 6.00 pence per share for both this 
year and the year ending 31 March 2018. This reflects both our 
confidence in the strategy being executed by the management 
team and longer term prospects.
Board appointment
In October, Jane Aikman joined the Board as Chief Financial 
Officer. Jane previously held a number of Executive level 
positions, including her most recent role as Chief Financial 
Officer and Chief Operating Officer for Phoenix IT Group Plc 
until its acquisition by and merger with Daisy Group.
Jane has quickly established herself as a valued member of the 
Board and her fresh perspectives are already bringing additional 
strength and focus to the business. Jane will stand for election 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in July.
Board effectiveness
We continually consider the effectiveness of the Board and have 
a formal evaluation annually, which in 2016 was carried out by 
our Company Secretary. The conclusion from the evaluation was 
that we are operating effectively but there were some minor 
areas for improvement. We continue to monitor against our set 
of Board objectives which are detailed further in the Corporate 
governance section. In 2017, we will conduct an externally 
facilitated evaluation.
“ We remain in an environment 
of change and transition 
both internally and for our 
customers and markets. 
Each presents new challenges 
and exciting opportunities.”
We seek always to ensure that we have appropriate succession 
plans in place both for the Board and for the senior management 
team of the business as well as recognising talent right across 
the organisation. This has been a regular topic of discussion 
during the year and is covered in the Nomination Committee 
report on page 44. 
Good governance and responsible business 
Good governance is essential to the business and we seek 
to adopt best practice where it is beneficial.
In line with best practice, we have recently completed a 
consultation with major shareholders around some proposed 
changes to our Remuneration policy. I am pleased to say that 
they received widespread support and the policy will be 
presented to shareholders for approval at the AGM.
As a major business headquartered in Hull, we are delighted to 
be a Principal Partner for Hull’s 2017 City of Culture celebration. 
This 12 month programme is designed to bring a wide variety 
of cultural and artistic events to the city and provide a range 
of opportunities for the local community to experience the 
positive impact that this will bring. As well as supporting the 
events themselves, the business is supporting a number of our 
employees who are volunteering as City of Culture ambassadors.
We hope that the legacy left by the City of Culture programme 
will support the continued regeneration of the region for many 
years to come.
We remain in an environment of change and transition both 
internally and for our customers and markets. Each presents 
new challenges and exciting opportunities and we value and 
appreciate the energy and enthusiasm that our colleagues 
across the business show in making life easier and better for 
our customers. 
I would like to thank them all for their continuing contribution. 
This, coupled with the clear focus that we have on the future, 
gives the Board every confidence that we can achieve our 
ambitions as a business.
