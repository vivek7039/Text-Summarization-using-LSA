OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
• Annual silver production up 16.6%  
in line with guidance, driven by the  
first complete year of San Julián  
phase I operating at full capacity  
and the start-up of operations at  
San Julián phase II, now operating  
at nameplate capacity.
• Gold production exceeded guidance 
principally as a result of the full year  
of operations at San Julián phase I, 
although it reduced by 2.6% year-on-
year due to the expected reduction of 
gold inventories at Herradura.
• Gold resources remained stable and 
gold reserves increased 22.7%. Silver 
resources increased 6.9% while silver 
reserves decreased 5.4%.
• One fatality occurred in early 2017.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
• Adjusted revenue 
1
 of US$2,233.2 
million, up 9.2% over 2016 due to 
higher silver and zinc volumes sold 
and increased gold, lead and zinc 
metal prices.
• Gross profit and EBITDA up 4.9%  
and 2.7%, to US$925.4 million and 
US$1,060.1 million respectively.
• Profit from continuing operations

leverage ratio; cash and other liquid

1 Adjusted revenue is the revenue shown in the 
income statement adjusted to add back treatment 
and refining costs and gold, lead and zinc hedging. 
The Company considers this a useful additional 
measure to help understand underlying factors 
driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and 
realised prices.
2 Cash and other liquid funds are disclosed in  
note 31(c) to the Financial Statements.
