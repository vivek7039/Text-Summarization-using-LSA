CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 24 March 2017 
were £76m. 
• We launched CleanPro in 2014. 
This range of professional cleaning 
products has been well received 
by customers. We have 50,000 
customers buying CleanPro each 
week with sales of £44m per annum.
• We continue to improve the ‘good, 
better, best’ of the offer in order to 
satisfy all customers. For example, 
Chefs Essentials chips grew at 31% 
and Chefs Larder chips at 9%. We 
launched Chefs Larder Premium 
Chips, these are gluten free and have 
already achieved sales of £4m.  We 
have won ‘Best Frozen Product’ 
at The Caterer Product Excellence 
Awards and ‘Best Frozen Food’ at the 
Wholesale Q Awards.
• We have also been growing with 
branded suppliers.
Since November 2005 we have been 
seeking to ‘Focus, Drive and Broaden’ 
Booker Group. 2016 was another  good 
year in a challenging market Tobacco 
legislation depressed our retail customer 
sales and there has been signifi cant 
movement in commodity prices. Despite 
these challenges the Group continued 
to make good progress on both the 
catering and retail sides of the business.
FOCUS (commenced 
November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
effi cient operator in our sector. We 
continue to improve business effi ciency. 
We ‘stop, simplify and standardise’ work 
and invest most of the resulting savings 
in customer service. We extended the 
use of ‘self-scan’ and improved stock 
management. Our close attention to 
cash has resulted in having £161m of 
net cash, whilst keeping the Group cost 
base in line with last year (pre Budgens 
and Londis).
DRIVE (commenced March 2006)
Booker Wholesale/Makro, our cash and 
carry businesses had a good year. We 
continue to ‘Drive’ choice, price and 
service for our customers. Each year 
we survey 45,000 customers to identify 
where improvements can be made. 
Customer satisfaction is a key measure 
within the business and we have made 
signifi cant progress since 2006. 
Choice Up
Booker seeks to grow brand and own 
brand sales.
• In October 2016 we launched 
Blackgate signature beef. The quality 
is superb and it is already being 
bought by 7,000 customers with 
annualised sales of £17m.

“Thanks to the hard work of everybody in 
the Group, our plan to Focus, Drive and 
Broaden the business remains on track. 
Booker Group had a good year; customer 
satisfaction was strong, sales and profi ts 
were the best we’ve ever achieved.” Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Booker’s Pricing vs Cash & Carry Market
Prices Down
• We operate in a very price 
competitive market. Every week we 
monitor prices versus competitors 
and during the year our price index 
remained competitive (see graph). 
We are continuing to keep our 
core line prices at market leading 
levels to provide the best possible 
margin for our customers. Booker 
has consistently offered low prices 
on core products and maintains its 
promise of helping the customer 
during challenging times.
Better Service
• Our people are doing a brilliant job. 
Our customers rate Booker people 
highly. Business Centre teams 
across the Group have been trained 
in PRIDE to help improve the Parking, 
Reception, Internal, Delivery and Exit 
experience.
• We have continued to expand and 
improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers 
and greengrocers within the business 
than last year. We also have skilled 
fishmongers operating in our Makro 
Business Centres.
• Booker offers a seven days a 
week multi-temperature delivery 
service to both retail and catering 
customers (70% of the fleet has 
multi temperature capacity). Our 
delivery customers pay the same 
price for goods as our collect 
customers. Our delivery business 
continues to grow (from £600m in 
2008/9 to £2.3bn in 2016/17).
Caterers/Small Business
• We are privileged to serve 441,000 
catering customers and 641,000 
small businesses. Our catering 
customers include restaurants, fast 
food outlets, licenced premises and 
cost centre caterers. These can be 
independent, single site locations, 
Group Accounts and National 
Chains. All customers can draw 
upon the Booker, Makro, Classic 
and Chef Direct infrastructures.  
This has helped strengthen caterer 
satisfaction and grown like-for-
like catering sales by 4.4%. This is 
despite price deflation in the catering 
market. 
• We have also made good progress 
with Group Accounts, such as 
Enterprise Group and Rick Stein, 
where we serve these accounts from 
Booker and Makro. 
• Our Chef Direct business, which 
serves national accounts from our 
distribution centre in Didcot, has 
also had a good year serving clients 
including Byron Burgers, Carluccios, 
Prezzo, Aramark and Wagamama.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Retailers
• We serve 94,000 independent retailers. 
Our largest retail customers tend to 
be our Premier, Londis, Budgens 
and Family Shopper symbol club 
members. We also serve our retail club 
members, unaffiliated independents 
and retail national accounts.
Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew to 3,306 stores (3,213 stores last 
year). The retail development team 
has put a lot of work into building the 
sales and profits of existing Premier 
stores.  Premier was voted the best 
symbol group by consumers at the 
CTP Awards.
• Premier operates a no cost model for 
members, and has the advantage for 
retailers of providing deliveries and 
also the ability to top-up at their local 
Booker branch. We install the fascia 
and imagery free of charge and also 
provide a market leading promotion 
every four weeks. All goods are 
delivered at cash and carry prices.
Family Shopper
• We continue to develop Family 
Shopper, a local discount format. 
This is doing well. At May 2017, we 
have 63 stores and the response to 
this format has been encouraging.
Budgens & Londis
• On 14 September 2015 Budgens 
and Londis joined the Group. 
Budgens serves 156 retailers. The 
Budgens consumer is typically ABC1. 
Londis serves 1,850 retailers with 
approximately 49% of consumers 
being ABC1. Since completion of the 
acquisition, the teams at Budgens 
and Londis have “joined forces” with 
the Group.  They have embraced the 
Booker approach to cash, customer 
satisfaction and health & safety.  In the 
year we have opened a net 381 Londis 
and 6 Budgens outlets.  As a result the 
sales have grown strongly. 
• Budgens and Londis were acquired 
for £40m and, to March 2017, in 
relation to this acquisition we have 
generated net cash of c.£42m.
• Thanks to a lot of hard work by our 
IT and central colleagues, we have 
integrated the Londis/Budgens 
systems into the Booker platforms. 
All the teams have done a fantastic 
job of growing both brands. It is a 
credit to our teams and the wonderful 
retailers we serve via Premier, Londis, 
Budgens, Family Shopper, Shop 
Locally and all our other retailers that 
we have seen strong growth.
Booker Direct
• Booker Direct serves national retail 
chains from our distribution centres 
with customers including Marks & 
Spencer, most of the cinema chains 
in the UK and the prison service in 
England and Wales. Together the 
Group can now serve any independent 
retailer, Group Accounts and National 
Chains throughout the UK.
BROADEN (commenced  
April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the best 
choice, price and service to caterers, 
retailers and small business. We also 
seek to become the suppliers’ preferred 
route to market. In addition, we want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Digital 
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £1,072m, 
up from £979m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
569,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 490,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details and order products. 
There are double the number of stock 
keeping units available to a typical 
customer on the website through our 
special order system. 
 Ritter-Courivaud
• Ritter-Courivaud is a speciality foods 
supplier to the UK’s leading restaurants. 
Ritter had a good year growing sales 
through the Makro business centres 
and direct to customers.
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
first business centre in Mumbai. We 
now have four branches in Mumbai, 
one in Surat and one joint venture 
branch in Pune. These serve 21,000 
customers, and have also launched 
200 Happy Shopper symbol retailers 
which harness the lessons learned 
from Premier in the UK for the Kirana 
stores of Mumbai. We continue 
to review growth options in India 
and look forward to developing the 
Booker offer to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers.
Sustainability
• Carbon Trust Standard held for both 
Carbon and Waste.
• Over 31,000 customers are now 
recycling with the Group through 
our packaging and used cooking oil 
recycling services. This helps our 
customers save money, increase 
recycling levels and support more 
sustainable communities throughout 
the UK.
• LED lighting now installed in 35 
business centres, one distribution 
centre and two distribution centre 
freezer rooms with an average overall 
energy saving of 22%.
• Over 10.5 million litres of used 
cooking oil has been recycled, up 
57% on last year.
• Waste to landfill down 73% versus 
last year.
• We donated surplus food equivalent 
to over 800,000 meals to local 
charities in the last year and have 
donated over two million meals in the 
last five years.
• We are committed to helping our 
retail and catering customers serve 
communities throughout the United 
Kingdom. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
People 
• Again our team have done a brilliant 
job this year. We are committed to 
continuing to make Booker better and 
safer for colleagues. We continue to 
develop talent. To ensure succession 
needs for our Fresh Departments 
are fulfilled with the right people, we 
have developed another cohort of 
Trainees through our successful in 
house Fresh Training Programmes. 
This year, a further 52 Butchers, 12 
Fishmongers and 55 Greengrocers 
graduated and went on to work in 
these key departments, supporting 
our customers. 
• There are currently a further 116 
colleagues participating in this year’s 
schemes who are due to graduate in 
Autumn 2017 and we intend to run all 
three schemes again in 2017/18. 
• To build on the expertise of our 
Butchery teams further, we have been 
working with The Institute of Meat to 
raise and recognise the skill level of 
our Butchery teams. In February 
2017, 8 of our Butchery Managers 
were officially awarded the Institute 
of Meat, Master Butcher Award. This 
puts them amongst an elite group of 
just 29 Butchery Professionals in the 
UK to hold this award currently. This 
is part of a longer term plan to up-
skill and develop our future Butchery 
Managers who are all currently 
working through an in house Craft 
Butcher training programme, which 
has been developed with and is 
endorsed by The Institute of Meat. 
• Investment in our delivery teams 
has continued, with development 
programmes to ensure drivers and 
managers have the knowledge and 
skills to operate safely and efficiently, 
whilst providing a great service for 
our customers:
 – Our drivers and managers have 
inductions and annual refreshers 
covering Safe, Secure and Legal 
training and our vocational 
drivers complete training for the 
Driver Certificate of Professional 
Competence (CPC), which is run 
by our team of in-house trainers 
and delivery support managers. 
 – Following a trial last year, we have 
fully launched a Driver Academy, 
open to internal and external 
colleagues who wish to develop 
their career with Booker; ensuring 
we have the right drivers in place 
to fulfil succession in this growing 
area of the business. We currently 
have over 50 Drivers working 
towards becoming a Van or Large 
Goods Vehicle Driver in our Booker 
and Makro Business Centres. 
• For the twelfth year running, the 
performance of the business means 
our people have shared in our 
success through our bonus system. 
With this great team of people, Booker 
will continue to make progress in the 
year ahead. 
Merger with Tesco
On 27 January we announced the  
planned merger with Tesco to form 
the UK’s leading food business. This 
combination should improve choice, 
quality, prices and service for the UK 
consumer. It should also help the Booker 
catering, retail and small business 
customer prosper in a challenging 
market. We are continuing to assist 
the UK competition authorities in their 
ongoing consideration of the merger 
and it is expected that the merger will 
complete in late 2017 / early 2018, 
subject to, amongst other things, the 
necessary shareholder approvals. 
During this process Booker will ensure 
it is “Business as Usual”. We are 
excited by the opportunities the merger 
creates for consumers, our customers, 
suppliers, colleagues and shareholders.
Overall
Booker Group had another good 
year.  Our plan to Focus, Drive and 
Broaden the business remains on track.  
Customer satisfaction was strong and 
sales and profits were the best we 
have ever achieved.  We are planning 
to merge with Tesco to create the UK’s 
leading food business.  This merger 
should deliver significant benefits 
for consumers, Booker customers, 
suppliers, colleagues and shareholders.  
We are very grateful for the support of 
our customers, suppliers and everybody 
in the Group and look forward to making 
progress in the year ahead.
