 Chairman’s statement
Assura’s purpose is to provide 
GPs and patients with the 
buildings they need today 
for the NHS of tomorrow.
Simon Laffin
Non-Executive Chairman
Dear Shareholder 
Assura has continued 
to grow over the last 
12 months.
 
Our property portfolio expanded 
significantly, through both acquisitions 
and new developments. In the past year 
we have added £170 million of property 
and this, together with the £141 million 
of property additions in the previous 
year, has increased our net rental 
income by 16% to £67.9 million. We 
are now the UK’s largest developer and 
owner-manager of primary healthcare 
property with a property portfolio 
valued at over £1.3 billion.
The increased scale of our operations 
and our strong financial position have 
assisted us in obtaining better terms 
on our debt. We have signed new 
unsecured debt facilities of £350 million, 
lowering the overall cost of borrowings 
by 78 basis points to 4.06%.
Last year we set a lower medium-term 
loan to value (“LTV”) target range of 
between 40% and 50%. At the year 
end our LTV was 37%, well positioned 
relative to this range. We are continuing 
to source attractive investment 
opportunities and we currently have a 
pipeline of further property acquisitions 
and developments of £153 million 
in solicitors’ hands. This will in time 
increase the LTV. We shall continue 
to monitor what the right LTV range 
is for the Company.
A key part of our strategy is our 
unique proposition of offering all of 
the elements of the property service 
for GPs. This provides GPs with a 
long-term partner approach throughout 
the lifecycle of a medical centre, from 
first idea of a new surgery through: 
the NHS business case; development 
and build of the new surgery; moving 
in; disposal of the old property; and 
maintenance of the premises over 
the next 25 plus years. Our ability to 
“develop, invest and manage” gives us 
a crucial advantage when securing new 
development opportunities and other 
asset management initiatives with GPs. 
Moreover, it provides a highly scalable 
model that means that, as we grow, 
the benefits of scale accrue to 
shareholders and drive our progressive 
dividend policy and shareholder returns. 
The benefit of this model has been 
illustrated again this year as rent roll 
rose by 17% to £74.4 million and EPRA 
earnings rose by 58% to £40.3 million.

4  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dividends
We aim to deliver superior risk adjusted 
returns to our shareholders. A key 
component of this return is a growing, 
covered dividend. In January 2017 the 
Board increased our quarterly dividend 
payment by 9% to 0.60 pence per 
share or 2.4 pence per share on an 
annualised basis. This represents an 
increase of over 33% from the level of 0.45 
pence per share paid three years ago.
Shareholder engagement
We are committed to the highest 
standards of financial transparency 
and believe a significant investment 
in investor relations activity is a key 
responsibility for any public company. 
We have held 95 meetings with 
investors during the year and I am 
delighted to welcome a number of 
new shareholders onto our register. 
Our people and the Board
The past year was marked by the tragic 
death of our previous CEO, Graham 
Roberts. Graham stepped down in 
March 2016 and passed away in July, 
having been suffering from cancer. 
Graham was a great leader and CEO 
for Assura over his four years in charge, 
delivering a period of remarkable 
success which saw the Group grow from 
a market capitalisation of £152 million to 
become a FTSE 250 company valued at 
over £900 million. He had a clear vision, 
inspired investor confidence and built a 
strong team, all of which transformed 
Assura into a leading player in the sector.
I became Executive Chairman in March 
last year to cover for Graham’s absence. 
In October 2016, the Board appointed 
Jonathan Murphy as Interim CEO and 
confirmed him as permanent CEO in 
February 2017. Jonathan had been 
Finance Director since January 2013. 
He brings extensive knowledge and 
experience to the role, as well as the 
commitment and ability to continue to 
deliver on our strategy. We are currently 
recruiting for a new Finance Director.
I am delighted to welcome Andrew 
Darke onto the Board as Property 
Director. Andrew has been with Assura 
since its flotation in 2003 and brings to 
the Board an unparalleled knowledge 
and understanding of the specialist 
primary care property market.
We have 43 people employed in 
Assura and, on behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank them all for their 
hard work, dedication and contribution 
to the success of the business through 
such a busy year.
Our investment case
By following our strategies we can deliver long-term 
shareholder value through:
  Low volatility of property returns
  Low default risk
  Linkage to cost inflation
  Scalable, internally managed model
  Covered, progressive dividends
  Excellent risk adjusted returns.
Culture, values and ethics 
The NHS is Assura’s prime customer, 
accounting for 86% of our total rent roll. 
We strongly support the NHS and believe 
in its vital role in the country’s health. We 
aim to provide the NHS, GPs and patients 
with the buildings needed for the NHS 
of today and tomorrow. These buildings 
provide the essential social infrastructure 
required to improve the health of the 
communities in which we operate. We 
direct private sector capital to provide, 
develop and enhance primary care 
premises. Some 6% of the UK’s NHS 
patients now use our premises.
This important social dimension to 
our work is reflected in our alignment 
with the values of the NHS and our 
commitment to the highest standards 
of ethics and integrity. We have robust 
ethical policies and control procedures 
which help us ensure that good 
business ethics are embedded across 
the Group. The Government and NHS 
control both new asset investment and 
rental increases, based on a transparent 
market mechanism. This reflects the 
mutually beneficial partnership that 
we have with the public sector.
For a number of years, we have been 
working on designing and developing 
an energy neutral building, which brings 
together the latest thinking in sustainable 
design practice and construction 
techniques. Our first project under this 
initiative is now nearing completion and 
we hope to apply these innovative 
approaches to future schemes in our 
development pipeline. This is in addition 
to our commitment to meeting the highest 
possible BREEAM accreditation for our 
schemes as evidenced by us achieving 
a “Very Good” accreditation for both 
properties completed in the year.
Looking ahead
With the support of our shareholders, 
Assura has the strongest balance sheet 
in the sector and we are well placed 
to continue investing in what remains a 
very fragmented market. In addition, we 
remain focused on carefully managing 
our existing portfolio with our in-house 
management team continuing to deliver 
the highest standard of customer 
service and operational excellence for 
the nation’s GPs, while also maximising 
the value of our portfolio through asset 
management initiatives.
Although the NHS and primary care 
policy consensus across all mainstream 
parties is now more positive than ever 
before, we remain frustrated by the 
slow progress in transforming policy 
into meaningful investment in primary 
care premises. It looks as if the general 
election will result in a continuity 
in basic primary care strategy by 
whichever party wins it. Everyone 
seems to agree that better healthcare 
hinges on more care being provided 
in the primary care sector. Having more 
doctors and better leveraging of their 
skills through ancillary healthcare 
professionals will require more and 
better premises. We are ready to 
support this essential investment in the 
infrastructure of the NHS by offering the 
right skills, relationships and capital to 
make the plans a reality on the ground.
