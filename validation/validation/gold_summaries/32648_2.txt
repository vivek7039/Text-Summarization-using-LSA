OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
•  Beneﬁts from ongoing investment in a strong brand identity and store reﬁt programme continue, 
delivering an environment to showcase our enhanced product range.
•  E-commerce sales continue to grow, leveraging the process improvements and ‘back-end’ 
infrastructure investments made during the year.
• ‘Tailor Me’ custom tailoring service gaining traction with customers, nationwide.
•  Senior team strengthened during the year with the recruitment of a new Finance Director, Chief 
Operating Ofﬁcer and Customer Director, driving our focus on service delivery.
CURRENT TRADING
•  Retail like-for-like* sales, including VAT, in the ﬁrst 7 weeks of the new ﬁnancial year are up 4.3% 
(7 week period avoids a non LFL Easter bank holiday in week 8 last year).
•  Easter, which marks the start of the wedding season, falls 3 weeks later in 2017, temporarily delaying 
some hire order collections and therefore revenues by three weeks. Hire orders booked for collection in 
2017/18 are currently -1% on the previous year.
•  Hire like for like*, reported on a ‘cash taken’ basis, is -14.3% in the ﬁrst 7 weeks, due to the 
implementation of our “£10 deposit” offer in store. This clearly impacts LFL revenues and means that 
during the early part of the Hire season we are holding a materially smaller value of deposits on a ‘cash 
taken’ basis. 
•  Early responses to the Spring Summer 2017 range across Retail and to the new Hire ranges have been 
good.
• We continue to grow our presence on the high street and online.
• The Group’s trading performance continues in line with the Board’s expectations.
*  Like-for-like (including VAT) represents ﬁnancial information for e-commerce and stores open during both the current and prior ﬁnancial periods and 
compares 52 weeks against 52 weeks, except for stores reﬁtted in the period, where the period closed for reﬁt is excluded from both the current and 
prior ﬁnancial periods. Like-for-like Hire and Tailor Me sales are calculated on cash receipts in the period, before adjustment for the movement in the 
level of deposits held. 
** EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items.
