Chief executive’s review
The Group delivered profit before tax of £14.1m (2016: £9.7m)  
as a result of improved gross profits in the key segments of 
pawnbroking, retail and personal loans. 
THE MARKET
Our marketplace has undergone significant changes in the past 
four years, experiencing peak competition, a falling gold price 
and new regulation causing a number of our competitors to 
restructure their businesses or exit the market. In comparison, 
during 2017 we experienced far more stability allowing us to 
focus on developing our proposition.
OUR STRATEGY
Our Vision: 
H& T will be the premier provider  
of alternative credit in the UK through  
a range of services that help our customers  
rebuild their credit rating and return  
to the mainstream.
The Group’s strategy is to serve a customer base whose access 
to mainstream credit is limited and for whom small-sum loans 
can help to address short-term financial challenges. The Group 
will continue to deliver this strategy by developing a range  
of lending products, both secured and unsecured, offered  
in store and online. In expanding our credit products we aim  
to genuinely help our customers and have updated our vision 
statement to reinforce that vital message within the business.
The development of a diversified suite of services including 
retail, buyback and FX, improves returns and reduces the Group’s 
exposure to gold price volatility.
We continue to innovate and explore how to interact most 
effectively with our customers through the development  
of introducer channels, our online capability and our brand.  
This development is supported by our stores that provides  
our online customer with the opportunity to speak to a trained 
member of staff face to face or to collect an item that they 
reserved online.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Pawnbroking 
Gross profits from pawnbroking increased 4.5% to £29.7m (2016: 
£28.4m) and the gross pledge book increased 11.6% to £46.1m  
(31 December 2016: £41.3m) as a result of the higher gold price, the 
concession format and an increase in loans on quality watches. 
The risk-adjusted margin (revenue as a percentage of the average 
net pledge book) was 68.3% (2016: 72.5%). The reduction in 
risk-adjusted margin is a result of the changing business mix to 
higher value, lower interest rate loans. Redemption of annual 
lending was marginally lower at an estimated 83.6% for lending 
in 2017 (2016 actual: 84.3%).
The pawnbroking segment remains challenging with limited real 
growth in like-for-like stores. There is short-term opportunity  
as a result of the relatively higher gold price and in the medium 
term through further expansion in our concession format and 
lending on high-end products.
The Group has benefitted from the expertise provided by the 
Expert Eye service. This allows high quality images of assets  
in store to be assessed by our team of experts which in turn 
improves both the quality of decisions made and extends the 
range of assets on which we can lend. This has assisted the 
development of watch and diamond lending during the year.
The Group is investing in software to assist the management  
of customer enquiries in respect of pawnbroking as well as the 
acquisition of new partners to introduce customers to the 
business. This investment will allow an expansion to the broker 
and online channels in respect of pawnbroking during 2018.

The Group has produced a strong trading performance  
and made good progress in its strategic development.  
Our intention is to get the best possible result from our 
core operations, develop a range of additional credit 
products and expand the online channel. We have 
delivered against all of those objectives in the past year. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 09

Retail
Retail sales increased 16% to £35.4m (2016: £30.5m), gross profits 
to £12.9m (2016: £11.2m) and margin reduced to 36.3% (2016: 36.8%). 
The Group has invested in store inventories with average 
monthly balances being 12% higher during 2017 than 2016.  
This coupled with control over targeted discounts has resulted 
in the significant improvements in gross profits despite margin 
pressure as a result of increased cost of goods reflecting  
the higher rates on both lending and purchasing activities. 
The development of new-jewellery sales has been particularly 
encouraging with sales increasing by 62% and gross profits  
of £1.3m (2016: £0.9m) as we identify key segments and lines  
to supplement our pre-owned offering.
The est1897 website has been enhanced during the year with 
improved templates, photography and the number of items  
on the site. There are now more than 2000 high-quality  
watches online together with a range of high quality jewellery.  
This enables us to present store inventories to a far wider 
audience and equally, through the use of tablets, we can present 
a far wider range of choice to in-store customers. While in the 
early stages of development we are encouraged by the results 
to date with almost £1m in sales originating on the website 
being completed during 2017 (2016: £0.1m).
We intend to enhance the website further during 2018 with 
greater integration with in-store systems, additional products 
online and improved functionality for the user. 
Personal loans
The net personal loans book has increased by 94.7% to £18.3m  
(31 December 2016: £9.4m). The Board considers revenue less 
impairment to be an important measure of the performance of 
personal loans as it represents the net profit derived directly from 
our lending activities. Revenue less impairment has increased to 
£5.7m (2016: £3.5m) as a result of increased customer numbers and 
the expansion in our longer term, lower interest rate loan product.
The reduction in the risk-adjusted margin (RAM) to 44.9%  
(2016: 55.1%) is the result of the increased proportion of new 
customers, expansion in online and the introduction of our 
lower APR products. Impairment as a percentage of the average 
monthly net loan book has improved to 33.3% (2016: 37.0%) 
reflecting the increased mix of lower yield, higher quality loans. 
This is in line with management expectations for credit quality 
and collections performance.
In line with the strategy of providing larger loans over longer 
terms at a lower interest rate we launched our 49.9% APR 
product in May 2017. This product is designed to provide  
a “near prime” option for our best customers.
The Group now has three distinct products offered both  
in store and online:
• >100% APR loans falling into the high-cost short-term credit 
(HCSTC) definition of the FCA. These loans are intended as the 
starting point of the customer journey with H&T and represent 
the highest volume of loans written as they tend to be lower 
value and shorter term. At 31 December 2017 this segment 
represented approximately 50% of the personal loan book.
• <100% APR loans which are generally provided to customers 
who have established a track record of repayment with H&T.  
At 31 December 2017 this segment represented approximately 
46% of the personal loan book.
• <50% APR loans which are intended to be the final step of the 
journey for our customers as they rebuild their credit rating.  
At 31 December 2017 this segment represented approximately 
4% of the personal loan book.
As a result of these initiatives half of the personal loans loan 
book is now non-HCSTC.
The expansion in other channels of business continues, the net 
online loan book doubled in the year to £1.4m and remains a key 
opportunity for the Group. The broker to store channel is also 
beginning to show positive results as we enhance our customer 
relationship management systems. 
The focus for the Group is to build these alternative sources for 
customers, work is underway to reduce the costs of acquisition 
and processing whilst improving performance.

Pawnbroking scrap
Gross profits reduced to £1.9m (2016: £2.1m). The result in 2016 
was enhanced as a result of the rapid increase in the sterling 
gold price following the EU referendum result.
The average gold price during 2017 was £976 per troy ounce 
(2016: £926), a 5.4% increase. The gold price directly impacts  
the revenue received on the sales of scrapped gold.

Gold purchasing
Gross profits reduced to £3.4m (2016: £3.9m) despite a higher 
volume of gold scrapped in the year.
H&T purchases gold to achieve a particular margin and it takes 
around two months to process items directly to scrap. If the gold 
price increases during this processing period then our margins 
are enhanced, if it reduces then our margins are compressed.
During 2016, the gold price increased by 29% from January to 
December, whereas during the same period in 2017 it fell by 2.2%. 
Accordingly, our margins were considerably lower in 2017 vs 2016.
We estimate that the weight of fine gold purchased in 2017 
increased by approximately 2.1% from 2016 to 2017.
Other services
Other services principally comprises FX, buyback, cheque 
cashing and Western Union. Gross profits from this segment 
increased to £5.9m (2016: £5.6m), as growth in FX and buyback 
was partially offset by declines in Western Union and  
cheque cashing.
The key growth components of FX and buyback improved in the 
year with gross profits from FX increasing to £2.9m (2016: £2.7m) 
and buyback increasing to £1.8m (2016: £1.6m). 
FX is a simple transactional product which attracts a new 
customer base to the business. Improvements to currency 
holdings in store, point of sale materials and the expansion  
of click and collect will enhance this product in the future.
Buyback enables the Group to service a customer base who may 
not have appropriate assets for a pawnbroking loan. The principal 
assets purchased are mobile phones, tablets and games consoles. 
We have invested in system development to support the 
valuation and testing of the items in store. Further work will be 
completed in 2018 to fully integrate those systems and support 
the clicks-to-bricks customer journey.
PROSPECTS
The Group has enhanced its ability to serve a wider customer 
base, both in store and online, with growth in its well-established 
core products and the newer unsecured lending offering.  
This diversified approach to growth reduces the risks inherent  
in any individual objective and positions the Group to capture 
share in this exciting market. Current trading for 2018 is in line 
with management expectations.
I would also like to add my great thanks to those of the 
Chairman, in recognising all of our people whose skills, 
commitment and enthusiasm continue to drive our success,  
and who give us confidence in the future.
