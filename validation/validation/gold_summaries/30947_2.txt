During 2017, we made significant progress with another year 
of record production from our core producing mines. We 
are aiming to continue to drive low cost growth from the 
business over the next few years through a combination 
of new discoveries, optimising our current portfolio and 
potential increased throughput from our plants.
Exciting discovery  
opportunities
We have a pipeline of brownfield 
and greenfield projects in numerous 
locations across three countries in the 
Americas, as well as substantial parcels  
of premium geological land.
