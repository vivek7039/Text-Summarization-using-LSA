Chief Executive’s Report
Carolyn McCall
Chief Executive
I was very pleased to join ITV in January 
as Chief Executive. It is still early days, 
but I have already visited many parts of 
the business and met many very talented 
ITV people. I have visited our ofﬁces in 
London, Manchester and Leeds, a number 
of our newsrooms, production companies 
as well as two cornerstones of our schedule, 
Coronation Street and Emmerdale. I have 
been struck by the pride and passion ITV 
people have for what they do and the 
critical role ITV plays in society and the 
media ecology. 
ITV’s operational performance was strong 
in 2017 in what clearly was a challenging 
year with continued economic and political 
uncertainty impacting the demand for 
television advertising. Share of viewing 
was up for the second year running –  
a ﬁrst ever for ITV; there was a signiﬁcant 
increase in online viewing, up over 30% 
and with good revenue growth; and the 
Studios business also delivered good 
revenue growth both in total, and 
excluding acquisitions.  15

ITV has a strong consumer proposition 
and fantastic content which drives mass 
audiences and key demographics which are 
so valuable to advertisers. It also has the 
potential to do more targeted advertising. 
Live television remains the preferred way 
of watching content, even for younger 
audiences. And it gives immediate scale, 
reach and fame for advertisers that just 
cannot be achieved anywhere else. It also 
provides a safe, trusted and transparent 
environment in which to advertise and 
generates the highest return on investment 
of any media. Recent research by Ebiquity, 
found that for every pound spent, TV 
generates over £4 of proﬁt compared to 
just over £2 for online video and less than 
£1 for online display. 
While online advertising continues to grow, 
advertisers are challenging its effectiveness 
and what it actually delivers – we are now 
starting to see many more questions being 
asked about unacceptable content, 
measurability and trust in online media. 
The Board is proposing a full year dividend 
of 7.8p, up 8% which reflects conﬁdence in 
the business and the outlook for 2018. This 
is in line with ITV’s ordinary dividend policy. 
The business remains highly cash generative 
but given that there is now a more normal 
ordinary dividend, ﬁve consecutive special 
dividends, leverage around 1x and a strategic 
refresh underway, the Board has decided 
not to pay a special dividend for 2017.
ITV is in good shape but we recognise that 
the media landscape continues to change 
rapidly, with more content to watch and 
more ways to watch it. The economics 
are also changing. We are operating in 
an increasingly competitive market – 
traditional broadcasters are no longer our 
only competitors for viewers, for advertising 
and for quality content. These relatively 
‘new’ competitors are also customers. 
We have kicked off a strategy refresh to 
address all of these areas and we have 
identiﬁed three major areas in this refresh – 
content, advertising and direct to consumer. 
We will have a clear strategy, together with 
well-deﬁned priorities, to establish what ITV 
needs to be in three and ﬁve years’ time and 
what we need to do to face the challenges 
and exploit the opportunities ahead. 
 Trauma was a three-part drama broadcast on 
ITV main channel in February 2018 and produced 
by Tall Story Pictures, part of ITV Studios UK.
 Six Nations Rugby Championships was 
successfully broadcast on ITV main channel 
for the second year in 2018. 16 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Netflix and Amazon are important buyers 
of our content – this year, Netflix will 
become the biggest customer of Global 
Entertainment, our distribution business. 
And the focus isn’t just on drama, they also 
want unscripted content in the US. 
And ITV Studios is an international 
production business of scale, with total 
revenues of over £1.5bn – 54% of which 
was generated outside the UK – and is 
active in 11 countries with a library of over 
45,000 hours. We have strong relationships 
through our global production and 
distribution network and sell content 
to over 200 channels globally. 
The ITV Hub delivers a high quality, trusted 
and measured environment for advertisers. 
It also allows us to build direct to consumer 
relationships around our great content and 
programme brands – something we are 
just at the start of – but already we have 
75% of all 16 to 34 year olds registered. 
And through voting and competitions within 
our programmes, we had over 100 million 
interactions last year. 
Creating and owning quality content is 
a real advantage. The integrated producer 
broadcaster model is also a beneﬁt – we have 
a great opportunity to make content famous 
on our channels in the UK before selling it 
round the world. Not only does our success 
on-screen and online depend on having 
fantastic content, but the global demand 
for high quality programming remains strong 
as broadcasters and platform owners look 
for brand deﬁning content. 
 Emmerdale performed strongly in 2017, with 
an average of 6.5 million viewers and a 33% share, 
this was its highest share in four years. 17

 An Hour to Catch a Killer Trevor McDonald 
presented this one-off documentary as part of 
ITV’s Crime and Punishment season broadcast 
on the main channel in 2017.
While the economic outlook remains 
uncertain, we expect ITV Family NAR to 
be positive in the ﬁrst half with Q1 up 1% – 
a continuation of the improvement we saw 
towards the end of 2017. In 2018 we expect 
online to show double digit revenue growth. 
We have kicked off our strategic refresh 
and when we report to you at the interims 
we will be able to give you an update and 
some of the key headlines. In the meantime, 
we remain very focused on the business. 
There is a lot to do and the energy and 
commitment of ITV people both creatively 
and commercially will help us deliver all 
of this. 
We have a solid foundation to build on and 
a strong balance sheet and healthy cash 
flows gives ITV the flexibility to make the 
right strategic decisions for the long term 
future of ITV in an increasingly competitive 
environment whilst still delivering 
sustainable returns to shareholders.

We have had a great start to 2018. 
Viewing has been very strong with a 
schedule including the return of Dancing 
On Ice, The Voice, Vera, Endeavour, Trauma, 
Six Nations rugby, record viewing for our 
key daytime shows and the sixth episode 
of Coronation Street. Our family share of 
viewing, so far, is up 7% and total viewing 
volumes are actually up too by 3% with 
online viewing up 22%. And we have a great 
schedule to come for the rest of the year 
including the FIFA World Cup in June, 
Vanity Fair, Clean Break, White Dragon, 
Britain’s Got Talent and Little Big Shots. 
ITV Studios’ has a great pipeline of new 
and returning shows including Unforgotten, 
Vanity Fair, Survival of the Fittest and I’m 
A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! for ITV, 
Poldark, Bodyguard and Shetland for BBC, 
Living the Dream for Sky and internationally 
Love Island, The Voice, The Chase, Big Star’s 
Little Star, Snowpiercer and Good Witch. 
We have already secured over 60% of our 
expected revenue for 2018, about £100 
million more than this time last year and 
expect to deliver good organic revenue 
growth in ITV Studios over the full year.
 Dancing on Ice returned to ITV in January 2018 
after a four-year break for its tenth series. It has 
been recommissioned for an 11th series.
