European Public Real Estate Association 
(“EPRA”) NAV per share 
The original capex programme commenced just over 
three years ago and is focused on transforming over 
200,000sqm of sub-optimal space. As at 31 March 2017 
approximately 159,000sqm of this space had been 
completely refurbished and was either let or being 
marketed for let. A total of €15.0 million has been 
invested into this space and, at 78% occupancy, is 
generating €8.7 million of annualised rental income 
representing an income return on investment of 58%. 
Recycling of mature and non-core assets
During the year and after the period end, the sale 
of a total of €110.4 million of assets was completed 
or notarised. This included three core mature assets, 
one non-core asset and a land parcel at CöllnParc. 
In order to recycle this equity, further acquisitions 
totalling €72.8 million were either completed or 
notarised after the year end.

In March 2017 the Company completed the successful 
move of its shares from AIM to being admitted for
