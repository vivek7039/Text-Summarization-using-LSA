Chief Executive’s Review
We have delivered signiﬁcant business 
improvement across our brands, assets, 
infrastructure, organisation and our 
teams, to support the successful 
long-term development of the Company.
The unexpected and unwelcome 
announcement of a new punitive tax 
regime associated with the manufacture 
of soft drinks with added sugar had the 
potential to be a major business 
distraction. However, I am pleased to 
report that we have continued to place 
consumers at the heart of our business, 
not regulators, and have responded 
positively to changing consumer tastes 
and preferences across our portfolio. 
We will of course continue to work with 
the various government bodies involved 
in the new regime to ensure that this 
new regulatory environment is deployed 
appropriately and with as much 
common sense as possible.
In this reporting period:
 – We maintained overall market share 
in UK soft drinks with total Group 
revenue of £257.1m, an underlying* 
increase of 1.5% on the previous year.
 – Proﬁt before tax increased 4.4% on 
the prior year to £43.1m.
 – Statutory proﬁt before tax and 
exceptional items* increased 2.7%  
on the prior year to £42.4m.
 – Operating margin before exceptional 
items* improved 50bps to 16.8% 
following our continued tight  
cost control.
 – Our deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme 
was closed to future accrual further 
reducing our corporate risk proﬁle.
 – Beneﬁts from our Fit for the Future 
enabling programme began to ﬁlter 
through as planned, including 
signiﬁcantly better customer service, 
tighter inventory management and 
the implementation of a Company-
wide reorganisation.
 – Strong cash ﬂow resulted in a net 
cash position of £9.7m.
Soft drinks market performance
The UK soft drinks market has 
performed robustly across the last 12 
months, with growth of 1.2% in value and 
1.6% in volume. This total market position 
masks a higher degree of volatility than 
in prior years, both in terms of monthly 
market movements and individual 
sub-category performance.
As we previously forecast, deﬂation has 
eased across the latter part of the year. 
However, the more structural element  
of this deﬂation, related to the continued 
growth of the lower value water 
category, has continued to impact the 
total market. Stills experienced volume 
growth of just over 3% and value growth 
of 1%, with water growth continuing to 
be the driving force. In contrast, the 
carbonates sector experienced modest 
inﬂation, growing value by just over 1% 
versus a ﬂat volume position. 
Clarity of  
purpose
During the past 12 months our thirst for improvement 
has continued, despite the numerous external challenges 
that we have had to overcome. 09

Strategic Report
The past year has seen a number  
of material changes to the macro 
environment in which we operate  
– the soft drinks sugar tax, the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU, the devaluation 
of sterling and increased geopolitical 
volatility. However, perhaps most 
important to our business are the 
continuing development of UK 
consumer preferences in soft drinks, the 
further consolidation and development 
of our customer environment and  
ﬁnally, the advances across the digital 
communication landscape we operate 
in. We have continued to respond 
positively and with pace to these 
changes, focusing on the opportunities 
that arise.
Our long-standing reformulation and 
product development programme has 
seen our portfolio develop signiﬁcantly 
across the past year. In March 2017  
we announced our intention to meet 
consumers’ changing tastes and 
preferences with a number of further 
signiﬁcant portfolio developments.  
The successful development and  
launch of Rubicon Spring and IRN-BRU 
XTRA have contributed to our forward 
development plans, giving us the  
insight and conﬁdence to announce  
our intention that over 90% of Company 
owned brands will contain less than 5g 
of total sugars per 100ml by the autumn 
of 2017. This is a signiﬁcant and positive 
move which supports our consumer-
focused strategy, at the same time  
as reducing our overall exposure to 
regulatory changes.
During the course of the last ﬁnancial 
year our key brands have beneﬁted from 
continued investment and innovation. 
IRN-BRU and Rubicon in particular exit 
the full year with strong momentum 
based on positive brand fundamentals.
Strategy
In times of elevated uncertainty, clarity  
of purpose and consistency of approach 
yield the best outcome in our experience. 
We have remained consistent to our 
approach and principles across the past 
year, focusing on:
 – strongly diŽerentiated brands;
 – eŽective and ﬂexible operations;
 – innovation based on consumer 
understanding;
 – growth driven partnerships; and 
 – leveraging the strength and 
commitment of our teams.
In each of these areas we have  
invested eŽort and resources to  
drive improvement and thus increase 
competitiveness. Our innovation has 
been instrumental in building our 
portfolio into the lower and no sugar 
consumer space and our technical 
developments in this area are critical  
to our future success. Our investment  
in our assets and infrastructure has 
continued with the introduction of new 
glass ﬁlling capability at Cumbernauld 
and the announcement of our intention 
to extend PET capability to our Milton 
Keynes site. This gives us a ﬂexible 
platform to improve our service, control 
our costs and ensure we are capable  
of adapting our operations to meet  
the portfolio needs of the future.
Our core partnerships, with Rockstar 
and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, have 
continued to develop across the period, 
with notable extensions to the territories 
covered under our Rockstar agreement. 
In September 2016 we signed a further 
exclusive extension with Rockstar for a 
further seven territories, including the 
Russian Federation. The Snapple brand 
has enjoyed growth of over 20% across 
2016/17, with signiﬁcant product 
innovation, packaging advancements

and further distribution growth in the 
UK and internationally. The expansion  
of these selective partnerships remains 
an important part of our long-term 
growth strategy.
We have enjoyed an excellent 
performance from our Funkin cocktail 
business building on the strong progress 
made last year, our ﬁrst year of 
ownership. The Funkin team has 
continued to deliver excellent 
opportunities to customers to access 
cocktail market growth with simplicity, 
authenticity and excitement. We 
anticipate continued growth for the 
Funkin business in the traditional 
on-trade environment and also from  
our planned launch into retail, with a 
new ready to mix cocktail product format 
which has exciting brand development 
and growth potential for the future. 
It has been a very busy, and at times 
unsettling, year for many of our 
colleagues as we have implemented 
signiﬁcant levels of change, culminating 
in a Company-wide reorganisation 
programme in the ﬁnal quarter. 
Following our prior year investment in 
assets and systems, the reorganisation 
has allowed us to streamline and 
improve our organisational structure, 
reducing employee numbers by around 
10% whilst improving operating 
eŽectiveness and ﬂexibility. I would like 
to thank all our teams across the 
business who have responded positively 
to the challenges we face and have now 
helped to create a stronger business, 
more capable of delivering against our 
long-term potential.
Summary
We have made considerable progress 
across the business over the last 12 
months and delivered a solid ﬁnancial 
performance in volatile and uncertain 
market conditions. The growth drivers  
of our core brands, innovation, 
partnerships, Funkin and International 
remain at the heart of our future plans. 
We are operating from a well-invested 
and sustainable asset base, with our new 
organisational structures established to 
support growth. We will continue to 
seek opportunities to grow shareholder 
value by utilising our full suite of options 
– our organic growth potential, our 
strong balance sheet, our core 
competencies and our strong culture 
– and I believe we are well placed to 
continue to deliver consistent long-term 
shareholder value.
