Strategy 
I am delighted to be leading this ambitious 
business at such an exciting time in its history.
2016/17 was a significant year for easyHotel 
with excellent progress achieved across all 
areas of the business. Impressive like-for-like 
sales growth was delivered, underpinned by the 
smooth implementation of our new booking 
engine and yield management system across 
the entire easyHotel network. We opened five 
new hotels during the year in our new stylish 
brand format, all of which have traded strongly 
from opening. The increase in sales and new 
openings, together with our focus on reducing 
costs, improving efficiencies and maximising 
the returns from our investments, have produced 
a significant growth in our underlying profits.
Our pipeline of new hotels is accelerating. 
The successful equity fundraise in October 2016 
is enabling us to develop and open more owned 
hotels and such investment in the brand and 
estate should in turn encourage more franchisees 
to join the brand. 
With the experienced team we now have in place, 
continued high levels of staff engagement and 
improving customer satisfaction, we are in an 
excellent position to expand the easyHotel brand 
and deliver improving returns for our shareholders. 
Trading review 
Total system sales grew by 39.2% to £29.7m 
with Company revenues increasing by 39.7% 
to £8.4m. This was achieved through like-for-like 
owned and franchised hotel sales growth of 
9.8% as well as the opening of new owned 
hotels in Birmingham and Manchester, and 
franchised hotels in Brussels, Amsterdam Arena 
and Amsterdam Zaandam. Occupancy for 
all owned and franchised hotels was 79.7% 
(2016: 76.2%). The five hotels opened in the 
new brand style have all traded very strongly 
since opening, with a combined occupancy 
in excess of 85%. We will continue to monitor 
their progress closely and the impact on the 
time taken for new hotels to reach maturity in 
future. Our strong sales performance led to 
a 48.3% increase in adjusted EBITDA to 
£2.30m (2016: £1.55m). 
Owned hotels 
Our owned hotels continued to win market 
share with revenue growing by 13.7% on a 
like-for-like basis. The new booking engine 
and revenue management system rollout, 
together with selling an allocation of rooms 
via selected online travel agencies (OTAs), 
resulted in our owned hotels significantly 
outperforming their competitive set (as measured 
by STR) throughout the year. As previously 
announced, the Board plans to retain a 92-room 
hotel at Old Street and is applying for planning 
permission to add additional floors to the building 
for use as office accommodation which should 
maximise value from this freehold property. 
We have started a £1.5m refurbishment of our 
other two legacy owned assets in Croydon and 
Glasgow, to improve the quality of the hotels 
and to bring them into line with our new brand 
look. We expect their refurbishment to be revenue 
enhancing during the current financial year.
Franchise partners
Like-for-like revenue at our franchised hotels 
increased by 8.6% during the financial year, 
with total currency adjusted sales increasing 
by 32.2%. The hotels in Continental Europe 
performed particularly strongly. Dubai, Luton 
and Heathrow were refurbished during the 
year and we are discussing refurbishment 
plans with a number of other franchisees 
to introduce the new brand look and feel. 
There were 20 franchised hotels operating 
in our network at 30 September 2017 . 
Market outlook 
The UK hotel market performed strongly in 
201 7 with Sterling’s weakness (versus the US Dollar 
and Euro) resulting in an increase in staycations 
and inbound tourism. London’s RevPAR growth 
was particularly strong during the first half of 
the year and, encouragingly, regional RevPAR 
has also improved. The European hotel market 
continued to perform strongly during the financial 
year. Growth in Europe is still being predominantly 
driven by occupancy, which suggests a healthy 
supply and demand balance and scope for 
further rate increases.
The Board remains confident that despite any 
uncertainties surrounding the current Brexit 
negotiations, the easyHotel brand will continue 
to outperform its hotel sector as consumers 
seek out the best value for money.
Development review 
Development of owned hotels 
We have a growing pipeline of hotels under 
development. Barcelona and Ipswich, both 
acquired last year, will open in mid-2018.
During the year and post year end, we secured 
a further five new hotel sites in aggregate which 
are listed below: 
 • Lands Lane, Leeds, acquired under a 250-year 
ground lease. The 93-room hotel will open in 
mid-2018. 
 • High Street, Sheffield, acquired on a freehold 
basis. The 131-room hotel will open in 
mid-2018. 
 • Oxford, a 25-year lease, subject to planning 
permission. The 180-room hotel should open 
during the next financial year. 
 • Central Cardiff, acquired on a freehold basis, 
subject to planning permission. The 120-room 
hotel will open in 2019. 
 • Tune hotel in Newcastle – we agreed to take 
over a 25-year lease of a 104-room hotel, 
opening as an easyHotel this month. 
Recently opened hotels, with our new and 
improved design, are performing better than 
their original business case, whilst industry wide 
construction cost inflation has generally added 
to our owned hotel project costs. On aggregate 
these projects are still expected to deliver an 
unlevered return on capital employed (ROCE) 
of 12–13%.

Transforming our business
Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s review Together with leased hotel projects, 
considered on a limited and specific basis 
where the acquisition of a suitable freehold 
site is not currently available or does not meet 
our investment return targets, and our new 
franchised hotels, which are delivering more 
fees than initially anticipated, we expect to 
deliver a 15% unlevered blended ROCE 
at Group level.
We have 921 owned rooms under development 
and following the successful £38m (gross) 
equity placing in October 2016, and the £12m 
refinancing of an existing bank facility, the Group’s 
asset-backed balance sheet remains strong but 
with our current development pipeline we are 
only able to finance one further owned hotel. 
We continue to see a good number of attractive 
potential development opportunities to further 
accelerate the Group’s growth. Consequently, the 
Board is considering its financing options, which 
may include new equity and debt, to fund 
these opportunities.
Development of franchised hotels
There are 1,798 franchised rooms currently 
under development. The 101-room hotel in 
Lisbon, the 100-room hotel in Bernkastel-Kues, 
the 81-room hotel in Belfast, the 87-room hotel 
in The Hague – Scheveningen, the 75-room 
hotel in Maastricht and the 54-room hotel 
in Reading will all open in 2018. We also 
announced the development of hotels in 
Bur Dubai (300 rooms), Istanbul (300 rooms), 
Iran (500 rooms) and Sri Lanka (200 rooms) 
beyond 2018. These hotel openings will enhance 
our position as the super budget hotel brand of 
scale, in the UK, Europe and the Middle East.
Pipeline
In addition to the 2,719 owned and franchised 
rooms we currently have under development, 
we have extended our pipeline during the year, 
with over 2,300 owned and leased rooms under 
negotiation, including c.1,000 owned and leased 
rooms approved by the Board, as well as a further 
c.1,300 franchised rooms under negotiation. 
This confirms our strategic analysis that there 
is the potential in the UK and Europe for a total 
of 12,000 owned and leased rooms and for a 
total of 15,000 franchised rooms. The potential 
for franchised development outside the UK 
and Europe is yet to be fully assessed; however, 
recent franchised activity and enquiries in the 
Middle East, Africa and Asia have indicated 
that there is strong demand for the easyHotel 
brand outside Europe.
Capability review
It is essential that we continue to build the 
capability of the business, ensuring we have 
the right platform in place to support our 
ambitious growth plans.
Organisation and culture
To grow as a business and succeed on all fronts 
we continue to enhance our organisation and 
culture. We fully recognise and endorse the need 
for dynamic leadership with clear executive 
accountability and a relentless customer focus. 
Having appointed a new senior team last year, 
to ensure that we have the right breadth of talent 
in place to deliver our growth plans going forward, 
our focus this year has been on ensuring that all 
our team members feel valued and recognised 
and have the opportunity and support to reach 
their full potential. 
With such an exciting future, it is perhaps not 
surprising that our staff engagement score was 
82% during the year. At the year end the Group 
employed 50 staff (2016: 45). 
Brand strength
easyHotel’s core strength is our ability to 
leverage the recognised and trusted “easy” 
brand. We know that improving customer 
recommendation is a priority for our future 
success and finding out what our customers think 
is central to our business. Our operations teams 
focus on customer feedback via social media 
sites in general, and TripAdvisor in particular, 
and our hotels are ranked against a competitive 
set on a monthly basis. The Group TripAdvisor 
score at the year end was 3.5 (2016: 3.3). 
This relentless focus on customer feedback is 
already paying off and will remain an integral 
part of the way we do things in the future.
Technology 
Although we are now selling a controlled 
number of rooms via OTAs, we remain focused 
on driving sales via our own website. Our new 
booking engine will allow us to launch a new 
website and mobile app and introduce automated 
check-in kiosks, to improve every stage of the 
customer journey online and at our hotels. 
Our marketing campaigns will be further 
refined to maximise the traffic to our website 
and improve the return on our marketing 
investment. With a new revenue management 
system in place, we will be in an excellent 
position to make further improvements to our 
customers’ web journey, as well as introduce a 
more dynamic pricing strategy to further drive 
RevPAR growth. By offering our customers a 
good night’s sleep at a super price and a quick 
and easy way to make a booking, we believe 
that we will attract new customers and 
encourage significant repeat visits.
Our values 
At easyHotel we believe that it’s not just what 
we do, but how we do it. We believe in providing 
our teams an opportunity to build a great career, 
in providing our customers with a truly super 
budget stay and giving our shareholders a 
great return on their investment.
I want to take this opportunity to thank every 
employee across the Group and our business 
partners for making easyHotel as good as it is. 
I’m confident that, together, we can continue to 
deliver on our strategic objectives in the months 
and years ahead.
