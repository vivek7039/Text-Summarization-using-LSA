Dr Mike Love 
Non-Executive Chairman
the Group has accelerated its acquisition 
intangibles amortisation by £0.459m  
taking total amortisation to £0.838m  
(2016: £0.379m).
The Board has raised £0.400m from the 
Directors and PDMRs (person discharging 
managerial responsibilities) in the form of a 
convertible loan note to provide continued 
funding for GatedTalent.The loan notes carry 
an interest rate of 8.15% and a conversion 
price of 71.6p. The loan note has a 3-year 
duration but with various rights for early 
conversion or repayment. 
Dividends
In view of the fund raising carried out to 
develop GatedTalent, we did not pay an 
interim dividend. However we propose paying 
a final dividend of 0.5p (2016: 2.8p) subject 
to Shareholder approval. The dividend will 
be payable on 13 July 2018 to Shareholders 
on the register on 15 June 2018. Shares will 
trade ex dividend from 14 June 2018. Future 
dividends will depend on Group performance. 
Staff
Our staff are fundamental to our success. 
It is through their efforts, commitment and 
determination that we continue to be a leading 
technology provider in the sectors we serve. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all of our staff for their 
individual and collective contributions during 
2017 and for the huge effort demonstrated 
during the early months of 2018, supporting 
our GDPR related projects.
Outlook
Both our Dillistone Systems and Voyager 
Software divisions have enjoyed strong demand 
for our products and services during the first 
quarter of 2018. The Board is delighted to note 
that, while Voyager revenues will clearly be 
impacted by the previously announced loss of 
a legacy contract, Q1 2018 saw one of its best 
ever quarters in terms of new contract wins.
After a slow January, orders for Dillistone 
Systems’ FileFinder product improved 
significantly in February and March and ended 
the quarter more than 25% up on the same 
period in 2017. Many of these orders were 
driven by demand for our GatedTalent product 
which features exclusive integration with 
FileFinder Anywhere.
In our 27 February announcement, we 
revealed that we had achieved the milestone 
of 100 clients for our GatedTalent service. 
We continue to see strong demand for the 
platform, with more than 160 firms having 
now signed contracts. The division has now 
generated its first subscription revenue.
Long term revenue growth from the 
GatedTalent platform will be derived from 
interactions with executives who register with 
the service and create a profile. Executives 
join to be “On the radar” of our executive 
recruiter clients. They may register directly at 
www.GatedTalent.com or via an invitation from 
a Search firm – these invitations are typically 
sent as part of an executive recruiter’s GDPR 
compliancy process.  
The platform is working well and as expected 
and the throughput on the GatedTalent 
platform is growing month on month and is 
expected to accelerate rapidly over the period 
to the end of July. The number of profiles is 
also growing and is also expected to increase 
quickly over the coming months. 
Having originally anticipated that our clients 
would send around 1 million invitations, our 
current belief is that the number of invitations 
will be around 3 million. The majority of 
our clients are expected to leave mailing 
of compliancy messages as late as legally 
possible and, despite the thousands of 
messages already sent, we believe that the vast 
majority of our clients will not send messages 
before May, with a number of firms likely to 
complete the process in June or even July. 
We are seeing significant variances in invitation 
conversion rates between clients. Some firms 
are seeing in excess of 8% of invitations 
leading to Profiles; others are seeing a fraction 
of 1% converting. What is apparent from the 
Profiles that have been created so far, however, 
is that our executive talent pool will be both 
senior and diverse. Currently, the three most 
common Job Titles for our Executives are 
“CEO”, “Managing Director” and “General 
Manager”. We have onboarded profiles from 
executives in 75 countries. A heatmap with 
further information on profile data is available 
at www.gatedtalent.com/metrics/.
The Group has paid dividends throughout its 
time as a public company and, having ended 
the year with cash of £1.390m, the Board is 
pleased to be in a position to pay a dividend of 
0.5p per share.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
For the year ended 31 December 2017
2017 was an exciting year for the 
Dillistone Group with the launch of 
GatedTalent (www.GatedTalent.com) 
on 9 October 2017 at the World 
Executive Search Congress. 
Our business has traditionally been involved in 
the supply of technology to the recruiting and 
associated sectors. GatedTalent is a private 
network – a tool which allows executives to 
share information with trusted recruiters. It is 
a first for our Group and has the potential to 
transform the nature of the Group’s underlying 
business model from software to data. 
More generally, trading across the Group was 
challenging in 2017, although we did see some 
improvement in operational performance in the 
second half of the year – despite the increasing 
costs associated with GatedTalent. Overall, 
Group revenue fell 4% to £9.582m, of which 
recurring revenue grew 6% to £7.474m. 
Adjusted operating profit dropped significantly 
to £0.309m in part due to the investment 
made in GatedTalent and in part due to a 
decline in new licence sales. Excluding our 
GatedTalent investment, the Group remained 
cash generative across this year.
As anticipated in our Interim statement, a 
SaaS contract with a major client expired in 
early 2018. This contract, with a client using 
a legacy product acquired as a result of an 
acquisition made several years ago, was 
worth in the region of £600,000 per annum in 
contribution terms to the Group. Consequently,  www.dillistonegroup.com 07 www.dillistonegroup.com 07
What is GatedTalent?
Imagine a private database of the world’s global executives. Imagine if this database included detailed, private information on those executives – 
including biographical, aspirational and often compensation data. Imagine if the database was curated by the executives themselves in a manner 
that made it entirely GDPR friendly. Imagine if the information provided by the executive was enhanced by detailed company data. And imagine 
that database offered seamless two-way integration with the leading executive search CRM. And... one more thing. Imagine this database was 
huge. And global. That’s what GatedTalent is. 
How does it work?
Virtually any executive recruiter storing 
information covered by the GDPR will need 
to go through a process of confirming and 
proving that their data is legal. As part 
of this process, they will typically make 
contact with huge numbers of executives 
they store in their databases. GatedTalent 
will manage this process and then, 
optionally, will invite the executive to create 
a detailed – but private – profile which 
will be shared only with recruiters that the 
executive has chosen to trust. Recruiters 
using the platform will earn credits for any 
executives who they introduce and who go 
on to create a profile – those credits may 
be used to search the anonymised database 
of “unconnected executives” and make 
connection requests to executives who are 
currently not known to the firm.
How is this different to LinkedIn  
or Xing?
LinkedIn and Xing are both social networks. 
Any information uploaded to these 
platforms is essentially publicly available. 
That means that many of the most senior 
executives do not use these networks – and 
they wouldn’t dream of sharing private 
data such as compensation on an open 
platform. With GatedTalent, search firms 
make connection requests and executives 
say YES or NO. It’s as simple as that. 
Executives control who sees some, all or 
none of their data.
How is it different to other online 
services that are designed to 
allow executives to network with 
recruiters?
Over the course of 2018, our executive 
search firm clients will invite around 3 
million executives to join the platform. 
The largest comparable product – the 
AESC’s Bluesteps – has about 115,000 
profiles within it, despite having been in 
existence for around a decade. We are 
confident that, within a year, our data pool 
will be close to or larger and more up to 
date than Bluesteps. It will then continue 
to grow, because – for the thousands of 
FileFinder users worldwide – the database 
will be fully integrated with everything they 
do. Our users will find executives in the 
platform and so executives will want to be 
in the platform. Furthermore – unlike most 
products in this space – we’ll never charge 
the executives. We don’t believe that the 
world’s most senior executives need to pay 
to interact with search firms.
