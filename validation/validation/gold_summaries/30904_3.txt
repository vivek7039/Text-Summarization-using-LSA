 Who we are
Morgan Sindall Group is a leading UK construction and 
regeneration group. We offer support at every stage of a 
project’s life cycle through our six divisions of Construction & 
Infrastructure, Fit Out, Property Services, Partnership Housing, 
Urban Regeneration and Investments.
What we do An overview of our market Our Group strategy
Our construction services 
include design, new build, fit out, 
refurbishment and property 
maintenance, working on 
standalone projects or through 
strategic alliances. In regeneration 
we work in close partnership with 
landowners, local authorities and 
housing associations to revive cities 
with mixed-use developments.
Four macroeconomic trends 
will support long-term growth in 
the Group: the housing shortage; 
investment in infrastructure; 
population growth; and pressure 
on the public sector to achieve 
savings in managing their assets. 
We target growing markets 
that match our expertise.
We specialise in construction 
and regeneration, investing cash 
from our construction activities 
in long-term regeneration 
programmes. This strategy is 
supported by our objectives of 
winning work, retaining talented 
people, a disciplined use of 
capital, maximising resources 
and innovating.

Our structure and approach Our core values and commitments How we manage our business
We are a decentralised 
organisation. Our divisions have 
the autonomy to meet the needs 
of their markets and the flexibility 
to innovate and react quickly to 
opportunities. The Group is also 
cohesive. Our divisions achieve 
synergies by sharing opportunities 
and collaborating on schemes.
We share one set of core values 
throughout the Group that guide 
our approach to everything we 
do. Aligned to these values, our 
Group-wide Total Commitments 
to being a responsible business 
support our strategy and are 
measured against performance 
targets.
We measure our performance 
using financial and non-financial 
performance indicators related to 
our strategic objectives. Principal 
risks are identified and managed 
at divisional and Group level. 
Our risk governance system is 
designed to ensure that risks 
are reviewed at every level.
