 CREATING FRANCHISES
In 2013 we set out our plan to transition 
the business from work-for-hire to 
multi-franchise self-publication. The 
rise of digital distribution was the 
catalyst for our change, and our 
extensive experience in the games 
industry gave us the confi dence to 
make the switch.
Four years later I am delighted with 
our achievements; we have overcome 
a number of challenges to transform 
our business model with two successful 
franchises, Planet Coaster and 
Elite Dangerous already in the market, 
and more to come. Our next major 
development, Jurassic World Evolution, 
is progressing well, and is scheduled 
for launch in summer 2018. I would like 
to thank our amazing team who have 
achieved so much since our decision to 
transition our business four years ago.
THE GAMES MARKET
We operate in an exciting industry. The games 
market is now the premier form of 
entertainment worth over $100bn per year, 
in the wider $300bn entertainment industry. 
That’s larger than each of the fi lm, TV or music 
industries, with the games sector overtaking 
fi lm in 2017. The games sector is growing 
fast, increasing at 8% per year, with TV 
experiencing a decline of 8%.
Today the games market is split into three 
roughly comparable sectors by revenue: 
PC, console and mobile. However, the 
characteristics of each sector are quite 
different. Frontier has chosen to prioritise 
the PC and console sectors where audiences 
value high quality games, and that quality is 
a key determinant of success. In contrast the 
mobile sector is overcrowded, so success 
can be a lot more hit-and-miss.
The whole market is moving rapidly to digital 
downloads. Mobile and PC are now almost 
100% digital, and consoles are at approximately 
50% but are quickly moving to digital downloads, 
as focus moves from older consoles to the 
new generation, and older business models 
are gradually replaced.
There are already some very large and well 
established companies in the games market; 
for example EA and Activision Blizzard both 
based in the US, who have a combined value 
of over $80 billion. The nature of our industry 
is change and evolution, and it is interesting 
to see the rapid development of companies 
like Valve Inc (with their Steam platform) in 
the US and Tencent in China, based on their 
focus on the opportunities that digital 
distribution presents. It is also clear that 
the model Frontier has already adopted 
– supporting our games continually with 
community and regular updates: essentially 
‘games as a service’ – is working very well,

HAVE ACHIEVED SO MUCH

and has meant that the two franchises 
already released have continued to perform.
STRATEGY 
We believe that publishing our own franchises 
is the best way to maximise the benefi t of 
our core skills and our assets and our COBRA 
technology platform. The Company’s focus 
is on developing top quality self-published 
PC and console titles for digital distribution, 
as together these segments represent the 
majority of the available market by revenue. 
Generally the audiences on these platforms 
value high quality games, and quality is one 
of Frontier’s key development strengths.
We will also continue to follow our repeatable 
model; to create further franchises in potentially 
successful but under-served sectors where 
we have key expertise and knowledge and/
or IP, in order to further build our revenue 
pipeline over the long term.
Our strategic objective is to create long-term 
sustainable growth through success in a 
multi-franchise self-publication business 
model. Our strategic focus is on two key areas:
• developing our business to achieve 
repeatable success; and
• creating and managing franchises
Further detail is set out in the strategy 
section of this report, but I’d like to briefl y 
comment on the fi rst area.
FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 04 We believe that developing our business to 
achieve repeatable success requires scale. 
Over time we aim to double our output, from 
roughly one major launch every two years, 
to one every 12 months or so. To do this we 
will grow our capability to accelerate our 
progress, although it does not mean we 
need to double our workforce. We have 
established a scale-up plan, to expand 
our team and to invest in facilities and 
organisational development.
Strong partnerships have always been vital 
to our success. In our past as a work-for-hire 
developer we worked successfully with many 
prestigious industry partners including Atari, 
Lucasfilm, Microsoft and Sony, and became 
well-known in the games industry for our 
development track-record of innovation, 
quality and delivery.
Our new business model of self-publication 
has required us to build new partnerships. 
Our commercial partners now include 
Valve Inc (with its Steam platform), Humble 
Store and the distribution channel teams 
at both Microsoft and Sony; we are also 
excited to be partnering with Universal on 
the Jurassic World Evolution project.
I look forward to working with Frontier’s 
people and our partners to build on our 
early self-publishing success and establish 
a new long-term, self-published track record 
of quality, innovation and delivery as we 
scale-up to create a multi-franchise 
success story.

CURRENT TRADING 
AND OUTLOOK
The Board have been encouraged by trading since the year end (31 May 2017). 
The number of players of Frontier’s games continues to grow. In August 2017, 
Planet Coaster, which launched in November 2016, passed 1 million cumulative 
unit sales, and Elite Dangerous, which launched in December 2014, exceeded 
2.75 million cumulative franchise unit sales. 
We have further expanded the addressable audience for Elite Dangerous by 
launching on PlayStation 4 in June 2017. During the summer Planet Coaster 
and Elite Dangerous participated in successful price promotions on our major 
distribution channels with the Steam and Xbox Summer Sale events. These 
events were in turn supported by major updates for each game as we followed 
our strategy of continuing to further enhance the experiences they deliver. 
We launched our first in-game Paid Downloadable Content (PDLC) for Planet 
Coaster in July 2017, and announced that Elite Dangerous 2.4 ‘The Return’ will 
be released in September 2017 which supports the on-going story arc related 
to Thargoids, the franchise’s first alien species.
In August 2017 we announced that our third franchise, Jurassic World Evolution, 
will launch in summer 2018 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One simultaneously. 
In 2015, Universal Pictures’ Jurassic World became one of the biggest blockbusters 
in cinema history, grossing more than $1.67billion at the global box office on its way 
to becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time. Jurassic World Evolution will 
launch in the year that Universal Pictures’ celebrates the 25th anniversary of the 
original Jurassic Park film, and the next chapter of the franchise Jurassic World: 
Fallen Kingdom will be in theatres June 2018.
We anticipate that the next step-up in our financial performance will be delivered 
by the launch of Jurassic World Evolution in summer 2018. The Board currently 
expect that the majority of initial revenues from this new franchise will fall into 
the financial year ending 31 May 2019, as the Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom 
movie is released in June 2018. The Board therefore anticipates that trading in 
the current financial year, the twelve months ending 31 May 2018, will principally 
be based on sales from the Elite Dangerous and Planet Coaster franchises.
The Board is excited about the growth opportunities ahead in the coming years, as 
existing franchises continue to be strengthened and new franchises are developed 
and launched. Frontier is developing, evolving and investing in our people, 
organisational structure and facilities to effectively create, develop, market and 
sell even more distinct franchises aimed at different audience segments to achieve 
the Company’s ambition to create a self-publishing multi-franchise success story.
