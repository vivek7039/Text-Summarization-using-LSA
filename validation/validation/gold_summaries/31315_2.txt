Commenting on the results, Tom Burnet, Executive Chairman of accesso, said:  
 
“This has been another strong year. We continue to execute on our strategy with precision and focus, and we are continuing to see the 
rewards.  
 
Our financial performance was ahead of our expectations, and our resilience as a global business is becoming more evident. Our clients 
are increasingly seeing the benefit we bring to their customers, and in turn their own profitability. This is evidenced by today’s results 
with another profitable period for our own growth at Accesso. 
 
We have pushed boundaries this year as we continued to focus on investment, building and improving our business, and finding new 
ways to support the digital customer journey. Two important strategic acquisitions present us with many more opportunities, and we 
are excited about the new markets they open up for us as well as how they can support our existing customer base.  
 
I am excited by where we are as an organisation, and I see enormous growth opportunities in our future.” 
 
Commenting on the results, Steve Brown, Chief Executive Officer of accesso, said: 
 
“These results speak to the quality of our technology and our ability to create innovative solutions for our customers. Ensuring the 
quality of our product offering in terms of both functionality and security remains a key part of our ongoing plan and we will invest 
behind our platform to make certain of our continued leadership in this area. 
 
The acquisitions we made in 2017 have both broadened and strengthened our offering, and our approach to M&A reflects our continued 
ambition to bring the best technology, people and ideas to Accesso. 
 
Having decided to step down from my role as CEO, I know I am leaving the Group in fantastic hands. Accesso has an extremely bright 
future ahead with Paul Noland at the helm.”
