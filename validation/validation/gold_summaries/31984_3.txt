CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Caroline Connellan joined Brooks 
Macdonald as Chief Executive in 
April succeeding Chris Macdonald, 
who remains on the board in a 
non‑executive capacity. Caroline 
brings more than 20 years’ 
experience in the financial services 
industry, most recently as Head of UK 
Premier and Wealth at HSBC. She 
joins the group at an exciting point in 
its development.
Our discretionary funds under 
management grew substantially 
during the year, surpassing the 
significant milestone of £10bn in April 
2017 and reaching £10.5bn as at 
30 June 2017 (2016: £8.3bn), an 
increase of 25.9%. This compares to a 
10.5% increase in the FTSE UK Private 
Investor Balanced Index and 
represents a combination of 
investment performance (14.5%) and 
continued organic growth (11.5%).
Underlying profit before tax for the 
year was £18.4m (2016: £15.5m), an 
increase of 18.6% on the previous 
year, representing an underlying 
profit margin of 20.1% (2016: 19.1%). 
Underlying earnings per share also 
increased by 31.7% to 115.76p (2016: 
87 .92p). Statutory profit before tax for 
the year fell by 49.3% to £8.0m (2016: 
£15.9m), predominantly due to the 
decision to deal proactively with 
certain legacy matters arising from 
the former Spearpoint business, as 
explained in the Chief Executive’s 
Review. We have announced the 
sale of Braemar Estates, our 
property management division, 
which will enable us to focus on our 
core businesses. 
The board has recommended a final 
dividend of 26.0p (2016: 23.0p) which, 
subject to approval by shareholders, 
will result in total dividends for the 
year of 41.0p (2016: 35.0p). This 
represents an increase of 17 .1% on the 
previous year and reaffirms the 
board’s confidence in the strength of 
the business and our commitment 
to a progressive dividend policy. 
The final dividend will be paid on 
27 October 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 
29 September 2017 .
Richard Spencer and Simon 
Wombwell are not seeking re-election 
to the board at this year’s AGM, 
although both will continue as key 
members of the Group Executive 
Committee, as Chief Investment 
Officer and Head of UK Distribution 
respectively. This will reduce the 
board to nine, made up of five 
non-executive directors and four 
executive directors, a board 
composition in line with current 
corporate governance practice.
The financial services industry is 
going through an unprecedented 
period of regulatory change, which 
will have a profound impact on 
businesses throughout the sector. 
We recognise the demands this places 
on the business and consequently 
will be increasing investment in 
regulatory and risk management 
capabilities as outlined in the Chief 
Executive’s Review below. This will 
provide a strong foundation, 
positioning the business for future 
growth.
The result of the EU referendum in 
2016 and the subsequent UK General 
Election in June 2017 have begun to 
impact on the UK’s macroeconomic 
outlook and uncertainty surrounding 
the nature of the UK’s future 
relationship with the EU will persist 
over the next eighteen months as 
negotiations with the EU continue. 
We have already seen a fall in 
consumer spending. These factors, 
combined with the global geopolitical 
risks that have recently begun to 
weigh on market sentiment, cause us 
to remain cautious in our external 
outlook. Nevertheless, the Group is 
well-positioned to weather any 
turbulence, with a strong balance 
sheet (net cash £32.2m (2016: 
£19.5m)). We are confident that the 
Group will continue to prosper and 
deliver high standards of service to 
our clients as well as value for our 
shareholders through our investment 
to support future growth.
