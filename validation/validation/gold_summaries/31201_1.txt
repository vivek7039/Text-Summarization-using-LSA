 As we announce our results for 2017, the 
Board has received and is recommending 
an offer from Advent International to 
buy the company. Laird is a high quality 
engineering business, with great products, 
people and technology, as the offer, and 
our 2017 results, both demonstrate. I will 
say more on the future of the Company 
in my outlook below.
At the start of 2017, I said that my 
focus on improving the efficiency 
and proﬁtability of our operations 
would be relentless. I am pleased that 
this forensic approach to operational 
improvement has brought much improved 
full year results. Laird has delivered a 
strong proﬁt uplift and entered 2018 
with encouraging momentum.
Our goal is to deliver long-term, 
sustainable revenue and earnings growth 
for our shareholders. This year we have 
made progress across all three divisions, 
as a result of the actions taken to 
improve performance. 
Our ambition is to be the partner of choice 
for our customers, who are redeﬁning 
the world through technology. We aim 
to harness our engineering expertise, our 
market insights and our reputation for 
delivery, to outperform our competitors. 
In doing so, we will deliver a powerful 
investor proposition. 
In 2017, we began putting the components  
in place to achieve this objective. In addition 
to the operational improvements, I have 
strengthened Laird’s executive team 
signiﬁcantly and embedded a new, 
simpliﬁed divisional structure. 
We will deliver our vision through a laser-
like focus on excellent customer service; 
through ﬂawless execution; and through 
continued investment in the world class 
engineering and materials science talent 
that is a key differentiator for Laird. 
In the short-term, we are much improved 
but far from perfect. There are further 
opportunities in front of us to improve our 
operational and commercial performance, 
and this will be a key theme for us in 2018.
Divisional highlights
2017 saw signiﬁcant beneﬁts from the 
simpliﬁed structure, which has brought 
efficiencies and enabled a greater 
focus on complementary markets 
and technologies.
In its ﬁrst year, the new Wireless and 
Thermal Systems (WTS) division 
performed well. The potential here is 
substantial, and we will continue to make 
the investments needed to secure future 
growth opportunities. 
WTS covers three broad technologies: 
connectivity, controls and active thermal 
management. We brought these together 
to better leverage the substantial array of 
engineering skills and technologies at our 
disposal. Connectivity and Thermal both 
delivered year-on-year revenue progress, 
with Connectivity being the stronger. 
The Controls product group was impacted 
in the previous year by the signiﬁcant 
external headwinds in one key market, the 
US rail freight sector. The market has not 
yet rebounded, although we do expect it 
to strengthen over time. In the meantime, 
there has been some encouraging early 
progress in our plan to diversify, both by 
product and geographies.

Chief Executive’s review
Our goal is to deliver long-term, 
sustainable revenue and earnings growth.
A stronger 
company with  
encouraging  
momentum Looking ahead, an area with some 
potential for WTS is Machine Condition 
Monitoring, a high-growth market 
addressing strong customer demand for 
solutions that contribute to productivity 
and efficiency, by monitoring performance 
of critical industrial equipment. Laird has 
a track record of excellence in wireless 
connectivity and deep expertise in 
mission-critical environments, which will 
be highly relevant. 
In Performance Materials (PM), we saw 
good revenue growth, albeit against a 
relatively weak comparative in the prior 
year. We have focused on improving 
the productivity of our manufacturing 
and operations, as well as improving our 
internal processes and correcting our 
commercial inefficiencies. 
The top line performance in 2017 
demonstrates that the actions taken to 
stabilise and improve our commercial 
and operational performance in PM have 
delivered results, with growth in all parts 
of the division, but particularly in Thermal 
Materials and Precision Metals. In Thermal 
Materials, the automotive market presents 
an attractive growth opportunity where we 
may have a real opportunity to generate 
value. The proliferation of electronics within 
the vehicle requires thermal and shielding 
solutions, where we very much excel. 
Medical and absorber markets in Europe 
and the US are also promising focus areas. 
In PM, we are working to establish a 
model that can deliver earnings growth, 
year-on-year, through the smartphone 
cycle. This requires targeted investment 
in non-smartphone business, to drive 
diversiﬁcation. We aim to leverage our 
unique materials science capability 
to develop differentiated solutions 
for our customers, a key to driving 
future proﬁtability. 
In Connected Vehicle Solutions (CVS), 
we are delivering strong revenue growth. 
In 2017 we exceeded $750m in future 
contract wins, which will fuel growth in 
future years. CVS has a full connectivity 
package to offer the major automotive 
manufacturers, and within that a strong 
suite of connectivity and smart device 
integration products. As a leading global 
provider of end-to-end automotive 
connectivity, we have continued to beneﬁt 
from the very strong relationships we have 
established in both the US and Europe. 
It is a market with very strong growth 
dynamics, but also highly competitive. 
It takes early investment to win contract 
opportunities, and that impacts 
margins. But we focus continually on 
sharpening our operations to maximise 
internal efficiencies. 
An important step for us this year was the 
establishment of our new research and 
design centre in Grand Blanc, Michigan, 
in the heart of America’s automotive 
industry. With state-of-the-art engineering 
and design facilities, testing laboratories 
for quality assurance, and other facilities, 
this new centre keeps Laird at the forefront 
of automotive connectivity R&D.
People
Laird’s people are our enduring 
advantage, and in the last 12 months, 
I have signiﬁcantly strengthened Laird’s 
leadership team. I want to thank the new 
executive team for driving our strong 
performance this year. Laird will only grow 
and prosper if we have the right people 
and invest in human capability across the 
company. Together we will write the next 
chapter in Laird’s story. 
Outlook
Laird made signiﬁcant progress and 
delivered a much improved performance 
this year, underpinned by our resolute 
focus on operational excellence. The steps 
taken have laid the ﬁrm foundations 
needed to build a platform for the future.
We have started 2018 with good 
underlying trading momentum across the 
majority of the business, with new business 
wins and new product launches expected 
to support future growth. We expect 
to demonstrate continued progress in 
underlying ﬁnancial performance this year, 
despite possible challenges in premium 
smartphone end markets.
However, as I write this we do have 
currency headwinds against our reported 
results, which are in Sterling. This should 
not distract from driving improvements in 
the sustainability of underlying proﬁt and 
quality of earnings, over the long term.
We aim to harness 
our engineering 
expertise, our 
market insights 
and our reputation 
for delivery, to 
outperform our 
competitors
The strong results secured by the 
actions taken over the past 12 months 
demonstrate the underlying strength of 
Laird. This strength has been recognised 
by Advent International who have offered 
a substantial premium to buy the Group. 
With almost 200 years of history, Laird 
has signiﬁcant prospects to grow and 
strengthen for many more years to come.
