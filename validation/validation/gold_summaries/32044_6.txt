The strategic review  
and target operating model
The Group began a Strategic Review 
in February 2017 . The objectives of the 
review fell into three broad categories:
 z Assessing our marketplace and 
customers’ buying preferences and 
criteria
 z Customer and market views of NCC 
Group and our capabilities, strengths 
and weaknesses
 z Assessing the commercial and 
portfolio logic of the current business 
lines within the Group
As findings began to emerge from the 
initial scope of work in the Strategic 
Review, we began a parallel work stream 
to consider: 
 z Assessing how we currently organise 
ourselves to address and capture 
the opportunities presented in 
our markets by best leveraging 
our strengths and unique selling 
propositions
Key findings from the 
Strategic Review
The key findings from the Strategic 
Review are set out in more detail in the 
later sections of this report but can be 
summarised as follows:
Marketplace: Our markets continue to 
grow strongly at or around a double-digit 
rate. Companies’ buying decisions are 
more about technical expertise and value 
for money than a simple price basis. See 
page 21 for more detail.
Our customers: NCC Group scores 
well on the issues that matter to 
customers: technical expertise, value for 
money and speed of delivery. The quality 
of customer service does appear to be 
an issue for the industry generally and 
NCC Group is similar in this regard. Our 
customers want to buy more from us 
and value our brand and reputation for 
excellence. See page 21 for more detail.
Our portfolio: The two divisions 
of Assurance and Escrow see little 
crossover in customer purchasing. 
However, Escrow is a robust stabilising 
influence on the Group. Within 
Assurance, we have identified two 
service lines that would have a better 
opportunity to flourish under alternative 
ownership and these will be sold in due 
course. See pages 8 and 29 for more 
detail.
As we digested the emerging outputs 
from the Strategic Review it became 
clear that to reach our full potential we 
would need to reorganise how we go 
to market and how we do business (in 
terms of our internal processes and 
structures). We have therefore started 
work on developing and implementing a 
new Target Operating Model (TOM), as 
further described on page 19.

The market 
opportunity
Introduction
Fundamentally, NCC Group is operating 
in a dynamic and fast growing market. 
Or rather, a series of related but 
separate fast growing markets. These 
statements apply whether one considers 
the marketplace from a product and 
service perspective, from a geographical 
perspective, or from an industry vertical 
perspective. Change is literally the one 
constant in almost all aspects of the 
market.
Today, cyber crime is one of the 
single biggest threats to businesses 
and individuals around the world. 
The average cost to recover from a 
DDoS attack is £275,000 and more 
than 90 per cent of businesses have 
experienced some form of cyber security 
threat. On average, it takes almost 
120 days for an organisation to find out 
that it has been compromised.
Furthermore, from our own research 
into the safety of the Internet, almost 
two-thirds of consumers believe an 
online data breach will compromise their 
financial information within the next 
year. The fact that some 60 per cent of 
consumers are more worried than ever 
before about protecting their personal 
and financial information online should 
certainly confirm the threat as one of the 
greatest to face businesses today.
Online security still seems to be behind 
the curve in failing to keep pace with 
the numerous types of organisations 
and individuals that seek to disrupt 
the Internet and organisations’ use of 
systems and data. The threat of being 
hacked or having valuable data stolen 
continues to evolve rapidly and at a 
seemingly unstoppable pace. Attacks 
using phishing, fake payment requests 
and ransomware are now everyday 
events. These attacks often cause 
significant operational disruption whose 
economic consequences can vastly 
outweigh any cost of remediation or 
prevention. Our challenge is to ensure 
that customers understand that a 
relatively modest up front investment 
in advice or other cyber services can 
ultimately save significant sums in 
remediation costs or arising from 
reputational damage.
The world in which we live cannot be 
made completely safe from cybercrime. 
As the number and range of threats 
proliferate, being innovative and using 
our experience and skills to protect 
against attacks becomes more important 
than ever. NCC Group is doing this by 
providing the best security consultants 
to world leading clients as well as 
conducting world-renowned security 
research.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Market dynamics
The relevant sub-segments that NCC Group’s core cyber offering competes in are shown below:
NCC AR2017 - proof 8-Front.indd   20 09/08/2017   16:04:20 25546.04    9 August 2017 3:58 PM    Proof Six
The addressable market is clearly very large at $38 bn 
in total and very fragmented. Management estimate that 
NCC Group is one of the largest “pure play” cyber security 
companies focusing on services as opposed to products 
but yet has relatively low market shares in most segments 
and geographies. Once we have developed robust and 
scalable internal structures and processes, this will 
represent a significant opportunity to grow the business 
profitably though bolt-on acquisitions.
Market research as part of the Strategic Review also 
confirmed that market growth is likely to continue and that 
customers’ propensity to pay more for high quality advice 
and solutions is growing.
Customers buying behaviours and key 
purchasing criteria (KPCs)
Customers made clear that their key buying criteria focus more 
on quality of technical expertise and advice as opposed to 
price. While value for money (effectively a ratio or a comparison 
of quality and cost) is very important, that reflects more on the 
demand for quality than low cost.
This is highlighted in the chart below that shows the relative 
importance of customers’ Key Purchasing Criteria (i.e the 
factors that influence their buying decisions). 
Interestingly, customers did not place as high a value on the 
ability to source internationally. Even in those customers who 
did buy in multiple territories.
In summary, on the items that matter most to customers in 
their buying decisions, NCC Group scores well or very well 
with the exception of customer service, which appears to be an 
industry-wide issue.
Technical 
Expertise
Consistently noted as having top-tier 
technical talent, Fox-IT seen as most 
technically advanced player in NL.
UK and US customers often feel 
NCC Group too transactional. Fox-
IT customers value their trusted 
partnership.
NCC Group and Fox-IT generally 
perceived as good value. Customers 
very willing to pay more for quality.
Seen as “mid-sized”, competing with 
boutique pure-plays, NCC Group 
advantages include wider capabilities 
and flexibility.
Well known by security professionals  
in the UK and US. Fox-IT highly regarded 
in NL (Dutch government work).
Seen to be expensive but price rarely 
the deciding factor. NCC Group rated 
highly as good “value for money”.

The market 
opportunity
Our competitive position
We must continue to drive innovation and thought leadership 
in our key market segments. The key is to ensure that our 
thought leadership also leads to practical new solutions to 
apply to the challenges and issues that our customers face. We 
must find the right balance of “blue sky” thinking and ideas that 
can be rapidly commercialised.
Innovation and creativity are two key foundations for the 
Group’s continued development and growth. Our new Target 
Operating Model is designed to ensure that these remain a 
core feature of the business. The recent and well publicised 
cyber attacks on a wide range of public and private enterprises 
around the world are a reminder of the need to constantly 
innovate.
The graphic below shows the current range and scale of the 
services and products offered by NCC Group in the cyber 
security market. Our aim is to shift more of our business to the 
right and upwards; that is, more repeat business of a highly 
differentiated nature.
During the Strategic Review we assessed the Group’s “Net 
Promotor Score” (NPS). This metric is widely used across a 
range of industries where customer satisfaction is a critical 
performance indicator. What NPS measures, quite simply, is 
whether or not a customer, on the basis of its experiences with 
a service provider, would recommend that service provider to 
another organisation. The measurement scale in NPS is itself 
a challenge – a positive score is counted if it rates a nine or 
ten out of ten. Conversely, a negative score is recorded for any 
outcome ranging from zero to six. What this means is that if a 
company received 100 scores of its service, with 10 ratings in 
each category, its NPS score would be negative 40.
The results of the NPS survey found NCC Group with a score 
of “positive 26”. As noted above in the explanation of the 
methodology, achieving any sort of positive score is difficult 
and a positive score of 26 means the significant majority of 
ratings by customers had to be above six out of ten and with a 
high proportion of those scoring the top two marks.
What the survey did show was that NCC Group scored better 
than many of its direct competitors in the Big Four or in the 
pure play cyber services companies. The business only rated 
less strongly compared to large Systems Integrators, defence 
contractors or product-based cyber companies. It is clear, when 
combined with direct interview feedback from customers, that 
NCC Group is well regarded for our technical expertise and 
its ability to help its customers overcome their cyber security 
challenges.

Target Operating Model 
(TOM)
Our current organisational structures 
and operating model have reached 
the limits of their design tolerances. In 
many cases the overlay of our business 
processes on those organisational 
design features creates a “spaghetti 
wiring diagram” that is complex, 
delivers unclear accountabilities and 
is undoubtedly inefficient at delivering 
business processes and services to 
customers. The recent addition of 
some relatively large acquisitions has 
emphasised further the need for a clear 
and transparent operating model that 
delivers a number of key objectives, the 
principal ones being as set out below.
TOM OBJECTIVE 1: Align the 
business to how our customers want 
to buy
The Strategic Review revealed that even 
our global customers tend to want to 
buy local services for delivery in country. 
This is true even for customers who have 
a central technology input to sourcing 
decisions. This finding drives the 
conclusion of a TOM that has a primary 
dimension of geographical business 
units and P&L accountability.
TOM OBJECTIVE 2: Leverage NCC 
Group value between business units
The business has historically operated 
within silos. This has been the case even 
inside individual business units where 
our structures have not encouraged 
service or product line leaders to cross 
sell or provide fully integrated solutions 
to our customers. Our historical Go-
To-Market model was identified by 
customers as being too transactional in 
many cases. While initiatives to address 
this issue began during the year, the old 
operating model barriers to collaboration 
were not removed. 
Our customers value our technical 
expertise and the wide range of services 
that we offer. Therefore, in order to 
leverage value across the geographies 
and service lines, we concluded that a 
matrix structure would be appropriate 
for the TOM. Therefore, the secondary 
dimension of the TOM is based around 
key service and product lines with key 
leadership and accountability roles 
identified within each to ensure sharing 
of best practice. To avoid unnecessary 
cost increases or duplication of roles, 
there will be some “double-hatting” in 
smaller businesses as they grow.
TOM OBJECTIVE 3: Deliver an 
integrated Go-To-Market proposition
Our customers value our expertise 
and range of services. They would like 
to buy more from us. But our current 
Go-To-Market approach can make 
this difficult. The challenges flow from 
disparate accountabilities and targets 
for different teams within the business 
units. We are therefore creating aligned 
sales and delivery teams with single 
leaders within each geography. Critically, 
sales leadership for strategic accounts, 
transactional sales activities, inside 
sales, bid preparation and management, 
and supporting marketing activities will 
report to one person in each territory. 
This will allow us to join up our offerings 
at a more strategic purchasing level 
within customers while also ensuring 
that our current successful transactional 
sales generation machine continues to 
perform.
TOM OBJECTIVE 4: Create 
scalable structures that facilitate 
profitable growth
Our historical ways of working and focus 
on certain services and products prevent 
benefits of scale from being realised. 
Selling more of a particular service 
would lead to an equal and proportionate 
increase in our costs and hence no 
positive operational leverage to drive 
improving margins.
Our staff management and work 
allocation processes have been less 
efficient than we would like. This has led 
to under-selling of key technical skills 
in that they are used on activities that 
attract a lower day rate than they should. 
As well as more accurate matching of 
our staff skills to the value of the work 
being performed for customers, we also 
intend to increase our focus on platform-
based sales such as monitoring services 
and after sales value added services. In 
particular, these will be driven from our 
Security Operations Centres in Delft 
(Fox) and Leeds (MSS) and will include 
services such as Threat Intelligence, 
DetACT, Managed Security Services, and 
our CTMp platform.
TOM OBJECTIVE 5: Design and 
implement effective and efficient 
business processes that support 
operating leverage
Over the last few years our support costs 
have been rising steadily, creating a 
further erosion of operating leverage or 
in some cases even leading to negative 
operating leverage. This reflects the 
fact that in many cases our business 
processes and systems have not been 
upgraded to keep pace with the size 
and complexity of the Group. The Group 
has been slow in rolling out its preferred 
core systems and this has caused undue 
delays, cost increases and inefficiency in 
how we work. These issues extend from 
finance and reporting systems to CRM 
systems to work and staff planning and 
management processes and beyond.
A key part of implementing the TOM 
is to embed effective and efficient 
business processes and systems within 
it. Over the next two years we will 
therefore be focusing on designing and 
implementing standardised business 
processes and making sure that they, 
and the underpinning systems, are rolled 
out across all of our business units. 
These systems and processes will often 
be designed and monitored centrally to 
ensure shared disciplines and effective 
control of the business.
Underpinning all of the objectives for 
the TOM will be a series of direct and 
specific key performance indicators 
and other metrics that drive the desired 
behaviours and outcomes. For example, 
we will be focusing on realisation for 
our consultants’ time as opposed to 
the more simple but less informative 
utilisation measure. Realisation will focus 
on a combination of hours worked but 
also, critically, on the amount of work 
that is actually billed and the rate at 
which it is billed. These are currently 
areas where we believe there is value 
leakage from the Group and plugging 
these leaks will help to generate 
improved margins in future.
