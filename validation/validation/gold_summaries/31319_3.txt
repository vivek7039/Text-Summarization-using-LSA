Chairman’s Statement
A very strong 
year at 
Huntsworth
I am pleased to report a very strong 
year at Huntsworth. We have made 
significant progress in executing our 
strategy of transforming the Group into 
a Healthcare marketing services-
focused business, helped by the 
acquisition of The Creative Engagement 
Group (‘TCEG’). 
Our continued focus on operational 
efficiencies and the elimination of 
loss-making agencies combined with 
strong organic growth from the 
Healthcare division produced a very 
strong like-for-like growth in headline 
profit of 20%.
We continued to refine and execute the 
Group’s strategy during 2017. The 
restructuring of the Group into four 
principal divisions following the 
acquisition of TCEG gives a better 
balance to our reporting structure and 
provides greater insight into the 
performance of the Group.
Buoyant trading in the three Healthcare-
focused divisions was again led by 
Evoke (within the Marketing division) 
and ApotheCom (in the Medical 
division), both of which had outstanding 
years. I was delighted to welcome TCEG 
into the Group in July, an excellent team 
with a passion for their work. They bring 
new capabilities in mixed media and 
exhibitions to the Group, as well as 
access to new types of clients. TCEG has 
performed well in its first six months, it 
is now fully integrated within the Group 
and is increasingly engaged in joint new 
business with other Group agencies.
We have made significant 
progress in executing our 
strategy of transforming the 
Group into a Healthcare 
marketing services focused 
business.

In our Communications division, I am 
pleased to report that Grayling has 
responded positively to its restructuring 
and has now returned to profitability, 
with a notably strong performance from 
its UK operation. Red has had a good 
year despite some client attrition, but 
recent wins emphasise its fundamental 
strength. Citigate Dewe Rogerson has 
had a solid year despite difficult market 
conditions in the UK and Asia.
There is real momentum at Huntsworth 
as all the agencies focus on what is of 
most value to their clients. There is a 
very different sense of what is possible 
than there was just over three years ago 
when I joined the Group. So it is with 
much sadness that, given my other 
commitments, I will step down as Chair, 
subject to an orderly succession 
process.
After three years’ service, Tim Ryan, the 
Group’s Senior Independent Director, 
stepped down from the Board in 
December 2017. I would like to thank Tim 
for his support and help in guiding the 
Group over the critical restructuring 
period from 2014 to 2017. Andy Boland, 
who is the Group’s longest serving 
Non-Executive Director, will become the 
new Senior Independent Director. We 
also welcomed Liz McKee Anderson to 
the Board on 1 January 2018. Liz brings a 
wealth of experience in healthcare and 
will be a valuable asset for the Group as 
it expands its Healthcare focus in the 
coming years.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank the management team and staff 
for their hard work in achieving the 
growth we have enjoyed this year and 
look forward to more of the same during 
2018.
These impressive results are an 
encouraging indicator of the progress 
made over the past three years. We 
enter 2018 with good trading 
momentum and confidence for the year 
ahead.
