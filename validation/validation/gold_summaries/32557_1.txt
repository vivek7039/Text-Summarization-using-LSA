 Chief 
Executive’s 
Letter
The world is changing faster than ever before, 
shaping the way our customers live their lives. 
Growth of shopping via digital channels and 
customer expectations of speed and convenience 
are changing the retail industry. To meet these 
challenges, we will continue to adapt and evolve 
our business to meet new shopping habits and 
provide customers with great products and 
services at fair prices whenever and wherever 
they want to shop with us.
10 Strategic Report This has been a pivotal year for Sainsbury’s. 
The strategy we set out in November 
2014 was designed to address a changing 
marketplace and the investments we 
have made in our core Food business 
differentiated us through our combination 
of quality, choice and value. We will continue 
to enhance our food proposition further and 
to grow our General Merchandise, Clothing 
and Financial Services businesses. We 
welcomed 30,000 colleagues to our business 
in September when we acquired Home Retail 
Group plc – owner of Argos and Habitat. 
The acquisition will accelerate our strategy 
and gives us a strong platform to deliver 
synergies and future growth. 
The retail market remains very competitive. 
Underlying profit before tax for the Group 
is £581 million, down one per cent, and Group 
sales are £29,112 million, up 12.7 per cent on 
last year. These numbers reflect the positive 
contribution made by Argos to the Group. 
Sainsbury’s market share dropped by 23 basis 
points to 16.3 per cent and, while like-for-like 
sales are down 0.6 per cent, this is an 
improvement on last year, demonstrating 
the resilience of our Food business in a 
competitive market. Profits at Sainsbury’s 
continue to be impacted by ongoing price 
investment and cost price pressures.
Our balance sheet is robust and we are 
managing costs carefully. We are on track to 
achieve our current cost saving target of £500 
million by 2017/18 and we have committed 
to a further three-year cost saving target 
of £500 million from 2018/19. Net debt has 
reduced by £349 million this year. Consistent 
with our affordable dividend policy, this year’s 
final dividend is 6.6 pence per share, bringing 
the full-year dividend to 10.2 pence per share.
A pivotal year
Our goal is to make our customers’ lives 
easier every day by offering great quality 
products and services at fair prices. Food 
is at the heart of what we do and we have 
completed our programme to improve the 
quality of 3,000 food lines that matter most 
to our customers. We are now reviewing 125 
food categories, touching around 60 per cent 
of our food range, to further develop our food 
quality and value.
When we acquired Argos and Habitat in 
September, we became one of the UK’s 
leading food, general merchandise, clothing 
and financial services retailers – a multi-
product, multi-channel business that offers 
our customers more choice and gives us the 
capability to serve them with even greater 
speed and convenience. 
Sainsbury’s Bank is a great asset to the Group 
and played a key part in the acquisition 
by enabling us to finance the deal in a 
very cost efficient way. Sainsbury’s Bank 
reached a major milestone this year when we 
successfully transferred savings customers 
and our ATM estate on to our newly built, 
wholly-owned banking platform. We 
continue to make good progress and will 
introduce our new loans platform by the end 
of 2017. This gives Sainsbury’s Bank a solid 
base from which to grow. We also offer an 
enhanced range of products and services, 
such as a choice of home and car insurance 
options with our new panel of insurers 
and our new mortgage proposition which 
launched in April 2017.
This has been a pivotal year 
for Sainsbury’s. The strategy 
we set out in November 2014 
was designed to address 
a changing marketplace 
and the investments we 
have made in our core 
Food business mean we 
are clearly differentiated 
by our combination of 
quality, choice and value.”

Our Business Strategy
 11 Strategic Report The new Sainsbury’s Group 
We are building a business for now and 
the future. We go forward as a combined 
Sainsbury’s Group, strengthened by the 
addition of Argos, Habitat and Sainsbury’s 
Bank. We benefit from the trust customers 
have in our brands and from the ability to 
offer our customers great value and choice 
across multiple product categories and 
channels. We are well placed to increase 
customer loyalty across food, general 
merchandise, clothing and financial services, 
driving sales, profit and maximising the 
opportunities for growth to create value 
for all our stakeholders.
To focus on our four key priorities we have 
closed Netto, Sainsbury’s Entertainment and 
our Phone Shops.
Four key priorities for growth
Our strategy remains based on five pillars 
(see page 11). Within this we have prioritised 
four key areas of our business where we can 
differentiate ourselves, grow and create value: 
1 Further enhance our  
differentiated food offer
We continue to invest in our core Food 
business and to focus on the quality of 
Sainsbury’s branded food products. We have 
removed multi-buy promotions across our 
food ranges in favour of lower regular prices 
and we invest in our prices to ensure we offer 
customers value for money. We will always 
be competitive on price.
Sainsbury’s has a strong heritage of 
innovation in key products and categories. 
For example, we were the first retailer of 
organic produce in the UK. We continue to 
innovate, targeting growing food categories 
where we can increase our market share, 
such as Food to Go and Free From, where we 
can build on the trust customers have in the 
Sainsbury’s brand to develop and strengthen 
our offer and become a market leader. 
We regularly review the layouts of our stores 
so that customers can do their shopping 
with us quickly and more conveniently. We 
are investing in our Groceries Online service, 
improving the customer experience on our 
website and expanding our Click & Collect 
service. Demonstrating the speed of change 
within retail, the Groceries Online shopping 
app we launched in May 2016 now accounts 
for over ten per cent of online food orders.
2 Grow General Merchandise & 
Clothing and deliver synergies
Sainsbury’s General Merchandise business 
is well-established and growing. We are 
focused on developing complementary, 
clearly defined general merchandise ranges 
across Sainsbury’s, Argos and Habitat, 
offering our customers the best choice and 
quality at fair prices.
Our Tu clothing business provides high street 
style at supermarket prices and eight million 
customers buy our clothing. Our market 
share by volume increased by 20 basis points 
and we are the sixth largest clothing retailer 
by volume in the UK, with a strong position 
in womenswear and childrenswear and 
opportunities for future growth in menswear. 
We are integrating Argos in to our business 
at pace. The 59 Argos Digital stores located 
in Sainsbury’s supermarkets are performing 
well and sales in stores open for more than a 
year are delivering like-for-like sales increases 
of between 20 and 30 per cent. Reflecting 
the strong performance of the Argos Digital 
stores, we are accelerating our plans to open 
the planned 250 Argos Digital stores six 
months ahead of schedule. 
Our 207 digital collection points offer 
customers a fast, convenient delivery 
service across eBay, DPD, Tu clothing and, 
in 90 stores customers can also collect Argos 
deliveries. This gives customers the flexibility 
to pick-up their parcels when it is convenient 
to them and drives footfall in to our 
supermarkets. 
18 per cent of Group sales at peak times now 
originate online and our strength in digital, 
combined with Argos’s leading delivery 
services, including Fast Track, will enable us 
to grow both now and in the future and give 
us a crucial competitive advantage.
3 Diversify and grow Sainsbury’s Bank
Sainsbury’s Bank continues to grow and 
generates strong customer loyalty. We know 
that people who buy our financial services 
products shop with us more frequently and 
spend more money than those who do not, 
giving us a strong platform for growth. We 
have integrated Argos Financial Services in 
to Sainsbury’s Bank. There is opportunity for 
this to give us a significant boost in customer 
base and operations and we are injecting 
additional capital in areas of Sainsbury’s 
Bank which will generate good returns. 
Sainsbury’s Bank is well set to deliver strong 
profit growth.
The market remains very 
competitive and the impact 
of cost price pressures 
remains uncertain. However, 
we are well placed to 
navigate the external 
environment and remain 
focused on delivering our 
strategy.”  
Mike Coupe Chief Executive Officer, 
J Sainsbury plc
12 Strategic Report 4 Continue cost savings and maintain 
balance sheet strength
In line with other UK retailers, we anticipate 
that cost pressures will continue over the 
next few years. The price of raw materials 
and energy is increasing, along with wages 
and business rates. Across our business we 
are focused on finding ways to mitigate the 
impact of these rising costs so that we can 
continue to deliver for customers, colleagues 
and shareholders. 
We remain focused on cost reduction and 
efficiency. By the end of 2017/18 we will 
have delivered £500 million of cost savings 
in three years across our business and we 
are committed to a further £500 million 
reduction over the next three years, starting 
in 2018/19. 
This focus will allow us to continue to invest 
in our business and our colleagues, as well as 
provide our shareholders with a return on the 
investment they have made in Sainsbury’s.
Our values
As a major retailer, in a highly competitive 
industry, our values differentiate us from 
our competitors, make strong commercial 
sense and enable us to play a leading role in 
tackling some of the challenges facing our 
customers every day. Our values enable us 
to be more efficient in our own operations, 
for example, by using less electricity in our 
stores and also by protecting security of 
supply in our supply chain. Through our 
living healthier lives commitments we are 
also making it easier for our customers to 
make healthier choices through product 
reformulation and innovation. We are also 
helping customers to save money and 
reduce household food waste through our 
five-year Waste less, Save more initiative. 
This is now being rolled out to more than 
140 communities across the UK. As well as 
building trust among our customers, we 
know our values help to make Sainsbury’s 
a great place to work.
We are optimistic about  
the future
Our success relies on knowing our customers 
better than anyone else. We must offer them 
what they want now and anticipate what 
they will want in the future, across food, 
general merchandise, clothing and financial 
services. As we grow we will become a bigger 
part of our customers’ lives and find more 
ways to save them time and money, offering 
them the same great quality at fair prices that 
has been the core of what we do since 1869.
I would like to thank the 195,000 colleagues 
from across the Group for the market-leading 
service they deliver and the difference they 
make to our customers every day. Together 
with the values that underpin our business, 
they differentiate us from our competitors 
and I am pleased that colleagues across 
the Group will share in this year’s bonus of 
£78 million.
The market remains very competitive and 
the impact of cost price pressures remains 
uncertain. However, we are well placed to 
navigate the external environment and 
remain focused on delivering our strategy.
