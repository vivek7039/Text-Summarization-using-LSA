 This has been another year of 
considerable progress at Xeros.
We also commenced implementation of our plan to move our 
Hotel & Lodging business to a low-cost model with the launch 
of the Symphony Project in April 2017. Symphony Project 
enables OEMs to integrate Xeros’ technology into their own-
branded products and to use their existing channels for its 
commercialisation. Subject to successful validation and testing 
we are targeting OEMs to begin this commercialisation in 2019. 
At the end of the year, we had a total of 381 commissioned 
machines earning revenue, a growth of 80% during the year. 
Our learning and US market presence has been instrumental 
in creating demand for Xeros’ benefits in multiple new 
geographies and has provided credibility for all the applications 
we are now looking to commercialise.
Following the contract signature with Wollsdorf Leder, 
our Tanning Technologies team have successfully delivered 
many scale trials with leading European tanneries. With 
the technology itself now proven, focus has been on 
completing the engineering solutions which customers 
need to incorporate the technology into their process. Our 
plan is to sign a number of multi-year contracts in 2018.
The development of Textile Technologies, which we started in 
mid-2016, is now delivering comparable water and chemistry 
savings to those achieved by our other applications. Following 
further scale trials, we are planning to engage with major 
garment manufacturers and targeting to sign development 
agreements by the end of the year.
We have a clear commercialisation strategy predicated on 
generating returns on our intellectual property. We only 
physically enter markets where it is imperative for us to prove 
out and de-risk our applications, ahead of licensing or selling 
our technology to others who are best placed to maximise 
their commercial potential. 
Our strategy is dependent upon a robust intellectual property 
portfolio which at the end of March 2018 totalled 48 “pending” 
and “granted” patent families which represents an increase 
of 7 since the beginning of 2017.
In December, we raised £25m before fees to accelerate the 
commercialisation of our application portfolio and to achieve 
specific commercial milestones in each of our businesses, 
thereby giving a clear line of sight to monetisation of our 
intellectual property portfolio.
The Board and I view the Group as now being close to a 
number of major inflection points, each of which has the 
capacity to generate significant value for our investors, many 
of whom have been supportive since the inception of the 
Group in 2006. Their loyalty, combined with the continued 
commitment and dedication of our employees, has taken us 
to this point. I look forward to 2018 being a pivotal year in the 
development of the Group.

Having now materially completed the development for the
majority of our chosen applications, the Group is focused on
their commercialisation under IP-rich, capital-light business
models. 
After many years of groundbreaking innovation, we are now in 
the position of being able to engage meaningfully with major 
industry players around the world, who are best placed to 
market and sell our technologies into the global markets they 
serve.
Our applications are targeted at global scale industries, the 
long-term viability of which are being threatened by increasing 
water constraints and pollution challenges. Xeros’ technologies 
materially improve sustainability whilst simultaneously delivering 
performance and economic benefits. In this respect, Xeros 
represents a unique solution to a world already suffering from 
high water stress, which will only increase with population 
growth and continued urbanisation. 
During the year, we continued to demonstrate and prove 
the benefits of Xeros technology in our Cleaning and Tanning 
Technology businesses. We also established that we have the 
potential to create significant value with our Textile applications.
In Cleaning Technologies, we established a new business 
unit, High Performance Workwear, which made a number 
of acquisitions in the fifteen months to April 2018 to build a 
platform from which to serve firefighters across the US. The 
application of Xeros’ technology significantly reduces harmful 
contamination in firefighters’ expensive Personal Protective 
Equipment (“PPE”) whilst simultaneously extending its life. 
The learning and knowledge from owning these businesses 
will create a platform that we believe will create a valuable 
proprietary asset that can be leveraged to bring our technology 
to PPE markets on a global basis.
In the domestic market, we launched our new low cost 
domestic washing machine design, the XDrum
TM
, to wide 
acclaim at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 
January 2018. We also unveiled our proprietary microparticle 
filtration solution, the XFiltra
TM
, which radically reduces the 
micro-plastic pollution produced by the washing of synthetic 
garments. Our objective in doing so was to start meaningful 
discussions with major OEMs, which are now underway.
