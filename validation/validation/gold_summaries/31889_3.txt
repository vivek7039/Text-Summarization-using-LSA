 Sareum made important progress during the year ended 
30 June 2017 across its key development programmes. 
The highlight of the year was the signing of a licence agreement 
for the Chk1 programme with Sierra Oncology, Inc (NASDAQ: 
SRRA). This agreement has brought a highly committed and 
well-funded partner, with proven experience in oncology drug 
development, to realise the value of this exciting programme. 
Already, the impact of Sierra Oncology’s commitment is being 
seen with the implementation of highly innovative clinical trial 
designs. Additionally, clinical opportunities to explore the 
potential of SRA737 with other new classes of targeted cancer 
therapy are expected in 2018.
The agreement with Sierra Oncology represents a significant 
validation of Sareum’s business model, which is based on its 
expertise in small molecule drug design and its strategy to 
develop programmes to late preclinical or early clinical stages. 
Sareum aims to take advantage of the substantial values 
associated with out-licensing programmes at these stages.
The transfer of development costs to Sierra Oncology, alongside 
income from the Chk1 agreement, is enabling Sareum to allocate 
more resources to its other programmes. In particular, the TYK2 
programme has made encouraging progress during the period 
and candidate selection studies for both autoimmune and cancer 
indications are expected to commence in the first half of 2018, 
while the Aurora+FL T3 programme is advancing through preclinical 
development despite some delays.
Financial review
From a financial perspective, continued efficient capital use 
and the receipt of licensing income has resulted in the Company 
achieving a maiden profit of £400k on ordinary activities (after 
taxation) for the year ended 30 June 201 7 (2016: loss of £1.05 million).
The Company ended the year with net assets of £2.34 million 
(2016: £1.86 million), of which £2.31 million comprised cash at 
bank (2016: £1.25 million). The Company received £1.50 million 
from Sierra Oncology as its share of the US$7 million upfront 
payment from the out-licensing agreement for SRA737 and a 
milestone payment of £450k received (share of US$2 million 
payment) following the successful transfer of the two ongoing 
Phase 1 clinical trials of SRA737. 
Chairman’s Statement
Sareum also received £229k in unspent funds previously invested 
in the co-investment partnership with the CRT Pioneer Fund for the 
clinical development of the Chk1 programme during the second 
half of the period. 
Outlook
Overall, the Directors are delighted with the progress 
made across the Company’s programmes during the period. 
Sareum’s business model and its expertise in the design and 
early development of novel drug candidates that offer attractive 
commercialisation opportunities has been strongly validated 
by the licence agreement with Sierra Oncology. 
From a financial perspective, this progress has culminated in 
a maiden profit for the Company. 
More importantly, however, Sareum has gained an experienced, 
highly committed and well-funded development partner for SRA737 
in Sierra Oncology. The next update from the innovative clinical 
development programme with SRA737 that Sierra Oncology is 
driving is expected in February 2018.
The income received to date and the future milestone payments 
possible (pending their achievement) from this programme are 
providing Sareum with increased resources to accelerate its internal 
activities. This includes the selection of clinical candidates in its 
TYK2 programmes in both autoimmune diseases and cancer 
indications, expected in 2018, and further preclinical progress 
anticipated in the Aurora+FLT3 programme. 
The Company continues to engage with potential partners 
with a view to securing commercial licences for its products and 
programmes, while exploring new research programmes from its 
in-house drug discovery platform, as well as external early stage 
opportunities that can be potentially in-licensed and progressed 
into the clinic.
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued 
support and look forward to providing further updates on progress 
in 2018.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4 Important clinical progress with 
SRA737, a novel Chk1 kinase inhibitor
SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, orally 
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of 
important cell cycle checkpoints and central mediator of the 
DNA Damage Response (DDR) network.
Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737 in two 
innovative Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with 
advanced cancer and tumours identified to have 
genetic aberrations (mutations) that are thought 
to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. Sierra 
Oncology amended protocols for both trials to 
take advantage of this fundamental role of Chk1 
in cancer, with the objective of enhancing patient 
selection and maximising potential responses. 
The first trial is intended to evaluate SRA737 
as a monotherapy in patients whose cancer 
has the defined genetic profile described above. 
In June 2017, Sierra Oncology reported that the 
dose escalation phase of the monotherapy trial 
had advanced successfully and that the cohort 
expansion phase, now running at eight UK hospitals, 
is enrolling patients with five cancer types that are 
predicted to be highly sensitive to Chk1 inhibition: 
colorectal, head and neck, non-small-cell lung, 
ovarian and prostate.
The trial aims to identify a dose for Phase 2 studies 
along with preliminary efficacy to determine 
potential patient selection strategies for further 
clinical development.
The combination study is exploring 
the potentiating effects of low-dose 
gemcitabine (a chemotherapy that 
causes replication stress and DNA 
damage) in combination with 
SRA737, also in patients with 
genetically profiled cancers.
The study aims to establish the 
safety profile and identify a dose for 
further development of SRA737 in 
combination with low-dose gemcitabine. 
Once determined, the study will evaluate the 
preliminary efficacy of the SRA737/gemcitabine 
combination in genetically defined subjects with 
bladder or pancreatic cancer.
Sierra Oncology intends to provide an update 
on the SRA737 programme in late February 2018 
and expects to present data at a medical conference 
in H2 2018.
In addition, Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737 , 
with potential clinical opportunities in 2018, in 
combination with targeted cancer therapeutics 
where there is a strong biological rationale for 
synergy with Chk1 inhibition. These include 
anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 therapies and other 
DDR inhibitors such as PARP inhibitors.

Spotlight on SRA737
SRA737 was discovered as the result of a research collaboration between 
Sareum, the Institute of Cancer Research and Cancer Research 
Technology (CRT). Preclinical and initial clinical development was 
carried out in a co-investment collaboration between Sareum and the 
CRT Pioneer Fund. The programme was licensed for further clinical 
development and commercialisation to Nasdaq-listed Sierra Oncology 
in September 2016 in a deal worth a potential US$328.5 million plus 
royalties, of which Sareum is eligible to receive 27 .5% of the economics.
