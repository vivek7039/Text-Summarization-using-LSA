Chief Executive’s Statement
Our evolving 
business model 
and strategy
Introduction
Huntsworth made strong progress in 
2017 with all operating divisions growing 
profit. Revenue grew by 9% to £197.0 
million and headline profit before tax by 
52% to £24.4 million. On a like-for-like 
basis, this represents growth of 4% and 
20% respectively.
As part of the strategic development of 
the Group and its increased focus on 
Healthcare we took the decision to 
streamline how we organise ourselves, 
providing shareholders with a better 
understanding of the Group and offering 
clients easier access to multiple services 
when required. The Group now has two 
distinct areas of focus: Healthcare, 
which is made up of three divisions, 
Medical, Marketing, and Immersive; and 
Communications, which constitutes one 
division and contains the agencies 
Grayling, Red and Citigate Dewe 
Rogerson. 
Healthcare remains the primary focus of 
Huntsworth. Fast-moving innovation in 
healthcare treatments, along with growing 
global demand for new drugs to help 
ageing populations, are driving a complex 
market place that requires a combination 
of higher margin consultancy services and 
more effective marketing.
Following a decision to 
streamline how we organise 
ourselves, the Group now 
has two distinct areas of 
focus; Healthcare and 
Communications.

Headline profit before tax
We see increasing opportunities arising 
from healthcare-focused clients seeking 
a more differentiated and increasingly 
digital offering for their medical and 
marketing communications. To further 
support this we acquired The Creative 
Engagement Group (‘TCEG’) in July 
2017 for £25.0 million, settled in cash. 
TCEG consists of three agencies that 
provide experiential marketing, primarily 
to healthcare clients. Its integration will 
further strengthen our digital capability 
while allowing TCEG to benefit from 
access to the Group’s global resources. 
While Huntsworth is firmly focused on 
developing and adding to its Healthcare 
assets, Communications remains an 
important part of the Group, contributing 
21% of profits before central costs. 2017 
has seen further good progress in 
reorganising and right-sizing elements of 
the offering, leaving the division in a 
better position to compete and increase 
profitability in the coming years.
Group performance overview
The Group’s performance this year 
primarily reflects a combination of 
strong growth from the three Healthcare 
divisions, the impact of a favourable 
move in exchange rates and Grayling’s 
return to profitability. The bridge below 
shows the key movements in headline 
profits in 2017.
 
A weaker sterling in 2017 compared to 
2016 has generated a translational gain 
of £1.1 million, with a further £2.0 million 
incremental gain on hedging 
instruments. The acquisition of TCEG 
added £1.5 million to profits, net of 
interest. Reduced losses on operations 
disposed of in either 2016 or 2017 added 
a further £0.1 million to profits. After 
adjusting for these factors, like-for-like 
profits were up 20% reflecting strong 
organic growth.
Revenues were £197.0 million in 2017 
(2016: £180.1 million), with favourable 
currency movements contributing £7.1 
million. On a like-for-like basis, revenues 
£’m 2017 2016
Operating profit 24.9 (14.5)
Goodwill impairment – 30.5
Restructuring costs – 2.0
Amortisation 1.4 0.9
Other highlighted items 0.1 (0.9)
Operating profit before highlighted items 26.4 18.0
Margin 13.4% 10.0%
Interest (2.0) (2.0)
Headline profit before tax 24.4 16.0
grew by 4%, reflecting strong organic 
growth from the Healthcare divisions, 
offset by decreases in revenues from the 
Communications division as we 
eliminated loss making agencies and 
clients.
Headline profit before tax was £24.4 
million (2016: 16.0 million), an increase  
of 52% or 20% on a like-for-like basis. 
Operating profits were £24.9 million 
(2016: loss of £14.5 million), with much  
of the improvement attributable to a 
lower goodwill impairment charge. The 
table below reconciles statutory to 
headline profits.
The Group’s effective tax rate has 
increased to 21% (2016: 18%) principally 
as a result of the increase in profits. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share 
were 5.8p (2016: 4.0p), an increase of 
45%. Looking forward we expect the 
recently announced tax reforms in the 
US to have a moderately positive effect 
on the Group’s tax rate. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Divisional
performance
overview
Marketing
Marketing is led by US-based Evoke, the 
Group’s largest agency, which primarily 
specialises in the marketing of 
prescription drugs directly to patients. It 
also incorporates specialist Healthcare 
public relations agency Tonic and 
Healthcare Professional Marketing 
agencies First Hand and Nitrogen. 
During the year the division continued 
to make good progress in Healthcare 
Professional Marketing (HCP) and the 
growing area of Payer Marketing. Clients 
are increasingly looking for a single 
agency solution as healthcare marketing 
becomes more integrated, digital and 
seeks to reach multiple stakeholders. In 
this context, the combining of marketing 
agencies under one management team 
will create additional growth 
opportunities in 2018. Overall, the 
division continued to experience very 
strong growth this year, increasing 
revenue by 18% (13% on a like-for-like 
basis) to £73.6 million with operating 
profit increasing by 26% (16% on a 
like-for-like basis) to £15.5 million.
Medical
Medical is led by UK and US-based 
ApotheCom, which specialises in 
medical communications strategy, 
underpinned by data and analytics. The 
Group has been transformed over the 
past two years by strong leadership and 
an increased focus on consultancy led 
services which has resulted in record 
revenue growth and improved operating 
margins. The division grew revenue by 
22% (18% on a like-for-like basis) to 
£30.9 million with operating profit 
increasing by 40% (34% on a like-for-like 
basis) to £8.3 million. 
Huntsworth made strong 
progress in 2017 with  
all operating divisions 
growing profits.

Investment case
Healthcare focus
The Healthcare industry has a good 
long-term outlook, underpinned by 
strong fundamentals, including an 
ageing population and a rise in chronic 
health conditions. At the same time it is 
becoming increasingly competitive 
with the established pharma 
companies facing challenges from 
small biotech firms and other niche 
players. In this environment, Healthcare 
marketing services have an increasingly 
important role to play. 
Leading brands
Huntsworth’s businesses, in both the 
Healthcare and Communications 
divisions, operate under a range of 
strong, well-respected brands. Brands 
continue to be essential in a market 
which places a premium on 
trustworthy, quality businesses. Huntsworth plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Other Information

Immersive
Immersive is led by The Creative 
Engagement Group which joined 
Huntsworth in July 2017. The Creative 
Engagement Group, through its 
agencies, WRG, The Moment and Just, is 
focused on providing deeply immersive 
experiences in exhibitions, events, 
training and internal communications, 
mostly for healthcare clients. This 
division has great potential to grow in 
the US and expand its offering in internal 
communications and mixed media.  
The division delivered revenues of  
£14.9 million and operating profits of 
£1.9 million.
The Communications division is 
comprised of Grayling, Red and 
specialist financial agency Citigate Dewe 
Rogerson (CDR). The division achieved 
revenues of £77.6 million (2016: £89.3 
million), a decline of 7% on a like-for like 
basis, and operating profit of £7.0 million 
(2016: £5.5 million), an improvement of 
24% on a like-for like basis. Declining 
revenues were largely the result of 
closing loss-making agencies in Grayling 
in both 2016 and 2017.
During the year, Grayling has responded 
well to the prior year restructuring and 
has returned to profitability. This was led 
by the UK business which saw a 
particularly strong rebound in 
performance. Overall, Grayling reported 
revenues of £40.5 million, lower by 11% 
on a like-for-like basis, with operating 
profit of £1.1 million against a prior year 
loss of £0.8 million. Red had a good 
year, with revenue growth of 3% and 
operating profit growth of 4% despite a 
difficult marketplace and client churn 
largely driven by procurement-led 
tenders. The agency won a number of 
significant new mandates, and we 
anticipate little net effect on trading in 
2018. Citigate Dewe Rogerson 
performed solidly with revenues of 
£22.2 million (2016: £22.1 million) and 
operating profit of £3.5 million (2016: 
£3.6 million). The results reflect a mixed 
performance across the agency, with a 
strong performance in the Netherlands 
offset by a weaker UK performance. A 
quieter Asian market impacted the 
Greater China business early in the year, 
however, all CDR operations benefited 
from an improving market towards the 
end of the year.
Dividend
Given the strength of the Group’s 
performance, the Company will be 
proposing to increase its final dividend 
by 16% to 1.45p, giving a total dividend 
for the year of 2.0p, an increase of 14% 
on the previous year.
Group Outlook
Despite increasing foreign exchange 
headwinds, the Group remains well 
positioned for further growth. Our 
Marketing, Medical and Immersive 
divisions are continuing to grow on the 
back of multiple client wins, and the 
Communications division continues to 
make progress. Our focus is to better 
serve our Healthcare clients by 
developing and adding capability to the 
Group, and with a strengthening balance 
sheet we are well placed to continue to 
do so. Overall, we are well positioned for 
future growth and look forward to 
reporting further progress in 2018.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank our Chair Derek Mapp for his 
leadership in guiding us all through the 
restructure of Huntsworth to where we 
are today. His contribution through a 
period of significant change can be seen 
in these results and we are delighted 
that he will stay with us until a new Chair 
has been appointed.
