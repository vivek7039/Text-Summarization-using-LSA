 Chairman’s Statement
Generating value for all our stakeholders
While 2017’s market trends provided  
a welcome tailwind, they were  
anticipated by the Group and Weir  
was well positioned to act quickly  
and take full advantage of the upturn  
in both North American oil and gas  
and global mining markets. 
This led the Group to outperform these 
markets and in doing so reaffirmed the 
strength of its business model, the clarity 
of its strategy and quality of our near 
15,000 people around the world. The 
Board experienced this directly on a visit 
to South Africa, where the benefits of 
Weir’s culture and commitment to being 
an active partner in local communities  
was a real highlight. 
You can read more about the Board’s  
visit on page 81.
On behalf of the Board, I wish to record 
our gratitude to all Weir employees  
for their efforts throughout the year  
in delivering for our shareholders, 
customers and communities.
Financial results
I am pleased to report a strong year  
of growth for your Company. Reported 
revenues increased to £2,356m, up 28%. 
On a constant currency basis, revenues 
were 19% higher year-on-year. Pre-tax 
profits from continuing operations,  
before exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation, of £250m represent  
a 47% increase on the previous year. 
Reported profit after tax of £162m  
was up 274% from 2016.
You can read more in the Financial 
Review on page 24. 
Shareholder returns
We are proposing a final dividend 
payment of 29.0p per share, making 
44.0p for the full year. 
Sustainable growth
By definition, Weir, with its heritage 
stretching back to 1871, has proven  
itself to be a sustainable business.  
This has been achieved, amongst other 
things, by aligning the interests of the 
Group with those of the communities  
in which we operate. 
Dear Shareholder,
2017 saw the Group take full 
advantage of the improvement  
in our main markets by leveraging 
our business model and effectively 
delivering our strategy to produce 
increased value for our stakeholders.

Charles Berry
Chairman The Board recognises that the business 
will be more successful if it partners  
with stakeholders and makes a positive 
contribution to society. The Group does 
this in a variety of ways from supporting 
local employment and suppliers to 
working with governments and local 
communities to help educate the next 
generation of engineers. 
In the UK, this includes the Primary 
Engineer programme that aims to 
encourage young pupils from all 
backgrounds to consider a career 
in science, technology, engineering  
or mathematics. 
The Group is also promoting greater 
diversity and inclusion in a sector that  
has traditionally been male-dominated. 
The best ideas come from a variety of 
perspectives and, as a company that  
relies on the innovation and ingenuity of 
all our people, we need to be a workplace 
that allows everyone’s talent to flourish. 
The Board will reach its aim of ensuring 
that at least a third of its members are 
female following the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), two years ahead of our 
original 2020 target. 
While this is welcome progress, we  
must increase diversity throughout the 
organisation, from those starting out in 
their careers to senior leaders, and each 
business has plans in place to help them 
achieve this aim. 
Governance and Board changes
As previously announced, there were 
some significant changes to the 
composition of your Board in 2017. 
On 30 September, Melanie Gee stood 
down as a Non-Executive Director and 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
having served for six years. John Mogford 
and Alan Ferguson also announced during 
the year that they would not be seeking 
re-election at the 2018 AGM, having 
served ten and seven years respectively. 
I would like to formally record the  
Group’s thanks to Melanie, John and  
Alan for their exceptional service to  
Weir during their terms. 
Clare Chapman and Barbara Jeremiah 
joined the Board as Non-Executive 
Directors in August of 2017. Clare is  
the former Group People Director of  
BT Group plc and succeeded Melanie 
Gee as the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. Barbara, who is a former 
Executive Vice-President of Alcoa, joined 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
In January 2018, Stephen Young, former 
CEO of Meggitt plc, joined the Board and 
he will succeed Alan Ferguson as Audit 
Committee Chairman from 28 April 2018.
Looking ahead to the rest of 2018, the 
Board will focus on continuing to support 
CEO Jon Stanton as he executes our 
strategy and builds an even more 
sustainable business.
