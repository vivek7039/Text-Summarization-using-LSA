 Chief Executive Officer’s review 
our strategy is delivering profitable growth
stephen burns 
 “ Our enhanced 
offer and 
continued 
development 
of our brands 
is widening the 
appeal to our 
core family 
customer group.”
I am delighted to report on another very 
successful year for the Hollywood Bowl Group. 
We achieved revenue of £114.0m, representing 
growth of 8.8 per cent on FY2016, and 3.5 per 
cent on a like for like basis (LFL). We achieved 
this through the execution of our customer-led 
strategy by: improving game volumes and spend 
per game by delivering great value for money 
experiences; investing in our refurbishment 
programme; and growing the estate through 
our new openings and acquisition programme. 
Through all of this, we have seen Group adjusted 
EBITDA grow to £33.4m, a 13.7 per cent 
increase over the prior year, while operating 
profits grew by 54.4 per cent.
Hollywood Bowl Group is the UK’s ten-pin 
bowling market leader. We have a high quality, 
leasehold property portfolio of 58 centres across 
the UK and lead the market in profitability and 
margin. The Group is well placed to benefit 
from the widely reported and notable shift 
in behaviour of customers seeking to spend 
disposable income on experiences rather than 
material items. Our enhanced and evolving offer, 
as well as the continued development of our 
brands, is widening the appeal to our core family 
customer group, who are spending longer 
in our centres, and to our landlords, who are 
looking for high-quality leisure operators to 
supplement their retail offers. 
Strategic progress
Our simple strategy focuses on growing the 
business organically and driving growth through 
the effective deployment of capital, and we are 
very pleased with the progress we have made 
in FY2017.
Like-for-like growth
Improvements in LFL revenue performance 
have been underpinned by a number of factors, 
including increased customer visits year-on-year. 
Game volumes in the year were up 3.1 per cent 
LFL (and 8.5 per cent total). More of our target 
market sought out our high-quality family 
entertainment centres, and we were able 
to leverage our sector leading CRM system 
to encourage customers on our database to 
visit us again via targeted marketing activity. 
We have worked hard expanding the roll out 
of proven initiatives and on introducing new 
concepts to enhance the customer experience. 
The continuing roll out of the Hollywood Diner 
menu has enhanced the quality of our products, 
as well as drive dwell time in our diners. The new 
menu is now in 30 centres and will be rolled out 
to the rest of the estate over the coming year. 
The highly successful VIP concept is now in 
40 centres and is a fantastic upgrade for our 
customers at just an extra £1 per player per 
game. Our high-quality amusement offer has 
been further enhanced with the test of virtual 
reality gaming in three of our centres, an 
exciting new experience. We are also testing 
our new cashless amusement offer as we look 
to proactively anticipate customer needs 
and demands.
The dynamic pricing model we introduced in 
July enabled us to strategically increase prices 
without impacting the Group’s relative price 
competitiveness or damaging our reputation 
for being a great value-for-money experience 
(our prices remain amongst the lowest of the 
major ten-pin bowling operators).

Strategic Report All of these initiatives, as well as the fantastic 
teams we have in our centres, have contributed 
to our spend per game growing from £8.63 
to £8.70 in FY2017. 
Refurbishment and rebrand 
programme
Ten full refurbishments were completed 
in FY2017 including the rebranding of four 
Bowlplex and two AMF centres (Tunbridge 
Wells, Cwmbran, Portsmouth, Brighton, Tolworth 
and Ashford). Over 60 per cent of the estate has 
now been refurbished with each project benefiting 
from those that have gone before, resulting in 
exceptional industry leading environments. In 
consequence, we continue to deliver impressive 
returns from the capital deployed, with the ten 
refurbishments on track to outperform their 
targeted 33 per cent return on investment.
New centre openings
Our disciplined approach to centre roll out 
has been key to delivering the high returns 
and sustained performance we have seen from 
our mature centres. One of our key success 
criteria is being co-located with the top cinema 
in town. Over 70% of our current estate fulfils this 
criterion, and our recent openings have 
continued on this path. 
We opened three centres in FY2017, two 
of which – Southampton and Derby – were 
organic openings, while The London O2 was 
an acquisition. Each property negotiation is 
based on its own merits and we continue to 
be a sought-after tenant for both leisure parks 
and retail developments. 
Hollywood Bowl Southampton opened as 
part of a new Hammerson leisure development. 
It is one of our smaller format concept centres 
designed to fit within a retail/leisure offer. 
Trading since the opening in December 2016 
has been extremely positive, and it is on course 
to pay back 50 per cent of the invested capital 
within year one. 
Our second new opening is part of intu Derby 
and complements the site’s high-quality offering 
of a cinema, casual dining restaurants, retail and 
an adventure golf centre. Derby is trading very 
well and is ahead of expectation.
Both of these new centres included the 
operational trials of ‘Pins on strings’ technology 
– an innovation to improve machine reliability 
and cut downtime – and cashless amusements, 
a trial of digital payment card readers that can 
facilitate price changes and greater customer 
engagement.
Acquisitions 
In June, we refurbished and rebranded Brooklyn 
Bowl at The London O2, taking a three-year 
management contract to operate the venue. 
Early trading has been in line with our expectations. 
In FY2017 we also acquired the Namco Bowl 
in Dagenham, a 30,000 square foot centre in a 
prime spot co-located with a cinema and casual 
dining. This centre started trading on 4 October 
2017 and is performing in line with expectations.
Pipeline
We have secured a strong pipeline of new 
centres enabling us to deliver on our plan of 
an average of two new openings per year. The 
high-quality product we deliver for our landlords, 
coupled with our strong covenant and reputation 
for top-quality operating standards, have created 
new opportunities. Leases have been signed 
with intu for the leisure extension at its flagship 
Lakeside centre and for the leisure extension 
of intu Watford. 
Legal work is progressing on a number of other 
exciting new developments, giving us confidence 
in our longer term growth opportunities.
Our people
Our people are instrumental to the success 
of our business and I am enormously grateful 
to be supported by a talented, enthusiastic and 
motivated team who are incredibly professional, 
customer-focused and commercially driven.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT We are proud to provide an inclusive and 
supportive environment for all team members, 
including good opportunities to develop 
rewarding careers. 127 of the team have 
undertaken our internal talent development 
programmes, with 36 team members being 
promoted to assistant manager, seven to 
Centre Manager and five to a senior support 
role as a consequence.
Given the diversity of our portfolio, and the 
unique markets in which we operate, we take 
care to recruit only the most engaging and 
energetic team members, strong people 
with an entrepreneurial approach. Our centre 
management teams are rewarded for work well 
done through our uncapped bonus scheme.
Technology-driven growth
We continue to invest in our technology 
platforms which are a key enabler of our 
growth. We have moved our core reservation 
and CRM system infrastructure on to a cloud-
based service, improving its resilience, 
scalability and performance.
Our proprietary scoring system is now in 
24 centres. The system was upgraded earlier 
in the year to increase in-centre data capture 
and enhance customer engagement levels through 
the inclusion of additional personalised content in 
our automated post-bowling email programmes 
which generated an overall 41 per cent increase in 
revenue year-on-year. Our contactable customer 
marketing database has grown by nine per cent in 
the last 12 months. Along with our automated and 
tactical programmes, it is a key revenue driving 
asset as it facilitates the promotion of short term, 
closed user-group offers that deliver incremental 
revenues in more challenging trading periods.
Our online channel continues to perform 
well and take share from our walk-up channel. 
Revenues are up 26 per cent year-on-year 
supported by increased and cost-effective 
investment in digital advertising and the 
introduction of dynamic pricing. Alongside this, 
our ongoing focus on improving our customers’ 
booking journey saw mobile conversion levels 
increase. Mobile accounted for 54 per cent 
of our online revenue.
Outlook
Off the back of another successful year, we 
are well positioned to continue the delivery of 
our strategy in FY2018. We have a high-quality 
estate, we have added four new centres in the 
last 12 months and we continue to invest capital 
to enhance our offering across the portfolio. 
With continued investment into our teams, 
including multiple management training/talent 
programmes, we are well placed to further 
enhance our customer proposition. Our growing 
scale and revenues mean that we can continue 
to leverage operational efficiencies, increasing 
our profits as a percentage of revenue.
My team and I invest a great deal of time and 
effort in assessing new centre opportunities 
as well as ensuring we continue to invest in 
the most appropriate parts of our estate to 
provide the latest innovation and technology 
to our customers.
There is much talk in the press and elsewhere 
of the impact of ‘Brexit’. We do not believe that 
the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU will 
have an impact on the underlying performance 
of our business because Hollywood Bowl, and 
the activities we offer, have great customer 
appeal throughout the country and through 
all economic cycles.
Finally, I would like to thank all of our team 
members for their hard work during FY2017 
and I look forward to working alongside them 
to deliver our priorities for FY2018.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Strategic Report
hollywood bowl group plc 20 Q.  What keeps you awake at night?
SB. Not having the right team in place in our centres to deliver 
the consistent experience our customers expect. A high-quality 
management team makes all the difference in the successful 
operation of our business, which is why attracting and retaining 
talent is at the top of the leadership agenda.
Q.  Could you accelerate the rate 
of centre openings?
SB. While we can be flexible in the design of our centres, we do 
need a reasonable amount of open space (columns, for example, 
are difficult to bowl around!). This can limit our opportunities. We are 
also careful to open in only those locations that will complement our 
existing portfolio, rather than detract from it. It’s no fun running 
loss-making centres and we are in the enviable position of not 
having any of those. We have identified a very healthy pipeline, but 
these new openings are part of some very big schemes that take 
time to come out of the ground, so we are sticking to our forecast 
of an average of two openings per annum.
Q.  Have you the management bandwidth to match 
your ambitions for growth? 
SB. Absolutely! I am fortunate to be surrounded by a talented, 
supportive and motivated senior leadership team who not only 
are experts in their respective function, but are also extremely 
knowledgeable about the overall business.
Q.  Could you further increase the rate of the 
refurbishment programme?
SB. It’s important to understand that each centre operates in its 
own marketplace and we don’t adopt a ‘cookie cutter’ approach 
when it comes to refurbishments and investments. Each centre 
is designed around customer feedback, with input from the 
management and support team. Combining this with the fact that 
we wouldn’t undertake a refurbishment during a school holiday 
period, for example, and that Laurence (CFO) and I visit every 
centre before, during and after investment, we believe that 
between seven and ten investments per annum allows the 
business to maximise the returns on each. 
Q.  Are you concerned about the consumer outlook?
SB. It is, of course, prudent to keep one eye on consumer trends. 
We recognise that leisure activities rely on disposable income and 
that our customers are not immune to inflation. We do, however, 
operate the kind of all-inclusive family leisure experience that we 
know our customers prioritise. 
Q.  Will you ever look beyond bowling?
SB. Our short to medium-term focus is on delivering against our 
growth plan through the successful execution of our bowling-led 
strategy. There are a number of indoor leisure-based offerings we 
know could benefit from our customer-led operating model, but 
we feel there is still significant opportunity to remain focused on 
growing our bowling business.
Q.  What impact will Brexit have on 
Hollywood Bowl?
SB. In terms of our team, we have limited exposure with less than 
four per cent of team members coming from EU countries outside 
of the UK. Our supply chain is mostly UK-based. Although we 
haven’t been immune to the cost increases of certain food lines, 
they form a relatively small part of our business and, at this stage, 
we haven’t had to pass any price rises on to our customers. The 
likely economic impact of Brexit will become clearer over the next 
18 months and is something we will watch closely as regards the 
business and the impact on our customers. 
Q.  What differentiates Hollywood Bowl from other 
leisure investment opportunities?
SB. We have a unique product that has wide appeal across 
all ages, demographics and geographies. There are few such 
businesses that offer activities you can safely enjoy with your 
family, friends and business colleagues – and all have fun! As an 
investment, we differentiate by continuing to operate this business 
for the long term and by not taking short-term decisions which 
could harm long-term profitability. Our portfolio of entirely 
profitable centres is operated by business leaders, not just 
managers, and a senior team that are not only long-term 
shareholders of the business, but also its customers.
