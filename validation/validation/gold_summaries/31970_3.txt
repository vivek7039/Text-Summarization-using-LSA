04 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Performance overview
I am pleased to report our 2017 annual 
results. We achieved a record turnover 
of £536.8m with an underlying revenue 
growth of 14% at constant exchange 
rates*. We report an adjusted profit 
before tax of £109.1m* and a statutory 
profit before tax of £117.1m, an 
increase of 25% on an adjusted basis. 
Our total shareholder return during the 
year was 67%, ranking Renishaw in 
the top 25 in both the FTSE 250 and 
FTSE 350.
Renishaw is a long-term business 
and we remain committed to strategic 
investments and R&D. In addition, 
over the past year, we have focused 
on underperforming business areas 
resulting in our discontinuing the 
activities of Renishaw Diagnostics 
Limited and the spatial measurement 
business. In spite of the potential 
headwinds brought about by the 
uncertainty of Brexit, we remain 
confident of future growth due 
to our innovative product base, 
extensive global sales and marketing 
presence, and relevance to high-
value manufacturing.
Revenue
We achieved record turnover with 
revenue for the year ended 30th June 
2017 of £536.8m, compared with 
a restated £427.2m for last year, an 
increase of 26%. There was underlying 
revenue growth of 14% with the 
balance arising from exchange rate 
movements compared to the prior year.

Profit and earnings per share
During the year, it was established 
that certain foreign currency forward 
contracts used as hedging instruments 
for future incoming currency cash flows 
did not qualify for hedge accounting. 
This has resulted in the prior year profit 
before tax being restated and as a 
consequence the Board has introduced 
an alternative performance measure, 
adjusted profit before tax, to report 
the profitability on the basis that all 
forward contracts are accounted for as 
effective hedges. This measure will be

There was strong growth in our 
encoder, measurement and 
automation, calibration and 
coordinate measuring machine (CMM) 
product lines.
Adjusted operating profit for our 
metrology business was £115.9m 
(2016 restated: £90.0m). 
We have continued to invest in 
research and development, with total 
engineering costs in this business 
segment of £68.8m (before net 
capitalised development costs and the 
R&D tax credit) compared to a restated 
2016 of £60.9m, with a number of new 
product launches during the year. 
In our CMM product line, we 
launched a new, improved surface 
finish measurement probe for use 
with our REVO
®
 5-axis measurement 
system. The laser calibration product 
line launched the XM-60 multi-axis 
calibrator. Designed for the machine 
tool market, it is a highly accurate 
laser system used to capture multiple 
machine errors in a single set-up. In our 
encoder product line, we launched 
the VIONiC™ series, a new range of 
ultra-high accuracy, super-compact 
all-in-one digital incremental encoders.

Statutory profit before tax for the year 
was £117.1m compared to a restated 
£61.7m last year. Statutory earnings 
per share on continuing activities were 
141.3p compared to 71.8p last year.
This year’s tax charge on continuing 
operations amounts to £14.3m (2016 
restated: £10.0m) representing a 
tax rate of 12.2% (2016 restated: 
16.2%). The tax rate has benefited 
from the continued phasing in of the 
patent box tax regime and a reduction 
in the UK tax rate applied when 
calculating certain deferred tax assets 
and liabilities.
Metrology
Revenue from our metrology business 
for the year was £503.4m compared 
with a restated £398.9m last year.

Revenue from our healthcare business 
for the year was £33.4m, an increase 
of 18% over the £28.4m last year. 
We experienced growth in all our 
product lines.
Healthcare also saw continued 
investment in research and 
development, with total engineering 
costs in this business segment 
of £9.2m (before net capitalised 
development costs and the R&D tax 
credit) compared to a restated 2016 of 
£7.9m.
In our spectroscopy product line, we 
introduced the RA802 pharmaceutical 
analyser, designed exclusively for the 
pharmaceutical industry, enabling users 
to formulate tablets more efficiently 
by speeding up the analysis of tablet 
composition and structure.
The neurological product line continued 
to make sales of our stereotactic robot 
and associated neuroinspire planning 
software, with further sales in the UK, 
USA and Canada.
The medical dental product line has 
experienced good growth resulting 
from a continued focus on sales of 
additive manufacturing technologies 
into the healthcare market.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 06 There was an adjusted operating loss 
of £7.2m, compared with a restated 
loss of £3.1m last year. We remain 
focused on moving this business 
sector into profit, where we have 
implemented a number of initiatives 
and are restructuring the neurological 
and medical dental businesses.
Discontinued activities
As reported in our October 2016 
trading update, the Board decided to 
discontinue operations at Renishaw 
Diagnostics Limited (RDL), resulting 
in the closure of the business. 
Subsequently, certain assets of the 
business have been sold.
The RDL business has been accounted 
for as a discontinued activity, with 
comparative figures for the previous 
year being restated accordingly. 
The loss after tax of £3.3m accounted 
for as a discontinued activity comprises 
the running costs for RDL, including 
cessation costs and impairment write 
offs for assets and goodwill, less 
amounts received. The loss after tax for 
the prior year was £2.5m.
In June 2017, after an extensive review 
of the spatial measurement business, 
the Board decided to discontinue 
this line of business. Including a 
goodwill impairment charge of £6.7m 
and provisions for the cessation of 
the trade, there was a net loss in 
this business for the year of £10.6m 
(2016: £1.5m).
Continued investment for  
long-term growth
The Group continues its strategy to 
invest for the long term, expanding 
our global marketing and distribution 
infrastructure, along with increasing 
manufacturing capacity and 
research and development activities. 
This year saw the completion of 
our new USA headquarters near 
Chicago and the sale of the previous 
premises. New facilities have also 
been completed in Detroit (USA) 
with expansion and refurbishment in 
Spain, Sweden, Hungary, Germany 
and France. We also converted our 
representative office in Turkey into a 
trading subsidiary to facilitate solution 
selling in the territory.
Our workforce at the end of June 2017 
was 4,530, an increase of 244 in the 
year, of which 91 were apprentices 
and graduates taken on as part of our 
on-going commitment to train and 
develop skilled resource for the Group 
in the future. 
Capital expenditure on property, 
plant and equipment for the year was 
£42.6m, of which £24.2m was spent 
on property and £18.4m on plant 
and equipment. 
Working capital
Group inventory decreased from 
£95.0m at the start of the year 
to £87.7m. We continue to focus 
on working capital management 
whilst remaining committed to our 
policy of holding sufficient finished 
inventory to ensure customer delivery 
performance, given our short order 
book of approximately five weeks. 
Trade debtors increased from £114.9m 
to £137.5m, with debtor days 
outstanding at the end of the current 
year at 73 days (2016: 70 days).
Net cash balances at 30th June 2017 
were £51.9m, compared with £21.3m 
at 30th June 2016. Additionally, there 
is an escrow account of £12.9m 
(2016: £15.3m) relating to the provision 
of security to the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme.

Chairman’s  
statement

*Previous year figures have been restated for the following:
1.  The results of Renishaw Diagnostics Limited and the spatial measurement 
business have been excluded, as these businesses have been reclassified as 
discontinued activities.
2.  The R&D tax credit, previously accounted for within the income tax expense line, has 
been reclassified to cost of sales, thereby showing it as part of the profit before tax. 
This reclassification increased the profit before tax by £2.4m for the year ended 30th 
June 2016.
3.  It has been established that certain foreign currency forward contracts used as 
hedging instruments for future incoming currency cash flows did not qualify for 
hedge accounting as they did not meet the hedge effectiveness criteria set out in 
the International Accounting Standard IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’. To ensure technical compliance with this standard it has been 
necessary to restate the 2016 financial statements resulting in a £25.8m reduction to 
the profit before tax for that year and a corresponding increase in other comprehensive 
income. The consolidated net assets and cash balances were not impacted by the 
prior year adjustment and the future cash flows remain unchanged.
Alternative performance measures
Alternative performance measures are – Revenue at constant exchange rates, Adjusted 
profit before tax, Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted operating profit. 
Revenue at constant exchange rates is defined as revenue recalculated using the same 
rates as were applicable to the previous year and excluding forward contract gains 
and losses.

group (see note 24).
