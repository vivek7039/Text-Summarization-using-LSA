 Sir Richard Lapthorne
Chairman
2017 has been an encouraging 
year for the Group. We have seen 
a return to overall revenue growth 
for the first time in five years, 
product innovation and international 
adaptation of new products is 
starting to take shape and a clear 
role has emerged for our reorganised 
central team, now located in Leeds. 
This has been accompanied by 
prudent management of our 
capital resources where we now 
have sufficient funds available to 
meet the up-front costs associated 
with our growth ambitions. 
Chairman’s statement
How we look at our business
The changing nature of the Group and how 
we manage its component parts has led to a 
reappraisal of how we measure our businesses  
Historically, the Group viewed its businesses 
by country and region with no differentiation 
reflecting the different nature of the businesses 
within each country  In 2018 we will refine this to 
show three different sources of revenue and cost  
These are the historic back book ‘Restricted 
Operations’ with activities in UK, Italy, Portugal, 
Malaysia and Hong Kong; the unconstrained 
operating businesses, ‘Ongoing Operations’, 
in each of these countries plus India, Turkey, 
Spain, Germany and Mexico; and a third category 
covering ‘Investments’ being made for new and/or 
expanded activities in the countries in our ongoing 
operations  This category currently includes China 
The back book businesses are run with the 
objective of effectively managing the customer 
experience and minimising the annual decline 
with low associated development costs  Equally, 
administrative costs will mirror any further 
declines in renewals  
The results from the operating businesses will 
be the key driver of value as they clearly show 
the true direction of travel in both revenue and 
margins and this assessment will be facilitated by 
investment costs being shown separately in the 
sector analysis  This treatment is necessary as 
we employ little fixed capital and consequently 
investments, which can be substantial, can have 
a negative impact on the income statement in the 
short term before any return is realised  Internally, 
all projects under this heading require full Board 
approval as if they were fixed capital investments 
The 2017 Accounts have been prepared using the 
prior system for sector analysis 
Progress to date
On completion of the major strategy review referred 
to in last year’s report, resources have been shifted 
away from a highly centralised style to one of 
providing appropriate support to all our businesses 
whether in the rapidly developing markets in India, 
China and Turkey, the more mature markets such 
as Germany and southern Europe, or the newly 
established UK business  This more decentralised 
model gives greater responsibility and 
accountability to the operational businesses 
In December 2017, Blink UK received permission 
from the FCA to commence trading as a regulated 
insurance intermediary and it is through this entity 
that we will seek to reinvigorate our UK presence  
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 10 We continue to see the UK market as an important 
component of our global business 
The technical expertise of Blink is also being used 
to help us develop innovative product solutions 
such as the recent launch of Owl in Turkey  We 
will continue to seek product extensions to our 
portfolio and, as a further example, we were pleased 
recently to announce our investment in a minority 
shareholding in KYND Limited (KYND), a business 
set up to address cyber security monitoring and 
diagnostics for large and SME businesses that are 
facing a critical need to address the risks involved 
within their IT infrastructures  
Culture and values
Our business distributes products through long 
term partnership arrangements, B2B2C  Quality 
of approach and high integrity are essential for 
sustainable success and, having made good progress 
in fundamentally changing the organisation, 
we recognise the need to ensure we have the right 
people in the right place in the right roles  The 
Board has approved significant investment in 
developing an open, honest and authentic culture 
that extends consistently throughout the business  
The Board
I was pleased to welcome two new Directors to 
the Board during the year, Oliver Laird as Chief 
Financial Officer and Tim Elliott as Non-Executive 
Director and Audit Committee Chairman  Oliver 
and Tim have both already made a significant 
contribution to the Board and the Group  
Governance
The Board remains committed to maintaining high 
standards of governance, both at a corporate level 
and operationally throughout the business  
Notwithstanding the increased autonomy of our 
individual businesses, the Board recognises the 
importance of retaining clear oversight and a ‘flat’ 
organisation structure, with Country CEOs reporting 
direct to the Group CEO, helps to ensure that this 
is the case  Other Board members also maintain 
regular contact with all parts of the business, with 
frequent visits to our overseas operations 
Performance
The Group’s revenue growth in the year has been 
largely driven by India, where we are beginning to see 
the fruits of strategies and investments implemented 
over the last 12 to 18 months  Although the Group 
profit before tax shows an increase compared to 
2016, underlying operating profit is lower  This is a 
result of the shift in revenue mix from high margin 
back book products in the UK and Spain, to primarily 
India where the strong trading performance comes 
from products which produce lower margins 
The planned change to our segmental reporting 
structure will, we believe, provide our stakeholders 
with a much clearer analysis of the Group’s progress 
over time 
The Board has approved this Annual Report & 
Accounts as being fair , balanced and understandable, 
providing the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy 
Looking ahead
Having already implemented a good proportion 
of the plans we made in 2016, the business is 
well placed to continue its growth in 2018 and 
beyond  Our simplified operating structure 
enables us to operate more efficiently with a lower 
cost base and the increase in available cash 
following the release of some of our regulatory 
restrictions and the sale of our York premises 
gives us the ability to seek expansion through 
organic product innovation, product acquisitions 
and new and/or expanded partnerships 
As well as continued growth in India, we see 
potential for substantial growth in China, and, with 
that in mind, have made a significant investment 
in standalone IT and digital capability and in 
expanding our team there  
During the middle part of 2018, we will 
incorporate CPP Bangladesh, a market which 
we have not previously explored and where we 
see great potential for our products, combined 
with our regional approach to marketing  Initially, 
significant support will be provided through 
the extension of our successful Indian 
business model to this market 
Once again, on behalf of the Board I would like 
to thank all our colleagues for their continued 
commitment, hard work and support during the 
year and look forward to working with you all as we 
continue to rebuild our business
