FY17 has been another busy and productive year, during which we have expanded our product portfolio; 
launched two new brands; and refined our growth strategy to optimise our expansion opportunities now 
and for the future.
 – Strong growth continued across both our major 
segments, Focusrite and Novation
 – In Focusrite, Scarlett, Clarett and RedNet 
ranges all grew leading to total segment revenue 
growth of 18.6%
 – In Novation, the growth of Launchpad and 
Launchkey both accelerated resulting in segment 
revenue growth of 37.8%
 – All major geographic regions grew, including the 
USA, our largest market, where revenue growth 
was 30.9% in the year
 – Ten new products launched over the year with 
positive early industry and user feedback
 – Continued investment in the Software division 
has generated continued growth – now three 
apps with approximately 550,000 active users
 – e-commerce website now established and 
delivering products globally
1 Comprising of earnings adjusted for interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and non-underlying items (see page 21).
2 Adjusted for non-underlying items (see note 13).
3 Constant currency revenue growth is calculated by taking the sterling value of FY17 revenue; converting to FY16 annual average exchange rates and comparing with the 
reported revenue for FY16. In addition, all foreign exchange movements disclosed in revenue are excluded from both years.
