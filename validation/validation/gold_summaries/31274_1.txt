 WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017––––––– 10
Stem cell therapy is gaining increasing recognition for its
life-saving potential in a wide-range of medical
applications. 82 illnesses can currently be treated using
stem cell procedures, and developments in its use in
illnesses such as cystic ﬁbrosis, cerebral palsy, diabetes
and autism have caught the headlines of late. As the value
potential of this innovative treatment advances, more and
more people are becoming aware of the beneﬁts of
storing stem cells, which in turn is driving additional
development and advancement in the industry. This is
accordingly an opportune time to be building a leading
position within the stem cell industry and having
successfully launched our ﬁrst of its kind end-to-end stem
cell service that covers storage, insurance, research and
education/training, we are now focused on achieving
global roll-out to build revenues, drive development and
ultimately ensure that all people, regardless of geography
or ﬁnancial position, have access to stem cell treatment.
Through ﬁrst-hand experience, I have identiﬁed both the
value potential and the limitations of the industry in which
we operate. In terms of value potential, we are focused on
cord blood, taken from the umbilical cord following birth,
as we believe it is the most useful and best “quality” source
of stem cells and it is an area of rapid growth, with more
than 250,000 samples being stored per annum and
growing fast. However, looking at the limitations, whilst
over 4,000,000 people have stored cord blood with over
500 cord blood bank companies that exist worldwide,
paying c.£2,000 to do so, many do not realise that if
treatment is needed costs could climb to as high as
£300,000, making it unaffordable for many. It is because
of these limitations and strong growth dynamics that we
have created our end-to-end stem cell service. 
At the core of this offering is our highly innovative CellPlan
product – the ﬁrst global stem cell insurance package.
This provides access to stem cell specialists and hospitals,
covering the whole family for up to £/€1 million worth of
medical, travel and accommodation expenses worldwide
for an affordable £150-£300 per annum. With CellPlan live
in the UK and strategic agreements in place to launch in
Spain, Brazil, Thailand, India and Singapore in the coming

year it is clear to see that our focus is now on achieving
roll-out on a commercial scale. Of course, critical to stem
cell treatment is stem cell storage and so alongside
CellPlan, we are delighted to have recently launched our
own stem cell storage services at our state of the art
facilities at the Institute of Stem Cell Technology in
Manchester, UK. Following landmark licencing approval
from the Human Application Licence in February 2018, our
BabyCells service, offering umbilical cord blood and tissue
storage services to clients in the UK and Europe, is now
live and we are accordingly focused on promoting uptake.
BabyCells will be charged at a cost of circa £2,000 per
sample for one year’s storage (including collection and
processing), with recurring storage revenues of
£50-£75 per annum thereafter and alternative multi-year
pre-paid storage plans. Clients of BabyCells will be also
offered one year’s stem cell insurance cover, provided by
CellPlan, highlighting the synergistic offering of our
tripartite business model. 
The ﬁnal string to our offering is education and training
focused services, delivered through a bespoke online
platform – Wideacademy – of which we launched the ﬁrst
stage in February 2018. Being spearheaded by the former
Director of Apple Education, Alan Greenberg,
Wideacademy is committed to utilising the power of
education to support stem cell uptake across all levels of
the industry, with revenue opportunities available through
educational tools and courseware targeted at medical
professionals. 
Looking ahead, it is clear to see that 2018 is set to be
incredibly active for WideCells Group. Having successfully
launched all three divisions/services, our primary focus is
now on driving product update to deliver strong recurring
revenues and realise meaningful value for our investors,
whilst providing our clients with an affordable and quality
product offering that provides them with life-saving
medical cover for them and their family, now and for
many years to come. In line with our commitment to
being at the fore of the rapidly growing global stem cell
industry, we maintain an active growth strategy and will
continue to target strategic opportunities that provide our
company with value uplift opportunity, but our ﬁrst and
foremost focus is on building the proﬁle and global reach
of our innovative stem cell services.
