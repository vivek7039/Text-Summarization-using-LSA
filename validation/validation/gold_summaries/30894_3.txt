LAUNCH OF STRATEGY FOR 
NEXT PHASE OF GROWTH
I joined the Communisis Board last March and was appointed 
to the chair at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May. 
These preliminary results are therefore my first as Chairman 
of your Company. 
The past twelve months have confirmed my initial views about the 
strength of the business. A track record of growth backed by strong cash 
generation has been established over several years. We perform mission 
critical work at scale for very substantial clients across the Financial 
Services and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sectors. We are 
significantly invested in our people, systems and infrastructure to fulfil 
data-sensitive, regulation-mandated customer communications, at 
high volumes and to manage complex, time-critical multinational 
product programmes for some of the world’s biggest brands. We are 
differentiated from our competitor/comparator set in many ways. Our 
long-term client retention levels are sector-leading.
The foundation for further success is therefore in place. To build 
upon it we have now set ourselves one key priority which is to raise 
the underlying profitability of the business in a sustainable way.
The Value Enhancement Programme (VEP) which we are launching, 
is a three-year plan to deliver enhanced returns to our shareholders 
by raising the demonstrable value we deliver to our clients.
Under the VEP we will launch a series of digital and data-led client 
initiatives which will include providing complete format and channel 
flexibility for client communications; building out added value 
services in allied areas such as fraud protection and data security 
and developing data analytics driven insight programmes to give 
clients greater visibility of enhancement opportunities. We also 
continue our commitment to embrace process innovation to deliver 
cost efficiency without compromising effectiveness of output. 
The core aim of the VEP will be to evidence consistently that our 
clients will drive higher returns on their investment with us than they 
can either with alternative providers or by retaining in house the 
activity in which we specialise. Communisis will not be the lowest 
price option - we are not a commodity level provider - but we will 
partner with our clients to deliver the highest returns on their spend.
The VEP is our practical response to three key strategic themes of our 
business: Digital First, Global Reach and Empowered Organisation.
• Digital First recognises that an increasing proportion of the 
customers of our clients now prefer to communicate online. This 
now established trend will have a notable effect on our transactional 
business over time. It is our intention to take a still more pro-active 
lead with Digital and put it at the forefront of our transactional 
business. We will do that by accelerating existing organic 
developments, working with a range of technology partners and 
where appropriate acquiring the necessary skills and experience to 
strengthen our core propositions. We believe the time is ripe to enrich 
customer dialogue through the meaningful application of Digital - it 
is about a lot more than saving postage costs. 
FULL YEAR DIVIDEND PER SHARE
2.66p
(2016 2.42p)
Communisis delivered a strong set 
of results in 2017 . It was especially 
pleasing to see further growth in 
adjusted diluted EPS, solid free cash 
flow and a significant reduction in 
net debt.
The final dividend for the year is 
proposed at 1.77p which added to 
the interim dividend of 0.89p gives a 
total of 2.66p, a 10% increase on the 
previous year.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Strategic Report

CASE STUDY
FMCG BRAND
COUNTERING RETAIL OVERLOAD
Introducing customers to a wider range 
of products was a challenge that 
produced excellent results. Before they 
came to us, over 75% of the coffee brand’s 
sales came from just two products, 
making the need for more emphasis on 
their wider portfolio stronger than ever. 
Our team devised a new campaign that 
involved segmenting each brand into a 
range of different coffee-drinking 
occasions. This has helped to transform 
this brand and remains hugely popular 
and successful among consumers today. 
NEW SPLIT OF SALES 
Digital transformation will have other positive impacts on 
Communisis. For example it will allow us to extend the application of 
data analytics as a service and capture opportunities for the 
digitisation of our services for marketing execution.
• Global Reach is the recognition that many of our clients are truly 
international businesses and expect our services to be available in 
an increasing number of territories. We already have 30% of our 
sales in overseas markets and a prudent approach in EMEA has 
seen our network expand through our main hubs in Paris, Madrid, 
Rome, Warsaw and Frankfurt and eastward as far as Istanbul 
and Dubai. We have announced that we will be opening an office 
in Hong Kong for the sourcing of “premiums”; the gifts which 
accompany many purchases of luxury goods. This move will make 
us more responsive in this growth area and contribute to increased 
margins by taking more direct control of these supply chains. 
Heartened by the good progress Editions has made in New Y ork 
in 2017 with financial services clients, we aim to significantly 
enhance our presence in the USA. The three main opportunity 
areas we have identified are: further growth for Editions in content 
marketing, mostly in financial services; scope to access marketing 
execution services under our existing master relationships with 
brand owners; and digital transactional communications.
• Empowered Organisation covers a range of initiatives designed 
to make Communisis progressively more efficient and valuable. 
From a client perspective it is about our becoming still more 
integrated into client workflows to give them greater visibility and 
understanding of the impact of their communication and marketing 
execution choices and surfacing opportunities to enhance their 
efficiency or effectiveness or both. From a Communisis commercial 
perspective, this involves driving fresh marketing and commercial 
initiatives to deliver the right pipeline of growth opportunities. 
Communisis will selectively target the business it is best equipped to 
deliver and where it can retain more of the value which it creates for 
its clients. The structure of contracts will adapt accordingly. From an 
organisational perspective we are fuelling this by devolving more 
direct P&L responsibility into the hands of our local site and country 
managers, empowering them to drive the profitability of their 
discrete business units entrepreneurially. 
Communisis remains committed to delivering enhanced returns to its 
shareholders.  The announcement of our three-year VEP is a new 
expression of that commitment. Alongside investing capital in pursuit 
of that growth, we will continue to ensure that a strong dividend 
remains a key component of our total shareholder returns policy.
