Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Success and succession
We have made further solid 
progress across all our 
divisions at Stobart Group this 
year including taking full 
ownership of our airline, 
Stobart Air, and aircraft leasing 
business, Propius, and 
increasing the number of 
routes from London Southend 
Airport. Our key biomass 
processing sites are up and 
running and we continue to 
realise outstanding value from 
the property and investment 
portfolios. We remain confident 
we can achieve our published 
objectives for each division.
Strategy and Delivery
Our Group’s strategy for our five divisions 
is well established and good progress 
has been made during the year. Please 
refer to the Strategic Framework on 
pages 2-3, and the Operational Review 
on pages 14-26 to read about our 
strategy and progress.
T o take one example, our Eddie Stobart 
Logistics investment, of which we now 
own 12.5%, has yielded a great return 
with the promise of further returns to 
come. The recent IPO realised cash for 
the Group of £113.3m from the sale of 
36.5% of the Group’s original 49% 
investment. The company, known as 
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc, has 
announced the intention to pay a 2017 
dividend and implement a progressive 
dividend policy. The decision to hold 49% 
after the 2014 realisation has proved to 
be a good one and we anticipate our 
remaining 12.5% investment, worth 
£71.5m at the date of the IPO, will 
continue to grow in value.
Board Stability and Succession
We have had a very stable Board 
in recent years with no changes 
to the Non-Executive Directors 
since the current members were 
appointed in 2013 and 2014.
Andrew Tinkler founded Stobart 
Group, and has been the CEO since 
its flotation in 2007. During this time, 
he has been an entrepreneurial driving 
force, initially transforming the fortunes 
of the Eddie Stobart business and 
then setting the strategy of the Group 
today, which includes the fast-growing 
Energy and Aviation businesses. 
He has also overseen the value 
improvement and realisation of the 
Group’s property portfolio delivering 
consistent returns to shareholders.
In December 2016, we announced that 
Warwick Brady would be joining the 
Group as Deputy Group CEO, having 
previously been COO of easyJet plc. 
Warwick’s recruitment provided the 
Group with further aviation expertise 
and broader management capability. 
Also, earlier in July 2016, we announced 
that Ben Whawell was to step down 
from the Board and become the CEO 
GOOD GOVERNANCE
Allied to entrepreneurial flair, 
strong governance is critical for 
success at Stobart. I am pleased 
that the Board has been stable 
and fully compliant with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 
over the last financial year. 
Board and governance achievements 
in the last 18 months:
  Set out strategy following the  
partial disposal of the Transport 
and Distribution business.
  Held full strategy review 
meetings with the divisional 
management in  
September 2016.
  Completed Board evaluation 
and set an action plan.

STRATEGIC 
REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
of Stobart’s Energy division, providing 
strong, experienced and dedicated 
leadership at a very important phase of 
its development. These appointments 
meant that the Group has strong 
leadership in place in key positions, 
and allowed the Board to further 
develop plans for succession and long 
term value creation. We are pleased 
to announce that Warwick will join 
the Board and be appointed as the 
Group’s CEO following June’s AGM.
Andrew will continue as an Executive 
Board member, giving the Board 
continued access to his input at Group 
level. He will also Chair a newly formed 
independent business, Stobart Capital, 
which will be at the heart of the Group’s 
new value creation unit (see below). 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank Andrew for his unique and tireless 
contribution to the Board and to the 
Group over the past ten years, and I 
look forward to working with Andrew 
and Warwick in their new roles.
Richard Butcher, Executive Director and 
CEO of Stobart Infrastructure, will not offer 
himself for re-election and will step down 
from the Board at the AGM. Richard’s role 
has evolved as the number of properties 
remaining in the Group portfolio has 
reduced. He will continue to manage 
the portfolio and implement the Group’s 
realisation strategy in his role as CEO 
of Stobart Infrastructure. I would like to 
thank Richard for his valued contribution 
to the Group over many years.
Mark Adams was appointed as interim 
CFO in November 2016 and has assisted 
the Group through the extension of 
the bank facility, the acquisitions of 
the airline and Propius, and the sale 
and leaseback of the Propius aircraft 
post year end. With these transactions 
now complete, Mark will step down 
from his position at 31 May 2017 and 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank him for his contribution to 
the Group. We will make a further 
announcement regarding the leadership 
of the finance function in due course.
Stobart Capital
Stobart Group has a strong track record 
of entrepreneurialism, growth and 
investment. The Group has decided to 
formally bring this expertise together 
within a new dedicated value creation 
unit, to be headed by Andrew Tinkler 
and supported by Ian Soanes, a 
long-standing advisor to the Group. 
This will enable the management 
teams of the Group’s core Energy, 
Aviation, Rail and Infrastructure 
operations to focus on driving the 
value of their existing businesses.
Stobart Capital will operate independently 
of the Group, with access to external 
capital and expertise, but working 
closely with the Group’s management 
team. Investment opportunities will 
be presented to a new Value Creation 
Board, a sub-committee of the Stobart 
Group Board, for evaluation.

Results for the Year
I am pleased to report another year 
delivering growth in both revenue and 
underlying EBITDA
1
 in spite of challenges 
due to delays in the expected operational 
date of biomass plants in the Energy 
division, and slow progress in delivering 
capacity growth at London Southend 
Airport impacted by a brief hiatus 
following the Brexit vote.
After a net non-cash goodwill write-off of 
£21.6m and other non-underlying costs of 
£13.8m, there was a loss before tax for 
the year of £8.0m.
Compounding Returns to 
Shareholders
During the year to 28 February 2017, 
£34.7m was returned to shareholders 
through dividends. The Board is 
proposing a final dividend of 4.5p (2016: 
4.0p) per ordinary share totalling £15.9m 
(2016: £13.8m paid on 8 July) and giving 
an increased total dividend payable for 
the year of 13.5p (2016: 6.0p) comprising 
of three interim dividends of 3.0p and a 
final dividend of 4.5p. We expect to 
maintain the quarterly dividend at this 
increased level. We will continue to 
support the funding of the dividend from 
proceeds of property asset disposals and 
investment realisations in the short-term 
and the Board will consider additional 
returns to shareholders should there be 
surplus funds generated.
As the Board and I look forward to the 
next 12 months, I am confident that 
Stobart’s strengths will continue to prevail 
as we all work together to achieve our 
clear objectives.
