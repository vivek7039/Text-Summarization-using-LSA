 Chairman’s Letter
Another record year
Æ Æ the refurbishment of the existing 
estate by introducing state-of-the-art 
design and installing the latest cutting 
edge screening and other technology; 
Æ Æ a consistent focus on reducing costs;
Æ Æ implementing a continuous 
programme to optimise the customer 
experience; and,
Æ Æ ensuring that we live up to our vision to 
be “The Best Place To Watch a Movie”.
I am pleased to report that these 
objectives were met during the year 
and we will continue with their 
implementation in the UK, ROW 
and US in the forthcoming year. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s 
Balance Sheet was strong with the 
Adjusted EBITDA to net debt ratio at 
1.4 times. It should be noted that this 
ratio significantly decreased in the four 
years after the Cinema City transaction, 
an achievement demonstrating the 
strong cash flows in the business and 
an ability to reduce debt, which is likely 
to have played a major part in the 
willingness of our banks to provide the 
finance and underwriting arrangements 
for the Regal transaction. 
On the strength of the Balance Sheet and 
an increase in statutory profit after tax to 
£100.6m (2016: £82.0m), the Board 
increased the cash dividend paid for the 
full year by 14.5%. The proposed final 
dividend per share is 15.4p (3.1p on a 
rights adjusted basis). 
Regal Acquisition
The acquisition of Regal completed on 
28 February 2018. Due to the size of the 
proposed acquisition it was classed as a 
reverse takeover under the Listing Rules. 
The acquisition of Regal will provide 
Cineworld with a major presence in the 
US cinema market, the largest box office 
market in the world. The North American 
box office grossed over US$11.0bn in 
2016 with annual attendance of 
approximately 1.3bn, and represented 
approximately 29% of global box office 
revenue. The US cinema market is also 
of major importance as the home to 
some of the world’s largest and most 
influential movie production studios. 
Following completion, the enlarged 
Group became a global cinema 
exhibition business of significant scale, 
with operations in ten countries covering 
an addressable market of approximately 
500m people. In the 12 months to 
30 June 2017, the enlarged Group would 
have had over 310m annual admissions, 
pro forma revenues of US$4,370m 
(£3,173m) and pro forma Adjusted 
EBITDA of US$907m (£659m). As at 
16 January 2018 the enlarged Group 
would have had 9,538 screens across 
the US and Europe, making it the 
second largest operator in the world 
(by number of screens).
The enlarged Group’s diverse 
geographic footprint will help to mitigate 
year on year volatility in the global 
cinema industry resulting from regional, 
economic, weather and movie 
performance variables and enable the 
Group to diversify its movie offerings. 
The Board believes that the enlarged 
Group will generate strong total returns 
for shareholders through top-line 
growth, delivery of operational 
improvements and dividends. 
The Regal acquisition is an ambitious 
and bold move which was very 
carefully considered by the Board 
which took a wide array of advice from 
professionals in the accounting, legal, 
strategic consultancy and environmental 
fields. We are confident that there is 
significant potential for value creation, 
Overview
2017 was an exciting year for the 
Cineworld Group – the most momentous 
since its formation in 1995. 
For the year ended 31 December 2017, 
the Group’s operations in the UK and 
ROW once again posted record results 
and then in December we announced 
the acquisition of Regal Entertainment 
Group (“Regal”) which successfully 
completed on 28 February 2018. 
Group revenue for the year increased by 
11.6% to £890.7m (2016: £797.8m), and 
Adjusted EBITDA rose to £198.2m (2016: 
£175.8m). The strong operating 
performance was driven by the 
implementation of the Group’s 
Operating Strategic Plan, adopted by 
the Executive Management Team in 2014 
after the combination with Cinema City. 
This entails: 
Æ Æ opening new cinemas in areas which 
were considered to have the potential 
to achieve double digit growth rates; 
Æ Æ the pursuit of suitable acquisition 
opportunities;
“ 2017 was an exciting 
year for the Cineworld 
Group – the most 
momentous since its 
formation in 1995”

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 and I have high expectations for the 
future of the Group. It is particularly 
gratifying that the Regal acquisition 
received strong support from our 
shareholders – 87.3% of votes cast 
were in favour of the acquisition at the 
General Meeting on 2 February 2018, 
and a 96.3% acceptance rate in respect 
of the subsequent rights issue. 
Board and Management
As a Board we take corporate 
governance standards extremely 
seriously and we always strive to attain 
the highest standards possible. We 
regularly review areas such as gender, 
diversity, health and safety and the 
environment and where appropriate 
improve our practices in those areas.
I would like to express appreciation to 
our Executive Management Team and 
all the Group employees for their 
dedication, commitment and hard work 
during the year. They are competently 
led by our CEO, Mooky Greidinger, and 
Israel Greidinger, our Deputy CEO – 
whose experience, competence and 
professionalism are recognised 
throughout the industry. Importantly 
they are substantial shareholders in the 
Company and accordingly their interests 
are fully aligned with those of all 
shareholders. Their confidence in the 
Regal acquisition was demonstrated by 
the fact that they took up all their rights 
in the rights issue by the Company.
Complementing them is a highly 
dedicated team of Senior Management 
at the Vice President level who have a 
long tenure within the Group. This deep 
experience in the industry is invaluable.
Our management and employees are 
our greatest asset and performed 
exceptionally well during the 2017 
financial year – it was a significant 
achievement to produce record results 
and at the same time to identify, 
negotiate and complete a $3.4bn 
acquisition in the US. 
The following Board changes took place 
at the start of the year:
Æ Æ Martina King, Non-Executive Director, 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
and member of the Audit Committee, 
stepped down following six years of 
service to focus on her other business 
interests. 
Æ Æ Nisan Cohen was appointed as Chief 
Financial Officer and joined the Board 
as an Executive Director. Nisan has 
been part of the Cineworld Group, 
and formerly the Cinema City Group 
for 17 years. 
Æ Æ Dean Moore, the previous interim 
Chief Financial Officer, was appointed 
to the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director, Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and a 
member of the Audit Committee. 
Dean brings over 20 years of 
experience as a plc executive director. 
The Board was satisfied that Dean 
meets the requisite criteria to be 
considered as independent, 
notwithstanding his brief ten month 
interim employment with the Group, 
during which his mandate was to 
focus primarily on the CFO 
succession planning process.
It has been a pleasure working with both 
Nisan and Dean during 2017 as they took 
on their new roles.
Outlook
As we go into 2018, I look forward with 
confidence at the prospects for the 
enlarged Group. We will have an 
excellent geographically diversified 
estate, and the movie release slate looks 
strong. We will continue to implement 
our strategic objectives in the UK and 
ROW, and begin to implement them in 
the US. We will focus on maximising 
cash flow to expand and refurbish 
our cinemas, while at the same time 
reducing borrowing levels and 
maintaining our well established 
dividend policy. I am aware that this is a 
formidable challenge but am confident 
that we have the people and resources 
to meet it.
