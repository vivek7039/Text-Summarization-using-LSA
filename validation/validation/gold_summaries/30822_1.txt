 Chief Executive’s review
intu focuses solely on regional shopping centres  
in the UK and Spain
Our performance in 2017
The underlying strengths of the intu 
business were much in evidence in 2017 
as we have recorded a robust overall 
performance, confounding the external 
gloom and negativity in pre-Brexit UK 
about retail and retail property, and 
showing the success of our asset 
management initiatives and  
strategic positioning.
Our underlying earnings per share were 
steady at 15.0 pence; we grew like-for-like 
net rental income by 0.5 per cent, within 
our original guidance 12 months ago;  
and net asset value per share, helped by  
a tremendous performance from the 
Spanish business, increased from  
404 pence to 41 1 pence.
We delivered on each of our four core 
objectives for 2017:
 — asset performance was resilient in 
the UK and buoyant in Spain, with the 
clear message from key performance 
indicators, such as lettings, occupancy, 
footfall and dwell time, that intu is in 
ﬁne shape
 — the investment programme in the UK 
moved on at pace with expenditure in 
the year of £184 million. The pipeline 
for the next three years amounts 
to £562 million, with plenty of 
opportunity beyond that date.  
In addition to the £180 million  
intu Watford extension, opening in 
2018, signiﬁcant projects are underway 
at major centres, such as intu Lakeside, 
intu Trafford Centre and intu Merry Hill
 — the awareness and importance of 
the intu brand has continued to 
grow. Five years on from launch, we 
can clearly see the advantages of a 
strong brand for a shopping centre 
business such as ours. Among these 
advantages we would include superior 
customer service, refreshing changes 
to the centres’ physical and digital 
environments and new and innovative 
sources of revenue
 — we continued to seize the growth 
opportunity in Spain. We acquired 
Madrid Xanadú in the year, a centre 
full of growth opportunities and an 
ideal ﬁt for our shopping resort model 
in Spain, with a Nickelodeon theme 
park attraction and aquarium under 
construction, to add to the existing 
indoor ski slope
Outlook and 2018 strategic objectives
The environment for the business is  
likely to remain challenging as the  
UK continues through the Brexit 
negotiations. Our shopping centres have 
not been immune to the UK’s relatively 
sluggish economic performance. 
Decision-making about investing in  
the UK has inevitably been impacted  
in the pre-Brexit period and domestic 
consumers have been adapting to 
ﬂuctuations in their discretionary 
spending capacity. 
The 2017 results are, however, a 
considerable endorsement of the 
underlying strength of the intu business 
and our strategic objectives for 2018  
build on those we have pursued in  
the last few years. They are:
 — growing like-for-like net rental income
 — optimising our ﬂagship destinations
 — delivering operational excellence
 — making smart use of capital
Front of mind for investors is the changing 
mix of online and in-store sales and how 
that might affect demand for physical 
space, hence our particular focus on the 
basic measure of growing like-for-like net 
rental income. At intu, we are still seeing 
key retailers taking more space, and 
investing for the long term in our centres, 
as they recognise the footfall we deliver 
and our ability to create more reasons  
for customers to visit and stay longer.
The underlying
strengths of the intu
business were much in
evidence in 2017 as  
shown by our robust
overall performance.”

Chief Executive
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 8 Our energies are also concentrated on 
ensuring all our centres evolve with 
consumer and retailer needs, so that they 
deliver sustainable growth. Keeping our 
centres at the forefront of people’s minds 
requires continual focus on bringing in 
new attractions, be it a key retailer or 
restaurant or a compelling leisure 
attraction. In addition to delivering our 
target return hurdles, our projects 
innovate what we offer our customers 
and keep us at the leading edge of the 
shopping centre industry.
Nowhere will this be more obvious  
than at our ground-up scheme in  
Spain, intu Costa del Sol, where we  
have the opportunity to create a world-
class centre, delivering our signature  
shopping resort product and  
showcasing our expertise.
Operational excellence is a clear 
differentiator in both the UK and Spain. 
Our knowledge and insight are important, 
as is our culture and living our values – 
bold, creative and genuine – which 
underpin everything that we do. Our 
culture is embodied by our brand which 
has become recognised throughout the 
shopping centre industry, with intu a 
byword for fantastic customer service, 
motivated and enthusiastic staff,  
expert mall operations and good 
corporate citizenship.
Our skill in this area is recognised by the 
partners we have brought into the 
business in the last few years, including 
CPPIB, LaSalle Investment Management 
and TH Real Estate. The ability to partner 
on assets allows us to astutely recycle 
and allocate capital to deliver superior 
returns. With over £800 million of cash 
and committed facilities, our ﬁnancial 
position is very sound.

Utilising technology
The retail industry has been embracing new 
technology like never before, as retailers 
increasingly see tech as a catalyst for 
creating new business opportunities,  
rather than a threat. Retailers are ﬁnding 
ingenious ways to shape their technological 
infrastructures, deﬁne their online presence 
and drive engagement with customers.
At intu, we adapted and changed our 
business model in 2013 to offer a seamless 
multichannel proposition. This year we 
began working with seven tech start-ups  
as part of intu Accelerate, our incubator 
programme, which has been trialling a 
range of new ideas in our shopping centres, 
from robotic customer services assistants 
to an online personal shopper service.
And while few new shopping centres are 
being built in the UK, we aim to be on site at 
intu Costa del Sol in Spain next year to build 
a groundbreaking shopping resort that 
takes everything we have been putting into 
practice over the last few years in the UK to 
a whole new level.

Our culture
In one way, we are a simple business,  
with a focus on creating the best shopping 
centre experience. Our culture is driven by  
a single-minded purpose to make our 
customers feel better about life through  
a visit to one of our centres.
This is an important part of the intu 
difference and a cause of our success.  
We encourage all our employees to look at 
things differently and creatively, to consider 
carefully and then act boldly and genuinely.
Strategic report
9 Chief Executive’s review Our 2018 strategy
Our results highlight the underlying strength of the intu business based on 
the strategic objectives we have pursued over the last few years. For 2018, 
we are enhancing our strategy to build on this strong base
Over the last three years, we have 
focused on four strategic objectives  
and consistently delivered against these 
with 2017 being another strong year  
of results. These objectives have seen  
us optimising our assets and growing 
like-for-like net rental income, delivering 
award-winning developments, building  
a business in Spain and maximising our  
operations through our brand. 
In Spain, we now own three top-10 
centres and are on target to begin the 
construction of intu Costa del Sol. Our 
challenge is no longer to build a business 
in Spain – we are now an established 
national player. Our brand is ﬁve years old 
and is a recognised market leader with a 
distinctive approach and clear purpose.
Knowing this, and with an eye on the 
potential challenges facing us in a 
changing market, we are tilting the 
emphasis of our objectives to increase  
our focus on the growth and continuing 
excellence of our ﬂagship destinations  
in the UK and Spain. We set out our 
objectives in more detail below.
By delivering a compelling mix of retail, catering and leisure, each  
of our ﬂagship destinations generally draws footfall of 20 million  
or more and the average customer stays for over two hours.  
We use our insight, expertise and innovation to ensure that  
they are the destinations of choice for our customers.
Priorities in 2018
 — ensure the leisure extension at intu Lakeside remains on target
 — complete the aquarium and Nickelodeon leisure attractions at 
Madrid Xanadú
 — commence the redevelopment and repositioning of Barton Square, 
further improving the tenant mix at intu Trafford Centre
 — complete the ﬁnal planning consents at intu Costa del Sol
Like-for-like net rental income growth is our key income measure.  
Given our relatively low cost base and ﬁxed ﬁnance costs, growing  
our net rental income drives earnings and ultimately dividend  
and total property return.
Priorities in 2018
 — grow like-for-like net rental income, currently expected to be in the 
range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent
 — deliver new lettings ahead of previous rent and increasing rents 
through the rent review cycle
 — reduce vacancy rate year-on-year

12 Our strategic focus going forward
Making customers smile and helping retailers ﬂourish is what we do, and 
operational excellence is how we measure our success. From a customer’s 
point of view, this is measured by our brand metrics, including net 
promoter score and brand recognition. For our retailers, it relates to 
how many customers we attract and how long they stay in our centres. 
For our wider communities, it is about being a good corporate citizen.
Priorities in 2018
 — ensure we continue to outperform footfall benchmark
 — enhance brand recognition and consistency of net promoter score
 — build on digital platform and continue to grow sales through  
the website
 — communicate, and start working towards, our 2030 corporate 
responsibility strategy
As the leading owner, developer and manager of shopping centres in  
the UK and Spain, we and our assets are well respected throughout the 
industry. This means we can access capital and attract partners to 
increase focus and achieve superior returns at our ﬂagship locations.
Priorities in 2018
 — ensure facilities available for the development pipeline – maintaining 
loan to value in the 40 to 50 per cent range 
 — continue the recycling of capital to deliver higher returns  
from developments
 — deliver ﬁnancing for the intu Costa del Sol development

Our overall business model remains unchanged. Our
