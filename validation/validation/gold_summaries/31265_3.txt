 Chairman’s statement
Roger Conant Faxon, Non-executive Chairman
number of employees increased from 74 to 91 as we continued to 
expand the Group’s technology group and started to build out our 
marketing and product teams.
We now have staff in place to serve our partners in China (Shanghai), 
Brazil (São Paulo), India (Mumbai), the United States (New York) 
and Europe (London). To build efficiency each of these offices is 
linked to provide support to each other guided by the centre 
in London. 
I would like to express the gratitude of the Board to all our staff, 
both longer serving and more recently joined, who have contributed 
to the development of the business. I have been impressed with 
their dedication and hard work while we have been putting in 
place the conditions for future growth. The demands on the team 
are unlikely to lessen as we target growth in our key markets. 
Retention and recruitment will be key to the Group’s future success. 
The Board is confident that the Company will be able to recruit 
the staff that will be needed to meet future challenges. 
Focus
The Group is putting the foundations in place now to enable 
meaningful revenue growth in the future. This requires relentless 
focus and a need to remain on strategy. Developing large enterprise 
clients takes time and patience and requires the Group to remain 
flexible in how it serves their needs while continuing to assure 
the effectiveness of our business model. 
The Board is confident that the Group can scale revenues 
by ensuring that its key customers are provided with the 
transactional tools and training needed to facilitate in‑video 
advertising. This is why the Group has spent considerable time 
and resource in developing a transactional tool which we call 
Marketplace. With relatively low levels of capital expenditure, 
the development of Marketplace and the potential to demonstrate 
the impact of in‑video advertising to broadcasters and digital 
distributors, we are confident in the Group’s ability to drive 
significant growth in the coming year and beyond. 
The Company’s first public AGM will be held on 13 June 2018.

Delivering a new advertising solution at 
 GLOBAL 
SCALE
is our purpose
I am delighted to present the first Annual Report 
and Accounts for Mirriad Advertising plc following 
the Company’s successful admission to AIM on 
19 December 2017. 
Key events 
As a result of the IPO, the Company raised net proceeds of 
£23.7 million. The fundraise has empowered the Company to 
expand the Group’s activities in its five target markets – China, 
India, the US, Brazil and Germany – the world’s largest and fastest 
growing advertising markets. 
The funds raised in the IPO allow the Group to enter 2018 
well capitalised, with a strong balance sheet enabling the Group 
to credibly demonstrate longevity to its customers, who are 
principally large digital distributors and broadcasters. The Group 
has made significant progress over the last few months since 
the IPO in rolling out its platform and technology with these 
customers which we believe will pave the way for revenue 
growth later in 2018 and beyond.
In the last quarter of 2017 the Group delivered its single biggest 
campaign. On behalf of Tangeche, a major China‑based car 
leasing firm, Mirriad embedded brand images and messages in 
over 200 episodes of video content over a five month period. 
This campaign both from its size and effectiveness is a clear 
example of the efficacy of Mirriad’s audience based model. 
The momentum has continued into the new year with the 
signing of two landmark contracts with Univision and NBCU 
in the North American market and renewing an important contract 
with Youku/Alibaba in the Chinese market. While the Group’s 
contracts do not guarantee an immediate flow of revenue 
they are critical markers of future success.
Our people 
People are our greatest asset and sit at the core of Mirriad. 
Our team of experts and specialists have developed all of our 
intellectual property, our business processes and know‑how 
that form the basis for our unique proposition. Our proprietary 
technology gives us a competitive advantage in the advertising 
industry. As a consequence the majority of the Group’s expenditure 
is on staff and staff related costs. During the year the average
