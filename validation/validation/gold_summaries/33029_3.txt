Non-Executive changes
Part of the strength of any board comes 
from refreshing and renewing the mix of 
people sitting around the boardroom table. 
When I joined the Board, I was pleased that 
both Graham Chipchase and Geneviève 
Berger also became Non-Executive 
Directors. They bring, respectively, in-depth 
ﬁnancial and scientiﬁc expertise, as well as 
signiﬁcant international business experience 
to our discussions.
Also in April 2012, we said farewell to 
Michele Hooper who stood down from  
the Board. We are all grateful for her 
distinguished contribution to our work and 
her dedicated service as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee and senior independent 
Non-Executive Director. In her place, John 
Varley took over as senior independent 
Non-Executive Director and Rudy Markham 
became Chairman of the Audit Committee.
A new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
Upon my election to the Board I was also 
appointed Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee. This enabled me to lead  
the important process of selecting David 
Brennan’s successor. This was a process 
that included both internal and external 
candidates and culminated in the 
appointment of Pascal Soriot to the Board 
as the Company’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
on 1 October. 
Pascal joined us from Roche where he had 
been serving as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer of 
the company’s pharmaceuticals division. 
His was a key appointment at an important 
time for AstraZeneca. The Board is certain 
that Pascal’s leadership qualities, combined 
with his strategic thinking and extensive 
Dear Shareholder
I am glad I was able to meet a number of 
you in April 2012 when AstraZeneca held its 
Annual General Meeting in London. At that 
meeting you elected me as a Director and  
it is my privilege to have served as your 
Chairman since June.
Louis Schweitzer and David Brennan
The day of the AGM was, by any measure, 
an historic one for your Company. It was the 
day on which David Brennan announced his 
decision to retire from AstraZeneca as your 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. It was also the day 
on which your previous Chairman, Louis 
Schweitzer, brought forward the date of his 
intended retirement to 1 June to coincide 
with that of David.
Louis had been a Director since 2004 and 
your Chairman for seven years. During that 
time he worked tirelessly to ensure that the 
Board was effective in its task of setting our 
strategy and overseeing its implementation. 
We are grateful to him for his efforts  
on your behalf.
As Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, David led 
AstraZeneca with skill, integrity and courage 
during a period of enormous change for the 
industry and for the Company in particular.  
I would like to thank David for his selﬂess 
leadership during his six years at the helm.
experience in the industry, make him  
the right person to drive AstraZeneca  
to success over the coming years. I am 
conﬁdent that Pascal’s approach and  
his track record of delivering results in 
innovation-driven businesses will be valued 
by shareholders and employees alike.
Following David’s departure, Simon Lowth 
acted as Interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.  
The Board and I would like to record our 
appreciation for his impressive leadership  
in this period. Supported by a highly 
capable and committed executive team, 
Simon maintained the organisation’s focus 
on key business priorities during a period  
of signiﬁcant change.
Sound governance
All the changes I have outlined took  
place at the same time as AstraZeneca 
completed a record number of business 
development deals. We also undertook our 
annual strategic review, in which Pascal has 
been fully involved, as well as our regular 
programme of meetings and business 
activity. That we have been able to do all  
this is a tribute both to the sound corporate 
governance processes we have in place 
and to the dedication and hard work of my 
fellow Directors. I am grateful to all of them 
for the contribution they made in 2012.
Challenging times
We will need to harness all our skills, 
capabilities and experience if we are to 
successfully navigate the current harsh 
climate for the pharmaceutical sector.  
The world pharmaceutical market is still 
growing and underlying demographic 
trends remain favourable to long-term 
industry growth. However, many of the 
drivers of demand and supply in the 
industry are under pressure.
Chairman’s 
Statement AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 7
Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
On the demand side, we face increased 
competition from generic medicines as 
some of the world’s most successful drugs 
come off patent. In addition, securing 
recognition (through reimbursement approval) 
and reward (through favourable pricing and 
sales) for innovation is becoming more 
difﬁcult in the face of intensifying pricing 
pressures, particularly in Established 
Markets facing rising healthcare costs.  
On the supply side, the industry faces an 
ongoing R&D productivity challenge. R&D 
costs have risen signiﬁcantly over the past 
decade, while industry-wide probability of 
success continues to decline.
Strategic focus
It is for the reasons outlined above that  
the outcome of our current strategic review 
is so important. Our strategy is rooted in  
our heritage as a company focused on 
innovative science to deliver great medicines 
to patients. I ﬁrmly believe that it is the  
path we need to take if we are to remain 
competitive and return to growth. That path 
must also include a commitment to the 
responsible and sustainable development  
of our business. That is why I was so 
pleased that we were once again listed in 
the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index  
in 2012 and retained our listing on the 
European Index for the ﬁfth year running.
Financial performance
We cannot hope to secure our long-term 
success if we do not meet our ﬁnancial 
targets and deliver acceptable levels of 
return to our owners. Group sales in 2012 
were down 15% to $27 ,973 million (2011: 
$33,591 million) and Reported operating 
proﬁt was down 34% at $8,148 million  
(2011: $12,795 million). Revenue in the US 
was down 21% while revenue outside the 
US was down 11%.
More than 13 percentage points of the 
revenue decline, approximately $4.5 billion, 
was related to loss of exclusivity on several 
brands in the portfolio. Seroquel IR alone 
declined by more than $3 billion, while 
regional losses of exclusivity for Atacand, 
Nexium and Crestor accounted for more 
than $1 billion. Additionally, the disposals  
of Astra Tech and Aptium accounted  
for around 1.7 percentage points of the 
decline. On the other hand, taken together, 
Symbicort, Faslodex, Onglyza, Iressa, 
Brilinta/Brilique and Seroquel XR accounted 
for more than $600 million of revenue 
growth. Additionally, our diabetes alliance 
with BMS is strengthened by the inclusion  
of the Amylin portfolio and the approval  
of Forxiga in Europe.
Reported earnings per share were down 
29% to $4.99. The decline reﬂects the  
$1.08 per share beneﬁt in 2011 from the  
sale of Astra Tech and higher restructuring 
costs in 2012.
Returns to shareholders
Consistent with our progressive dividend 
policy, the Board has recommended a 
second interim dividend of $1.90. This 
brings the dividend for the full year to  
$2.80 (178.6 pence, SEK 18.34). In 2012, 
cash distributions to shareholders through 
dividends totalled $3,665 million and net 
share repurchases totalled $2,206 million.  
In October, we announced the suspension 
of our share repurchase programme for 
2012 and the Board has decided that no 
share repurchases will take place in 2013  
in order to maintain the ﬂexibility to invest  
in the business.
Outlook
We believe challenging market conditions 
will persist in 2013, including continued 
government interventions in price. The 
revenue impact from the loss of exclusivity 
will also continue to affect our performance. 
In the context of the ongoing update to our 
strategy, we have withdrawn the planning 
assumptions for revenue and margin 
evolution for the period 2010 to 2014  
we outlined in January 2010. We plan  
to hold a Capital Markets Day in March  
2013 to provide a more detailed exposition 
of our strategic priorities.
Leif Johansson
Chairman
“  2012 financial performance was 
defined by significant revenue 
decline associated with the loss  
of exclusivity for several products. 
For 2013, challenging market 
conditions will persist.”
