DELIVERING 
TECHNOLOGY  
& PRODUCTS 
I am very pleased to report a 249.6% 
increase in profit before tax to 
£430,000 (2016: £123,000) together 
with £1.03 million cash generated from 
operations (2016: cash consumed 
£0.34 million). With the business 
now in a net cash position and with 
its technologies gaining increasing 
commercial traction, together with 
elevated political and media coverage, 
the Group has never been so well 
positioned in its key markets.

Our d
2
w oxo-biodegradable plastic technology fits in 
perfectly with many governments’ core principles of the 
3 Rs, “reduce, re-use, recycle”. However, unlike ordinary 
plastics, a plastic upgraded with d
2
w technology does 
not cause the accumulation of microplastics in the 
environment, as it converts much more rapidly into 
biodegradable materials. 
In addition to making conventional plastic more 
environmentally friendly, d
2
w can be used in some  
bio-based plastics which would not otherwise degrade 
in the open environment. This flexibility makes d
2
w a 
vital insurance policy for many types of plastics, some  
of which inevitably end up in the open environment. 
Microplastics are the main concern today, and they  
are caused by ordinary plastics fragmenting on land 
and in the oceans. They need to be urgently upgraded 
with d
2
w technology, and this is already being done 
in the Middle East, Africa and Asia – most recently in 
Saudi Arabia. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 05
Over the years we have established a strong distribution 
network with 74 distributors worldwide. In the year 
ahead one of the Company’s objectives will be to 
increase its lobbying and marketing to make sure 
that everyone understands the huge benefits that 
Symphony’s d
2
w and d
2
p technologies can bring to 
the environment and human health. Our strategy, as 
previously reported, was to expand the product range 
with synergistic technologies which can be offered to 
the same customer base, and I am pleased to report 
that this is progressing well.
Revenues for the year increased by 21.6% to £8.27 
million (2016: £6.80 million), with gross profits increasing 
by 17.8% to £4.01 million (2016: £3.41 million). The 
improved revenue was due to increased sales of d
2
w 
oxo-biodegradable plastic additives in several markets. 
These markets include South America and the Far East, 
but momentum has been most apparent in the Middle 
East, and in particular Saudi Arabia, where legislation 
requires the use of oxo-biodegradable technology for 
everyday plastic items made in or imported into the 
country. Enforcement of the legislation commenced 
during 2017.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The overall results highlight the operational gearing of 
the Group. Additionally, the Group effectively removed 
borrowings from the balance sheet as at year-end which 
was further enhanced by the completion of a capital-
reduction during the second half of the year. This, 
along with the profit generated in the year, resulted in 
a consolidated retained-earnings position of £67,000 
(2016: deficit £3.97 million). 
I would like to thank the distributors, staff and Board  
for all their hard and effective work in 2017, and we  
look forward with confidence.
