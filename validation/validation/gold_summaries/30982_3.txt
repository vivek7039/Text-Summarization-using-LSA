INTRODUCTION
2017 was an important year for Parity, one in which good
operational management created continuing
improvement despite the risk and headwinds of the
IR35 regulatory changes to the taxation of intermediaries
which oﬀered a signiﬁcant challenge to our industry.
STRATEGY
Importantly, the management team has begun further
activity to leverage the consulting services side of the
business, to drive operating margin improvement. The
Board will seek to accelerate growth in the consulting
business, whilst sustaining investment in the traditional
professional services side of the business. 
Strategically, Parity believes it has established a clear point
of diﬀerentiation from competitors due to the synergy
between its consulting and professional services divisions.
We are now highly focussed on exploiting this advantage
and we are investing in key hires to optimise the
opportunities which we believe exist. We also believe that
a focus on Data Management, which we ﬁrst identiﬁed as
an opportunity 18 months ago, now has the potential to
become a leading oﬀering for the Group in 2018.
RESULTS 
It has been particularly pleasing in 2017 to see strong
customer relationship management lead to a 73% increase
in proﬁt before tax to £1.66m (2016: £0.96m). This was
further leveraged by strong working capital management,
with Group debtor days at a record low of 20 days (2016:
29 days). As a result of strong cash generation, we were
able to reduce net debt substantially to £1.6m at 31
December 2017 (2016: £4.4m), whilst also investing for
future growth.
Key relationships held by the business for many years such
as the Education and Skills Funding Agency, British
American Tobacco and the Ministry of Defence, continued
to widen and deepen, and we were able to announce post-
close extensions on these contracts. New clients have
been developed such as Primark, the high street retailer,
and this together with the combination of good
relationship management and increasing traction from
new relationships underpin the outlook for 2018.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The ﬁnal legacy from the previous strategy is the Group’s
bespoke 3D development arm, Inition which has for some
time been a non-core asset. It has been held for sale and
accounted for as a discontinued operation in these
accounts. Despite having good skills and some speciﬁc
successes, the business had a disappointing year in 2017
due to its lack of scale and lack of synergy with the rest of
the Group. Following a diligent process, the Board remains
optimistic of a sale of the business to a home where a
greater synergy can be achieved, and will keep this plan
under review. 
DIVIDEND
The Board will not declare a dividend at this time but looks
forward to restoring a dividend in the medium term.
PEOPLE
We would like to thank the wider team across Parity for
all their hard work and commitment in helping the
management team drive the business forward. It is a
testament to this hard work that we have been able to
make such strong progress with our strategy and achieve
such a robust performance despite considerable change. 
BOARD
As ﬁrst announced on 23 March 2017, I joined the Board
as Group Non-Executive Chairman on 27 April 2017,
replacing Lord Freeman.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
Trading in the current ﬁnancial year remains in line with
expectations and the Board remains conﬁdent in the
outlook and continues to target investment to support
strategic progress. We believe our continued drive to
rebalance revenues towards the higher margin consulting
arm of the business positions us well to deliver both
growth and further improvements in proﬁtability in 2018
and beyond.
