 Chief Executive’s review
Our strategy  
is delivering  
strong results
Helen Gordon
Chief Executive
Dear shareholders,
It is my second year at Grainger, and I am pleased to report 
strong performance of your Company, and good progress  
on our strategy.
We continue to grow rents, simplify and focus the business to 
reposition it for the future, and build on our significant 105-year 
experience in the UK residential market. 
Less than two years ago, we set out a plan to refocus the 
Company on investment in the UK private rented sector, and to 
grow significantly by investing £850m into the UK PRS by 2020.  
Our vision for the business is simple – to be the UK’s best PRS 
landlord and deliver attractive total returns for our shareholders.   
Strategic priority 1: grow rents
We have secured more than 75% of our targeted investment,  
and we anticipate superior returns of typically between 6.5%  
and 8% gross yields from our investments.
When we have deployed the £850m and our investments are 
fully stabilised, we expect net rental income to be more than 
double what it was in 2015.
Strategic priority 2: simplify and focus
In parallel with this growth, we have also delivered on our 
promise to improve Grainger’s efficiency and reduce operating 
costs. Our overheads are 25% lower than in 2015 and we have 
significantly reduced our cost of debt, which now stands at 3.4%. 
We have reduced the cost of running our properties, with gross  
to net leakage reduced to 26%. We have also substantially 
enhanced our capital structure, processes, governance and 
control environment, and we have repositioned Grainger to 
support our strategy for growth. 
Strategic priority 3: build on our experience 
We continue to build on our reputation as a leading residential 
landlord in the UK and remain focused on providing great rental 
homes and continually improving our customer service. We are 
enhancing the service we can provide our customers through 
operational improvements and through investing in technology. 
Our commitment to the health and safety of our customers and 
employees remains central to what we do.

Delivering results
Strong financial performance
As a result of the significant changes we have implemented 
within the business over the last two years, I’m pleased to report 
that the financial performance of the Company is strong. 
Adjusted earnings increased by 40% in the year to £74.4m.  
We have grown net rental income by 8% to £40.4m, delivered 
strong sales performance from our regulated tenancy portfolio 
and created enhanced profits from development activity. In 
addition, we have made great strides in improving our capital 
structure with a cost of debt of 3.4% at the period end. The total 
return for the year was 7 .3%, a strong result, supported by an 
enhanced income return and a lower level of capital growth than 
last year. Last financial year also benefited from the profitable 
disposals of our non-core businesses (FY16: 10.6%). 
I am pleased to report an 8% increase in our total dividend to 
4.86p per share (FY16: 4.50p per share), in line with our policy  
to deliver sustainable, income backed growth and distribute 50% 
of net rental income. (See the Financial review on pages 24 to 28).
Superior operational performance
Underpinning our financial performance is the progress we  
have made on improving the management of our portfolio  
and our increased focus on customer service. To support this 
crucial aspect of the business, we recruited John Kenny as  
Chief Operating Officer. From his previous role operating 
approximately 25k student beds, John brings a wealth of 
experience and knowledge.
Over the year, the performance in our net rental income was 
supported by a reduction in our property operating costs  
(gross to net leakage) from 28% to 26%. Meanwhile, we 
successfully increased the length of stay of our customers from 
less than 18 months to over 2 years, reducing void costs whilst 
also capturing strong rental growth.
Recognition as a market leader
We were proud to be acknowledged for our position as the 
industry’s leading PRS landlord, asset manager and developer. 
We are also grateful to our peers for awarding us Property 
Week’s Property Company of the Year, a highly competitive  
and cross-sector award. Our GRIP REIT joint venture with APG 
was recognised as a Sector Leader by the Global Real Estate 
Sustainability Benchmark.
Our differentiated approach
We refined our operating model during the year. Our success  
is based on our ability to originate, invest and operate our 
investments fully in-house, and we have organised the business 
to provide a strong focus on each area.
This enables us to generate superior returns through our ability 
to collaborate internally across all these areas. In this regard,  
we strongly believe that the whole is greater than the sum  
of its parts. The operational team, for example, works with our 
development team in the design of our new PRS developments, 
and with the investment team to appraise every opportunity we 
consider. This collaborative and informed approach produces 
enhanced returns and reduces risks.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Preparing the business for the exciting growth  
in new PRS homes 
As our pipeline of new PRS homes grows, we are investing to 
support future growth. We examined every process within the 
business to find more efficient ways of working, and through  
a great team effort and a disciplined focus on continuous 
improvement we have laid excellent foundations for the future.
Last year, we completed a full strategic review of the business, 
covering every portfolio and its potential for growth. We 
continue to regularly review all of the assets within our portfolio 
and measure their returns potential. This has led to a series of 
profitable disposals, enhancing our sales revenues. The Board 
and the whole Grainger team are committed to this disciplined 
and continual approach to evaluating assets.
Securing a high-quality pipeline
We strengthened our acquisition team during the year by 
investing in our in-house research capability and improved our 
investment process to ensure it is both robust and efficient.  
The result is a team focused on identifying opportunities with  
the right characteristics for growth, in the right locations, and we 
have successfully secured a number of high-quality investments. 
Customer focus
We continue to look at ways we can improve our service to 
customers. Our annual customer survey and the regular 
feedback we collect provide us with a clear set of priorities 
against which to measure our service and focus our attention.
In our portfolio of regulated properties, we recognise that many 
of our residents are older. We are working with Age UK London  
to help us understand how we can better support our older 
residents. We have also supported the Grainger team with 
technology, enabling them to work remotely and get closer  
to our regulated tenancy customers.
We have made a number of improvements in the way we support 
our PRS customers and we undertook a survey to understand 
what else we could improve upon and to better understand our 
customers’ preferences in the PRS. The survey identified that 
there is scope to improve on our responsiveness and reduce  
the time to resolve maintenance requests. To this end, we are 
investing in technology solutions and our people. This is an 
important area for the Grainger team, and one our investment  
in technology will support.

Chief Executive’s review continued
Attracting and retaining the best talent
Despite the change that has taken place over the past two years, 
I am proud to say that the Grainger team remains as enthusiastic 
as ever. The talent within the organisation is unrivalled, we are 
committed to attracting and retaining the best talent and we 
have a rigorous framework for doing so. We are committed to 
encouraging a positive working culture with a focus on customer 
service and continuous improvement.
Our employee engagement survey highlighted the high levels  
of pride that employees have in Grainger. Levels of staff 
engagement are high, with 87 .5% of staff responding to the 
survey. The survey also identified areas where we can do more  
to support and develop our staff including ‘wellbeing’ and  
‘giving something back’, and we are planning a series of  
initiatives for 2018. 
Making a positive impact
To help secure a long and successful future for Grainger, we 
believe it is important that we make a positive impact, both  
on those around us and the environment. We have therefore 
developed a new corporate social responsibility and sustainability 
strategy which has three focus areas: treating people positively; 
creating desirable, healthy homes; and securing our future  
(see pages 29 to 35).
A positive market backdrop
The fundamental market drivers for the UK PRS remain positive 
and demand for good-quality rental homes far outstrips supply. 
Growth in demand is projected to continue. While political 
uncertainty and Brexit are having an impact on real estate 
generally, the UK PRS is proving resilient. The legislative 
environment across the UK and in London supports growth  
in the UK PRS, particularly through build-to-rent and  
institutional investment.
Looking ahead
Through implementation of Grainger’s strategy and a focus  
on creating great homes for rent, the business has been 
transformed. The work we have done to dramatically improve  
our cost base and invest in a pipeline of quality assets positions 
us for strong growth. Much work remains, however, and we 
intend to maintain our rigour and pace. 
Our longer-term vision for the business goes beyond our £850m 
investment plan, and we have redesigned the business to support 
further growth, both financially and operationally. 
We are looking to introduce technology solutions to further 
improve our operations, generate enhanced returns and  
continue to improve our customer service.
Our focus today remains on fully securing our pipeline of 
high-quality rental homes that will produce attractive and 
enduring returns. 
I would like to thank the Grainger team for their continued hard 
work and dedication to achieving such a great performance this 
year. Our Property Director, Nick Jopling, leaves Grainger at the 
end of 2017 . I would like to thank Nick for his contribution to  
the business over the last seven years, and particularly for the 
support he has given me over the last two years. I would like  
to thank our previous Chairman Baroness Margaret Ford for her 
unwavering support of the executive team and our new strategy. 
I would also like to thank the Board and our shareholders for their 
ongoing support.
The future for Grainger is exciting. We are growing a business 
with great long-term value, and we are delivering a portfolio  
of good-quality homes for rent which our employees and 
shareholders can be proud of.
