Carl Cavers
Chief Executive Officer
Introduction
This is my first statement as CEO of Sumo Group plc and 
it gives me great pleasure to update our shareholders on 
what has been a momentous year for the Group. 
In June 2018 we will celebrate the 15th anniversary of 
the foundation of Sumo Digital. The business has grown 
consistently throughout its history and it is now one of 
Europe’s largest independent video games developers. 
In June 2017 we acquired Atomhawk Design Limited, a multi 
award-winning visual design company, servicing the games, 
film and visual effects industries. This acquisition expanded 
our integrated video game service offering and strengthens 
the Group's position in offering premium services to 
our clients. 
Just prior to the close of the financial year, the Group 
achieved one of its key strategic ambitions and, following 
a successful IPO, was admitted to the London Stock 
Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on 
21 December 2017. Having been through three changes 
of ownership in the last three years, we are looking forward 
to the stability that this platform brings and the opportunity 
to focus wholly on the development of the business. Sumo 
Group is a people business offering premium video game 
development services to its clients. Following the IPO, we 
have a strong balance sheet and a structure with which we 
can incentivise our people, as we continue to drive growth 
in the business. 
We entered 2017 with 382 people operating from three 
locations in two countries. The year concluded with Sumo 
Group plc employing 489 people operating at five locations 
in three countries. Post year end, the Group extended its 
operations further when it took over the Newcastle studio 
of CCP Games, bringing a further 34 people to the business 
and an additional studio location.
Joining AIM is a significant step forward 
in Sumo Group's journey to becoming a 
global leader in premium development and 
creative services to the video game and 
wider entertainment industries. We had an 
overwhelmingly positive response to the 
Placing and, on behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all our investors for their support and 
our advisers for helping us make this happen.

SNAKE PASS TAKES HOME 
THE AWARD FOR BEST ARCADE 
GAME AT THE TIGA AWARDS
A unique, physics-based puzzle platform 
game, Snake Pass challenges players to 
‘think like a snake’ as they tackle precarious 
puzzles as only a snake can. Slither through 
long grass, coil around bamboo and climb 
out of trouble in the latest game from award 
winning independent studio Sumo Digital.
The winner of Sumo Digital’s inaugural 
Game Jam, Snake Pass was created 
by Seb Liese as a love-letter to both the 
favourite games of his youth and his 
childhood pet snake.
After winning, a full demo was produced 
and taken around various public shows 
where it was met with great enthusiasm 
by gamers of all ages.
Buoyed by its success, full production 
began when the team returned home 
to Sumo HQ.
We acquired an additional 11,000 sq ft of office 
space in Sheffield during the year and began 
a significant refurbishment programme in 
September 2017 to provide a larger and better 
working environment for our people. This work 
is ongoing and completion is expected shortly. 
We also acquired a further 2,700 sq ft of space 
in Nottingham in May 2017, which gives us the 
capacity to deliver headcount growth, although 
we are constantly reviewing opportunities to 
accelerate growth by opening studios in other 
key locations.
In January 2017, Sumo Digital celebrated ten 
years of operating in India. Our India studio was 
founded to provide additional skilled resources. 
Pune offered an appealing cost base to help 
underpin EBITDA performance. This part of 
the business has grown consistently since its 
foundation, relocating to larger premises in 
December 2016, which allows for growth in line 
with our other territories. This studio continues 
to perform strongly.
It is always pleasing when a business’ 
strengths are recognised externally. In January 
2017, Sumo Digital was awarded a 1 star 
rating in the Best Companies™ Survey. This 
accreditation demonstrates “very good levels 
of workplace engagement”. We shall continue 
to strive for excellence and the associated 3 
star rating. In November, Sumo Digital’s first 
revenue generating own-IP game, Snake Pass, 
won the industry accolade of Best Arcade 
Game at the much coveted TIGA Awards. 
TIGA is The Independent Game Developers’ 
Association, a network for games developers 
and digital publishers and a trade association 
representing the video games industry. 
Throughout the year under review, Sumo 
Digital continued to work with some of the 
largest publishers in the world. Over the 
past few years, we have worked with Sony, 
Microsoft, Sega, Deep Silver, IO Interactive 
and CCP Games, who announced their co-
development relationship with Sumo Digital 
in October 2017.
Sumo Digital remains focused on investing in 
its key relationships to develop and deliver high 
quality video games, while maintaining a high 
level of staff utilisation: in excess of 95% in the 
UK over recent years. This proven model gives 
Sumo Digital high quality and visible earnings. 
During the year, the shift towards more 
royalty arrangements as part of our contracts 
continued. We are always keen to align our 
interests with those of our clients and see the 
opportunity for financial out-performance on 
new iterations of proven games.
Atomhawk Design
Atomhawk Design Limited was acquired 
on 29 June 2017, at which time it was 
operating from a single studio in Newcastle. 
We announced the opening of Atomhawk’s 
new Vancouver studio in September and, 
in February 2018 the team moved to larger 
premises in the city.
This business provides visual development 
(concept art) and marketing art, as well as 
motion graphics and user interface design. 
Its expertise is in helping customers define a 
visual look for their products, from inception 
through development and, at the final point of 
sale, through marketing imagery, videos and 
box packaging design. Atomhawk primarily 
serves the creative industries, working 
with video games studios, as well as in 
film and television.
Results
In the year ended 31 December 2017, revenue 
rose by 27% to £30.6m (unaudited pro forma 
2016: £24.1m). This was driven by continuing 
strong organic growth at Sumo Digital, the 
release of its first own IP title, Snake Pass, and 
the acquisition of Atomhawk, which contributed 
revenue of £1.3m in the six months following 
its acquisition on 29 June 2017. Development 
fees for the year were £28.4m (unaudited pro 
forma 2016: £23.8m), an increase of 19.5% 
on the prior year and an increase of 33.5% on 
a like for like basis excluding pass-through 
revenue. The Group generated own intellectual 
property title revenue for the first time in 2017 
of £1.7m (2016: nil) and royalty income was 
£0.5m (unaudited pro forma 2016: £0.3m). 
Gross profit for the year was £13.3m 
(unaudited pro forma 2016: £9.0m), an increase 
of 47.2% on the prior year, and we achieved a 
gross margin of 43.3% (unaudited pro forma 
2016: 37.4%).
The Group achieved Adjusted EBITDA
1
 of 
£8.4m in 2017, a substantial increase on the 
unaudited pro forma £6.0m reported in 2016. 
Cash flow was strong during the year with cash 
generated from operations of £3.3m (unaudited 
pro forma 2016: £3.3m). Cash balances at the 
year end were £12.4m, following the repayment 
of bank and shareholder debt with the 
proceeds of the IPO. 
Further details of the Group’s financial results 
including the non-cash cost arising on the 
amortisation of intangible assets are set 
out in the Chief Financial Officer’s Review, 
which follows.
Operational review
Sumo Digital
Sumo Digital, the Group’s largest business 
representing 96% of revenue, is a developer 
of AAA-rated video games, providing both 
turnkey and co-development solutions to an 
international blue-chip client base. Its full-
service development solution includes initial 
concept and pre-production, production and 
development and post release support. 
Following the post year end takeover of 
CCP’s Newcastle studio on 1 January 2018, 
the business now operates from studios in 
Sheffield, Nottingham, Newcastle and Pune 
in India.
1 Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit before finance 
 costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items, 
 is a non GAAP metric used by management and is not an 
 IFRS disclosure. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 12
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
OUR BUSINESS MODEL 
AND STRATEGY 
Sumo Digital’s core strategy is 
to continue to grow organically as 
one of the leading co-developers 
of AA/AAA-rated gaming titles in the 
world, primarily using its contracted 
development fee model to minimise 
risk, and taking advantage of the 
forecast growth in the global 
gaming market.
Lower risk co-development 
operating model
Sumo Digital operates a lower risk contracting 
model than the majority of other developers 
and publishers who are more exposed to the 
commercial success or failure of the game. 
The Directors believe these long-term 
contracts de-risk the Group’s model by 
securing that payment is made in accordance 
with the achievement of a number of key 
milestones, during and following release  
of the game which are agreed prior to the 
start of the project, rather than on completion 
and/or sales performance.
Deliver and expand
•  Well placed to deliver significant growth 
through developing new franchise titles 
as the demand for creative content 
continues to grow;
•  Develop downloadable content for 
existing titles that can be used to extend 
further the revenue generating capability 
of games for publishers; and
•  Continue to recruit, retain, incentivise 
and develop the Group’s talent pool 
in order to increase the Group’s core 
development capacity and capability.
New strategic partners
•  Continue to win new clients and extend 
the Group's publisher portfolio;
•  Collaboration with other co-developers 
and extending existing co-development 
relationships; and
•  Potential to open or acquire new studios 
to enable recruitment from further 
pools of talent and gain exposure to new 
publishers and game genres.
Atomhawk has been involved in the creation 
of many high profile projects, including the 
movies Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor II and 
Avengers II, as well as the games Mortal 
Kombat, Injustice, RYSE and Killzone. 
Atomhawk also provides creative design and 
content for J.K. Rowling’s Pottermore and is a 
regular creative vendor for global brands such 
as Lego, Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, Marvel and 
Warner Bros.
Atomhawk’s customers include a number 
of high profile video game developers, movie 
studios and product designers, including 
NetherRealm Studios, CCP, Rebellion, Deep 
Silver, Rock Steady Studios, Square Enix, Ninja 
Theory, BBC, Rare and Ubisoft.
Atomhawk delivered a strong performance 
in the six months to 31 December 2017, well 
ahead of the Board’s original expectations at 
the time of acquisition.
Strategy
There are four parts to Sumo Group’s strategy: 
to deliver and expand, to win new clients, 
to add complementary revenue streams and 
to develop our own IP .
•  We plan to deliver and expand by developing 
subsequent franchise titles, by developing 
downloadable content, managing online 
communities (collectively referred to as 
‘games as a service’) and generating 
royalties, where our interests are clearly 
aligned with our clients; 
•  We plan to win new clients through the 
expansion of our publisher portfolio, 
collaborating with other developers and 
extending our co-development relationships, 
and also through selective acquisitions; 
•  We seek to develop complementary revenue 
streams through moving into new premium 
services, possibly through acquisition, as we 
have successfully done with Atomhawk; and 
•  Following the highly successful release 
of Snake Pass in 2017, we will continue 
to develop our own-IP through applying 
AAA mentality to indie games, although no 
releases are planned in 2018. It is important 
to emphasise that own-IP is expected to 
remain a relatively small part of the Group’s 
overall activities. It is, however, a useful 
activity that provides an additional, creative 
outlet for our highly talented people, 
while generating a significant return on 
investment. In 2017, Snake Pass received 
critical acclaim and became No.1 on the 
Nintendo e-shop charts in Europe.
Acquisitions
We are very pleased with Atomhawk, which 
performed strongly in the six months following 
its acquisition. This was the first acquisition 
completed by Sumo Digital and has provided a 
useful template for future acquisitions which 
complement Sumo Digital’s proven organic 
growth model. 
The Board is particularly keen to acquire 
owner-managed businesses, where the 
vendors remain with the business post 
acquisition and where we can use our quoted 
share structure to provide suitable ongoing 
incentive arrangements.
The IPO
We were delighted to achieve a successful 
IPO and join AIM in December 2017. This was 
a longstanding objective and an important 
milestone in the development of Sumo Group. 
The management team holds a significant 
shareholding in the business and I am 
grateful to our people and our advisers, 
who worked so hard to make the IPO happen, 
and also to Perwyn and our new investors  
for their support.
People
Sumo Group is a people business and we 
are investing in our people and will continue 
to do so. This investment includes recruiting 
new joiners and incentivising our staff. 
During the year, our headcount increased 
by 107, appointing new people in each of our 
operating locations. The management team 
was strengthened to address our market 
opportunities and to prepare for the IPO. 
New roles were created, including Portfolio 
Director, Senior Development Director and 
General Counsel & Company Secretary. 
Own intellectual property
•  Following the successful launch of 
Snake Pass, which has generated a 
return on investment in excess of 83% 
since launch, the Directors intend to 
continue to operate Group-wide Game 
Jams and selectively develop ‘Indie 
Games’.
Acquisition of complementary 
revenue streams
•  Consider earnings enhancing 
acquisitions of premium video game 
service providers and complementary 
video game developers. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 13
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
MARKET DRIVERS 
Shift to digital 
The proliferation of online distribution 
platforms has resulted in significant growth 
in the sale of digitally distributed games. 
Historically, games have been sold through 
physical retail channels. An increase in digital 
downloads has resulted in a reduced cost of 
distribution, greater ease of self-publishing 
and promotion, the potential for dynamic 
pricing and the potential for games to move 
from a product to a service. A ‘games-as-a-
service’ role allows us to extend the lifespan 
and revenue generation of a game title.
Embedded user base
Historically, there has been a clearly defined 
console hardware cycle, which in turn defined 
the software cycle. Third party publishers 
would wait for the market to be in a favourable 
position before investing in software. Gamers 
would also be less inclined to purchase 
new games at the end of one console’s life 
cycle. The current installed console base has 
seen an increase in the ability to play games 
from previous generation consoles on new 
generation consoles.  
This increased backward compatibility has 
substantial benefits for developers and 
provides the opportunity for constant mass 
market penetration.
Geographic expansion
The video games market is benefiting from 
global emerging markets. In China, the sale 
of games consoles was banned in 2000 but 
the ban was lifted in January 2014. There 
is also huge potential demand from South 
America (+15% CAGR for retail sales,  
FY16-21), the fastest of all geographies.¹ 
Broadening demographics
The age demographics of video gamers 
continues to broaden. Consumers remain 
engaged past adolescence due to continued 
innovation. Video games attract a wide mix 
of consumers, who are typically ‘sticky’ over 
time. The current average video game player 
is 35 years old. The video games market has 
also become non-gender specific with over 
40% being female gamers.² 
We expect to continue 
our organic growth and 
are also keen to acquire 
suitable, complementary 
businesses. My Board 
colleagues and I are 
confident about the 
outlook for the Group 
in the year ahead.
Since IPO, we have taken steps to incentivise 
our staff, which include providing opportunities 
to participate in our newly listed equity, and 
we are investing in our premises to provide a 
quality working environment.
It was pleasing for Darren Mills, a co-founder 
of Sumo Digital, and me to feature in Games 
Industry.biz’s Top 100 Most Influential in 2017 
and I was particularly gratified to receive an 
honorary doctorate from Sheffield Hallam 
University. Sheffield is a burgeoning tech hub 
in the UK and we take our local heritage 
very seriously.
I would like to extend my personal thanks and 
appreciation to all our people for their hard 
work in 2017. In August, we had our regular 
Sumo Big Day Out, which is a celebration event 
for all the families involved with making Sumo 
great! I am already looking forward to our next 
Big Day Out this coming summer .
The market 
2017 lived up to expectations, proving to be 
a productive year for video game developers 
and publishers. The launch of the Nintendo 
Switch
TM
 and Microsoft’s Xbox One X 
demonstrated the buoyancy of the premium 
console market and demand for premium 
content on these devices reached an all-time 
high. Xbox One X, the third release of new 
hardware under the Xbox One name, confirms 
Microsoft’s commitment to iterative hardware. 
Nintendo Switch
TM
 has proved to be a prime 
target for ‘indie developers’. 25 of the Top 30
1
 
most downloaded titles were developed by 
‘Indies’. Sumo Digital directly benefited from 
this platform, being rewarded with a No.1 for 
Snake Pass on Nintendo Europe’s eShop.
2017 was also the first full year of sales for 
Sony’s Playstation® VR, for which Sumo 
Newcastle, under its previous owners CCP 
Games, saw the release of their critically 
acclaimed title “Eve Valkyrie”. Sumo Digital 
is well positioned to pursue opportunities 
in this space as the installed base grows to 
what will eventually become a mass-market 
proposition. Another exciting platform for 
Sumo Digital is Esports, where we were part 
of the team that developed Forza Motorsport 
in 2017. 
With the global video games market worth 
over $113bn in 2017 (up c.8% on 2016) with 
a forecast CAGR of c. 8% to 2021
2
, this is 
an exciting time to be providing video game 
development services. 
Outlook
The new financial year ending 31 December 
2018 has started strongly. Whilst it is still early 
in the year, the Board already expects to deliver 
results slightly ahead of market expectations. 
We are continuing to see strong demand 
for the Group’s services and we are well 
placed to take advantage of the considerable 
opportunities. Those of us who were at GDC 
(Game Developers Conference) in March 
2018 saw at first hand the strength of growth 
in our chosen markets, with the associated 
opportunities this brings, and the Group’s 
business development pipeline reflects this.
We expect to continue our organic growth and 
are also keen to accelerate this by acquiring 
suitable, complementary businesses. My 
Board colleagues and I are confident about 
the outlook for the Group in the year ahead.
