Chairman’s Statement
Our Assets Under Management (AUM) increased 27% 
over the year in Sterling terms from £7.3bn to £9.3bn 
and 12% in Dollar terms from $10.4bn to $11.6bn. The 
increase in AUM was due entirely to market and currency 
movement as it was another year of net outflows from our 
funds. The level of net outflows of £230m was however 
markedly lower than last year and over the second half of 
the year we returned to net inflows.
Stock markets around the world were surprisingly buoyant 
over the period although this was not reflected in flows 
into active equity funds as it was another challenging year 
for the industry with passive products continuing to take 
market share. Across Europe active equity funds suffered 
net outflows of €60bn and in the UK it was the worst year 
for retail fund flows for over 20 years!
In this context our reducing levels of net outflows provide 
grounds for encouragement.
Funds and Performance
Despite the very challenging industry conditions eight 
of our twelve strategies recorded positive net inflows 
over the financial year. The four strategies that suffered 
outflows were Japan, GEMS and North America on the 
long-only side and European Long/Short on the absolute 
return side.
Although the main Japan UCITS fund experienced 
further substantial outflows, it is pleasing to see a sharp 
improvement in the fund’s performance over the last 
twelve months as the team’s style has returned to favour. 
We again suffered redemptions from our GEMS funds 
following a sustained period of lacklustre performance 
although the longer-term performance of the GEMS 
Income fund remains impressive. The outflows on our 
North America fund were due to short-term client tactical 
allocation decisions away from the US market rather than 
relating to fund performance, which continues to be 
strong and well ahead of benchmark over most periods 
and since launch.
On the alternatives side we have continued to see 
redemptions on our European Long/Short products in 
reaction to several years of below target returns. The 
team’s fundamental bottom up value style has been 
challenged over recent years and the distortions in the 
European market as a result of the ECB’s extensive QE 
program have certainly proved unhelpful. However, there 
are signs that market conditions are ‘normalising’ and 
the team’s flagship Forager fund has rebounded sharply 
through the end of May, giving us encouragement that 
the worst may well be behind the team and their funds. 
Of the eight strategies that experienced net inflows we 
saw particularly good interest in Technology, Healthcare, 
Financials and European Income (ex UK) on the long-only 
side and on the alternative side Global Convertibles and 
UK Absolute had meaningful inflows.
In the March quarter of the year inflows were helped 
further by the successful launch of our long-only UK 
Value Opportunities UCITS fund managed by Georgina 
Hamilton which raised over £100m at launch. George 
Godber was able to join us in April and be reunited with 
Georgina as co-manager on the fund and momentum 
has continued to be strong with assets at the end of  
May over £256m.
The poor performance of active managers in general 
against their benchmarks in 2016 and that of many of 
our own managers too, is reflected in the low level of 
performance fees we received last year which came in 
well below our expectations. This was though the 16th 
successive year of earning performance fees.
Results
Pre-tax profits fell to £20.4m from £23.6m in the prior 
year. Core pre-tax profits fell from £23.6m to £21.8m and 
net performance fees decreased from £3.0m to £1.2m.
Adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share fell from 
22.0p to 20.4p.
Our balance sheet remains strong with net assets of 
£70.7m (2016: £75.7m) including net cash of £58.5m 
(2016: £48.8m). Strategic Report

Market Background
‘Markets climb a wall of worry’ goes the old adage and 
surely that has never been truer than last year. First we 
had the run up to the Brexit vote in June which created 
a degree of uncertainty in the UK and then the vote 
itself which proved a surprise to many and certainly 
to most stock market investors. Worries over the 
implications for the UK economy were quickly followed 
by worries over the US presidential election which 
produced another result to confound the pollsters, 
political commentators and most investors.
The European political situation has been another area of 
constant worry as has been North Korea, the Middle East 
and the South China Sea where tensions between China 
and many of its neighbours over rights and claims continue 
to simmer. Investors even had to contend with a rise in US 
interest rates – the first increase since the financial crisis 
of 2008. Despite all these worries returns on major stock 
markets around the world proved remarkably strong and 
particularly so for the sterling based investor.
The global economy proved itself oblivious to all the 
political turmoil growing steadily through calendar 2016 
and through the opening months of 2017. Even Europe 
is showing signs of a broad based improvement in 
economic activity. Earnings at many companies have thus 
proved remarkably resilient in the face of all the political 
drama and with many corporates awash with cash, 
corporate takeover activity has continued at a high level. 
The overall earnings outlook has been further boosted by 
improvement in the outlook for financials, commodities 
and energy – all important sectors that have experienced 
their challenges over recent years. 
In the UK, the FTSE 100 Index returned 23.3% over 
the year with many of the large companies in the Index 
benefitting from a weak pound boosting their overseas 
earnings. The broader based FTSE All Share Index still 
managed a healthy return of 22% even though many 
of the smaller companies within the Index were initially 
most impacted by the Brexit vote and the implications for 
the UK economy. 
The strong consensus of economists and politicians 
and indeed many investors post the Brexit result was 
for an immediate and sharp slowdown in the domestic 
economy. The reality so far has rather confounded the 
consensus. Nevertheless the Brexit negotiations are an 
immense challenge and will create much uncertainty in 
the coming months and years.
Outside of the UK, returns around the world were also 
strong with the S&P500 Index in the US up 17% and the 
NASDAQ up 23% – for the Sterling investor these translated 
into even greater returns of 34% and 41% respectively. 
The EURO STOXX 50 posted a 21% return in Euros but in 
sterling this was nearly 31% and whilst the Japanese Topix 
returned a rather pedestrian 15% by comparison, translated 
into sterling this became a heady 33%. 
Awards
A good number of our funds and fund managers 
received awards again this year with the Insurance 
fund, part of our Financials team, receiving a total of 
six awards. There were multiple awards also for our 
Technology and Healthcare teams as well awards for 
the Japan and North America teams.
At a company level we received awards from Investment 
Week at their Specialist Awards 2016 and from 
International Adviser for product and service.
Dividend
As previously stated the Board believes that the level of 
dividend should reflect the Company’s trading results, its 
cash resources and also its future prospects.
With the outlook improving as we enter the new financial 
year and supported by our very strong balance sheet, the 
Board has decided to once again pay an uncovered dividend 
and to maintain the second interim dividend at 19.5p.

Leadership Changes
On behalf of the other Board members and the entire staff 
at Polar, I would like to thank Tim Woolley, co-founder of 
the business, who will be standing down as Chief Executive 
in July, for his leadership in so successfully guiding us 
through many challenges over the past seven and a half 
years. Since Tim has been CEO, the Group has added 
eight new investment teams, head count has increased 
from 52 to 114, and AUM has increased from $1.9bn to 
$12.6bn. This has been a tremendous achievement not only 
when considered against the back drop of seismic changes 
in geopolitics and regulation, market crises, and shifting 
trends in the asset management industry that have occurred 
during his tenure, but also when one considers that growth 
and success have come whilst retaining the entrepreneurial, 
collegiate and transparent environment that Polar offers 
its fund managers and staff. Fortunately our association 
will continue as Tim will be staying on as a non-executive 
member of the Board.
I am looking forward to welcoming Gavin Rochussen on 
board as our new Chief Executive in July. Gavin has an 
exceptional record as a CEO in the asset management 
industry and has a proven record in developing an 
institutional business and building a significant presence 
in North America. 
We look forward to a bright future under his proven  
and dynamic leadership.
Annual General Meeting
Once again our AGM will be held at our offices at  
16 Palace Street, London, SW1E 5JD. The meeting will be  
on the 26 July 2017 commencing at 2:30pm. Although we 
do not give a trading update at the meeting, I encourage 
shareholders to attend so that they can meet the Directors 
after the meeting.
Outlook
Whilst political uncertainty and market-volatility appear 
to be our constant travelling companions these days, 
we enter the new fiscal year with a good degree of 
momentum in terms of fund performance, fund flows 
and asset growth. 
Despite ongoing regulatory headwinds within the 
industry, we believe we are well positioned to return 
to earnings growth in the new financial year subject to 
there being no major correction in markets.
