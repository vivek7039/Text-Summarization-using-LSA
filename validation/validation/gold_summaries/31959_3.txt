CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Delivering Value for 
All Shareholders
2017 has been a transformative year for Bowleven,  
both in terms of its Board and its operating model.
Responding to Shareholders
Crown Ocean Capital P1 Limited (‘Crown Ocean’), 
then and now a major shareholder of the Company, 
approached Eli Chahin and myself around the turn of 
the year. They shared their analysis of the Group’s 
historic strategy, which had pursued expensive and 
unsuccessful exploration activities that resulted in 
significant value destruction to shareholders. They 
asked us if we would be prepared to be nominated as 
directors of Bowleven and we each agreed to stand for 
election as independent Directors.
Board Changes
A General Meeting was requisitioned and, as 
shareholders now know, on 14 March 2017, Eli Chahin 
and I were elected Directors and the then Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and three of 
the Non-Executive Directors were removed from office. 
David Clarkson, the Chief Operating Officer, was not 
the subject of a requisition to remove him and remained 
in post as COO.
On 31 March, it was announced that Billy Allan had 
resigned from the Board and Eli Chahin was appointed 
as Chief Executive Officer. Joe Darby joined the 
Board, as Non-Executive Director, bringing extensive 
oil and gas experience, and I became Chairman. 
With David Clarkson, we were a newly constituted 
Board, determined to refocus the Company’s 
strategy on maximising value from our existing 
Bowleven is now 
better aligned to 
delivering long-term 
value for all 
shareholders and the 
operating model and 
balance sheet 
strength will ensure 
that can happen.
assets and reducing corporate expenses. Subsequent 
discussions which we conducted with our institutional 
shareholders, confirmed that this strategy enjoys 
strong support throughout our shareholder base.
New Leadership
Six months have passed in which we have swiftly put 
this strategy into action. I would like to pay tribute to 
Eli Chahin for his bold and efficient leadership and to 
David Clarkson for his tireless efforts in support, which 
have allowed the Bowleven Group to achieve such a 
material transformation in such a short period of time.
The Company’s overhead base has been substantially 
reduced with new exploration activity costs virtually 
eliminated. We have relocated our head office from a 
large prestigious Edinburgh building to a small 
operation near London Bridge. This has resulted in a 
reduction in full time employees from 40 to fewer than 
ten, a workforce which has proven to be sufficient and 
effective for the Company’s activities. These were 
challenging steps for the individuals affected, and the 
Board would like to thank both current and former 
employees for their co-operation and patience during a 
difficult period. The Board is now able to look forward 
to executing its strategy from a sustainable footing. That 
is to maximise the value of both our 25% Etinde 
offshore interest and our interest in Bomono, utilising 
the prospective arrangement with VOG, and dealing 
with any future demands for funding of these 
investments through careful deployment of the 
Company’s $86m cash balance.
Delivering Value
With Crown Ocean’s representative, Matt McDonald, 
having recently joined the Board, we are completely 
aligned on our ambition to deliver value for all 
shareholders. We are looking forward to the new 
operating model for the Group and the value of 
our Etinde and Bomono assets being recognised 
in the Bowleven share price, as progress towards 
monetisation of these fields materialises during 2018.
