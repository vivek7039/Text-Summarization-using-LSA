Complementary services 
Banking and loan services
We offer loans to our existing clients secured against their 
investment portfolios and, in some cases, other assets. As a 
licensed deposit taker, we are also able to offer our clients a range 
of banking services including currency and payment services, 
and fixed interest term deposits. These additional services are 
valued by our clients and are an important point of 
differentiation from many of our peers.
Financial planning 
We offer in-house financial planning, which provides whole of 
market advice to clients. Our in-house financial planners are 
experts at thinking ahead and have long-standing experience of 
advising individuals, couples and families, companies and trusts. 
Unitised Portfolio Service
Using Rathbone Multi Asset Portfolio Funds, we offer clients 
with investible assets of £25,000 or more our model-based 
discretionary investment management services. This is 
designed for clients who do not require a fully bespoke 
investment solution, but still want access to an investment 
manager who will undertake suitability to ensure investment 
needs are selected and monitored to suit their individual 
circumstance, as well as ensuring that their investments are 
managed in a tax-efficient manner.
Managed Portfolio Service 
A simple and straightforward execution-only investment service 
which gives clients with £15,000 or more the ability to access 
high-quality investments. The service is delivered at a price that 
reflects the competitive nature of our sector, but to a standard 
that clients have come to expect from Rathbones. 
We also operate the following additional entities:
