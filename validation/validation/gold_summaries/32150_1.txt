 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
FY17 WAS ANOTHER STRONG YEAR 
FOR SOPHOS, IN WHICH WE MADE 
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AGAINST 
OUR STRATEGIC GOALS, AND 
DELIVERED OPERATIONAL AND 
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ABOVE 
OUR EXPECTATIONS
OVERVIEW
Among the many highlights, the Group saw an 18.2 
percent increase in total reported billings to $632.1 
million, underpinned by 21.4 percent subscription 
billings growth to $513.1 million, as we again delivered 
growth in excess of the market in both network and 
enduser security. Encouragingly, the strong momentum 
at the heart of this performance was manifest across all 
major regions and products, and in both new business 
and renewals, and accelerated in the second half of 
the year. Sophos Central remained a core driver of 
our business, delivering growth of 220 percent and 
an expanding opportunity for cross-sell and upsell 
momentum. Our cash generation was very strong, 
with unlevered free cash flow almost tripling to $133.4 
million, from $46.4 million in the prior-year.
STRATEGIC PROGRESS
Sophos made significant progress in FY17, consolidating 
its position as the leading vendor of innovative, simple, 
and highly effective cybersecurity solutions for mid-
market enterprises. A number of factors have helped to 
deliver this success which will continue to drive Sophos 
forward in the years ahead, including:
 » World-class products and innovation that provide 
leading enterprise-grade protection validated by 
numerous third parties, that at the same time are 
easy to deploy, use, and manage
 » Cloud-enabled security solutions that include 
a single, integrated cloud-based management 
console and cloud delivery of multiple security 
capabilities
 » Synchronized security product strategy, in which 
network, endpoint, and all the key offerings in our 
product portfolio actively share threat intelligence 
information to deliver better protection that is also 
easier to manage
 » 100% channel sales model
 » Deepening and expanding our relationship with our 
partners and customers, to drive upsell and cross-sell
A FAST-GROWING CHANNEL 
AND CUSTOMER BASE
The number of Sophos partners grew to more than 
30,000, up from 20,000 a year ago, and the number of 
‘blue-chip’ partners rose from 4,700 to 6,100. In FY17 
we added more than 40,000 new customers, with more 
than 260,000 organisations now using one or more 
Sophos IT security products. With more than 60 million 
small and mid-market enterprises around the world who 
could benefit from Sophos’ industry-leading security 
portfolio, integrated and managed through a single, 
easy-to-use cloud-based platform, and sold entirely 
through the channel, our opportunity to continue to 
grow our market share remains significant.
SOPHOS CENTRAL
A robust, comprehensive commitment to the cloud has 
provided Sophos with a growing competitive advantage. 
Sophos Central is a single, integrated cloud-based 
management and reporting platform that has become a 
meaningful driver of the Group’s software subscriptions. 
Sophos Central represents 17.1 percent of subscription 
billings, having grown by 220 percent in the period. 
Leveraging the power of the cloud also allows us to 
deliver compelling cross-sell and upsell opportunities 
for partners, and many are now building additional 
services businesses around the Sophos partner portal, 
which enables them to manage, update and configure 
their customers’ solutions remotely.
The Group expanded and enhanced Sophos Central 
throughout the year, with new endpoint, server and 
mobile security solutions, as well as additional partner 
and managed service provider (MSP) features. In 
addition, Sophos made a number of applications 
available on the platform for the first time, including 
email, encryption, wireless, and web security. 
September 2016 saw the launch of Intercept X, 
an exciting next-generation endpoint protection 
application, featuring signature-less anti-exploit, 
anti-ransomware and root cause analytics capabilities. 
Intercept X has resonated extremely well with partners 
16 and customers. In just two quarters since its launch, 
more than 8,000 customers have purchased Intercept X 
on the Sophos Central cloud-management platform.
WORLD-CLASS PRODUCTS AND INNOVATION
A commitment to industry-leading innovation, focused 
on our target customer, combined with a strong 
demand backdrop and an increasingly powerful channel 
ecosystem enabled Sophos to continue to gain market 
share, outpacing market growth rates in both enduser 
and network security.
In addition to the launch of Intercept X, there was an 
enthusiastic response to the newest release of the 
Sophos XG Firewall, helping the Group achieve 17.8 
percent growth in network security billings for the 
year, at constant currency. With version 16.0 launched 
in October 2016, customers are benefiting from over 
100 new features and significant enhancements to 
the user experience, particularly navigation, policy 
management and logging, as well as additional 
synchronized security features linking the XG firewall 
with endpoint, encryption, mobile, and other security 
offerings. Sophos is already a leader in the emerging 
cloud-based infrastructure market for security, a 
growing opportunity as enterprises adopt infrastructure 
as a service via the cloud. XG Firewall version 16.0 
introduced support for the Microsoft Azure cloud 
platform in addition to the existing support for Amazon 
Web Services.
ACQUISITIONS
In February 2017 Sophos announced the acquisition of 
Invincea, Inc., a leading developer of advanced next-
generation malware protection, consistently ranked 
as among the best performing signature-less, next-
generation endpoint technologies in third-party testing, 
rated highly both for high detection and low false-
positive rates. The Invincea endpoint security portfolio 
prevents, detects, and remediates zero-day and 
sophisticated attacks, and combines neural-network 
based machine learning and behavioural monitoring to 
enhance detection through artificial intelligence and 
stop evasive malware before damage occurs.
Invincea complements and enhances Sophos’ existing 
presence in next-generation endpoint protection, a 
dynamic new segment that is serving to increase 
meaningfully the size and growth rate of the multi-
billion dollar endpoint security market as a whole. 
Invincea’s advanced machine learning technology is a 
critical element in the broad array of advanced endpoint 
technology components that customers will require 
in order to protect themselves effectively against the 
growing number and sophistication of cyber threats 
that face organisations of all sizes. The integration 
of the Invincea technology into the Sophos Central 
endpoint product line is progressing well, with the first 
Sophos products incorporating Invincea’s machine 
learning technology expected to be available and sold 
via our global channel of over 30,000 partners in 2017, 
bringing immediate value to customers.
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17 DEEPENING THE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH OUR CUSTOMERS
We further increased the amount of cross-sell and upsell 
business with existing customers, a key element of the 
Group’s growth strategy. Our net renewal rate achieved 
on our subscription business was over 106 percent in the 
year, including cross-sell and upsell, versus 102 percent 
a year ago. Furthermore, the proportion of customers 
purchasing both the Sophos endpoint and unified threat 
management (UTM) products was just under 10 percent 
at the end of the period, up from 7 percent a year ago. The 
continued improvement in these areas demonstrates 
the Group’s success in leveraging its product portfolio 
and the benefits that both partners and customers are 
gaining from an integrated, synchronised approach 
to IT security.
INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP
During the year, leading industry analysts including 
Gartner and Forrester once again endorsed Sophos as a 
leader for products in both enduser and network security. 
In addition, Sophos won numerous channel awards, 
including 2016 Endpoint Security Innovation winner (CRN 
US), 2016 Data Security winner (CRN US), 2016 Network 
Security winner (CRN US), 2016 Security Vendor of the 
Year (CRN UK), and 2016 Channel Excellence Award 
winner - Security Hardware (Channel Partner DACH). 
Furthermore, in February 2017, five senior Sophos 
executives were named in CRN’s prestigious list of 2017 
Channel Chiefs, which represents top leaders in the IT 
channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their 
organisations through channel partners.
While we are pleased with the scale, growth, and 
momentum we have established, we firmly believe 
we are just getting started. Security continues to be a 
mission-critical, board-level priority for organisations 
of every size that only rises in importance with each 
passing year. Delivering true enterprise-grade protection 
to mid-market enterprises, in a way that is integrated 
and simple to deploy and manage, all sold through the 
channel, provides Sophos with a substantial market 
opportunity. Our company mission is to be the best in the 
world at delivering innovative, simple, and highly-effective 
cybersecurity solutions to IT professionals and the channel 
that serves them. We believe we are uniquely positioned 
to successfully execute against that mission, and as we 
do so, our opportunities to continue to grow and succeed, 
both operationally and financially, are dramatic. 
 
Sophos’ success is only possible through the 
commitment and hard work of our global team of 
employees and partners, and I would like to extend my 
personal thanks to them for all they do to support and 
protect hundreds of thousands of organisations around 
the world each day.
