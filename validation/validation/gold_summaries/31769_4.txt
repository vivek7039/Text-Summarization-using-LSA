Our divisions
Focusrite
Originally the Focusrite division 
sold large studio consoles. 
Since that starting point 28 years 
ago, the division has evolved 
to provide a spectrum of highly 
advanced technologically-
driven products. These range 
from recording equipment for 
hobbyists all the way to audio 
networking systems for large 
organisations, such as NBC 
and Microsoft. Importantly, the 
Focusrite name has always 
meant legendary, top-of-the-
range sound quality. Through 
product innovation we now offer 
the best value to a wide range 
of different market segments. 
As a result, we’ve become 
the number one producer of 
audio interfaces in the world.
Novation
Novation, a brand well known for 
synthesisers, was acquired by 
Focusrite in 2004, Novation now 
represents about a third of our 
revenue. Making new instruments 
and software for electronic 
music, the fastest-growing music 
creation segment, Novation is 
disrupting how music is made 
with its grid controllers, iOS 
software and new approaches 
to mobile music making.
Our global coverage
The Group’s products are sold globally 
through distribution and our e-commerce 
platform. We utilise an effective mix of 
retailers – online and ‘bricks and mortar’ 
distributors in areas where localisation  
is a factor, a hybrid approach in the USA 
utilising a distributor with our own demand 
generation team, and direct business to 
consumer with our e-commerce store  
and in-app software purchases. 
Over 800,000 physical products were 
sold to end-users last year. Our music 
creation apps were downloaded 2.7 million 
times in FY17, with approximately 
700,000 in-app customer transactions. 
Our suppliers are chiefly based in China 
and we use third-party logistics support. 
We employ around 190 people in the UK, 
USA, Germany and Hong Kong.
