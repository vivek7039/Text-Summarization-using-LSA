p26 Chief Financial Officer’s Review
(1) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, onerous leases and other non-cash items, impairments and 
reversals of impairments, transaction and reorganisation costs, gains and losses on disposals of assets and subsidiaries and the settlement of the defined 
benefit pension liability. Adjusted EBITDA is considered an accurate and consistent measure of the Group’s trading performance; items adjusted to arrive 
at Adjusted EBITDA are considered to be outside of the Group’s ongoing trading activities. 
(2)  Adjusted profit before tax is calculated by adding back amortisation of intangible assets (excluding acquired movie distribution rights), and certain 
non-cash items and foreign exchange as set out in Note 5 to the financial statements. Adjusted profit before tax is used an internal measure by 
management, as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the Group and therefore a more meaningful comparison of performance 
from period to period. Adjusted profit after tax is arrived at by applying an effective tax rate to taxable adjustments and deducting the total from 
adjusted profit before tax.
(3) To provide information on a comparable basis, where percentage change vs prior year information includes performance generated in currencies other 
than Sterling, the percentage is presented on a constant currency basis. Constant currency movements have been calculated by applying the 2017 
average exchange rates to 2016 performance.
(4) ROW is defined as the Rest of the World and includes Poland, Israel, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
(5) In accordance with IAS33 the basic and diluted EPS figures have been adjusted for the bonus element rights issue as part of the Regal Entertainment 
Group acquisition.
