Strategic Report
Chairman’s statement
Another very successful year
Ken Archer
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present this Annual Financial Report 2017 which 
records another very successful year for the Group.
All financial targets were met or exceeded following the continuing 
successful deployment of the Clareti platform across a variety 
of financial services sectors globally. The Group has achieved notable 
sales success in North America following its sales and marketing 
investment in the region.
This result stems from the effectiveness of the Group’s ongoing 
investment in its core product for transaction data management 
and its successful implementation on behalf of our clients.
Overview
Gresham continued to build upon the previously stated strategic 
objectives (see Strategy, page 12) and I am delighted with our 26% 
top-line growth with total revenues for the Group rising to £21.7m. 
Importantly, we have continued to secure new, high-margin recurring 
Clareti revenues, which has resulted in Clareti annualised recurring 
revenues closing at £5.7m (up 24% over 2016) and associated growth 
in underlying profitability yielding an adjusted EBITDA for the Group 
of £5.1m (up 34% over 2016). 
Our clients have been operating in a challenging market environment 
characterised by geo-political and legislative uncertainties as well as 
increased (and increasing) regulatory demands. These factors have 
given rise to client operating cost pressures, which have a constraining 
effect on IT investment. At the same time, these pressures drive demand 
for more effective IT solutions to improve internal efficiency. A critical 
factor in the efficient management and reporting of client processed 
transactions is the accuracy of the data received by, and contained within, 
these transaction flows. Clareti offers clients a strategic platform to 
address these challenges by better management of data, automation 
of transaction reconciliation and exception management thereby 
increasing efficiency of processing, improved risk management and 
compliant reporting. The increasing volume of transactions is a 
demand driver for our core solution Clareti Transaction Control (“CTC”). 
As mentioned earlier, the Group has made substantial progress in 
expanding the adoption of Clareti solutions globally. The important 
North America market contributed 39% of new Clareti sales in 2017 
following investment in the direct sales team. The North America market 
has the potential for much higher growth and the Board continues to 
support the ongoing investments in direct sales, in addition to forming 
strategic alliances to further expand distribution capacity.
2017 has been a very successful 
year for the Group, which of course 
is made up of a great many team 
and individual successes. This is 
a testament to the hard work, 
expertise and professionalism 
of the Gresham team. Gresham Technologies plc

Strategic Report
Ongoing investments
The Board continues to believe there is a very significant market 
opportunity for data integrity and control solutions and that ongoing 
investment in key strategic areas is essential. Accordingly, the Company 
is making further investments in sales, marketing and implementation 
resources, in order to capitalise on the market opportunity and 
accelerate Clareti growth.
As noted above, regulatory reporting demands on our clients are 
increasing both in number and complexity. Technology will increasingly 
be used to respond to these demands and we believe our Clareti platform 
is well suited as a data framework for regulatory control. We are already 
working with several clients to develop our offerings and would expect 
strong sales demand to follow.
Board changes
In May 2017 , Andy Balchin joined the Board as Independent 
Non-Executive Director and chair of the audit committee. Andy Balchin is 
currently Chief Financial Officer of the cyber division of RUAG Holding AG, 
a major Swiss organisation, which acquired Clearswift, a provider of 
cyber security solutions, in January 2017 , where he was CFO, and brings 
significant financial experience in high-growth software companies. He 
replaced Chris Errington who left the Board after serving previously as 
CFO and CEO.
We welcome Tom Mullan to the Board as Chief Financial Officer, 
and we look forward to working with him as we continue the successful 
development of the Company. He replaces Rob Grubb who has made 
an outstanding contribution to the Group’s development over the last 
nine years and who leaves with our very best wishes.
Shareholder value
Our share price has continued to experience a degree of volatility in 
the year which is common for the small cap market, but it is pleasing to 
note that the overall upward trend persists. Earnings per share increased 
to 6.5 pence on an adjusted and diluted basis (2016: 4.7 pence). 
In light of the Company’s increasing profitability and strong cash 
reserves, I am pleased to confirm that the Company will be commencing 
the payment of a progressive dividend. In respect of financial year 2017 , 
the Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.5 pence per share for 
shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The Gresham organisation and its employees are fully aligned to growing 
profitable revenue from Clareti sales globally. I remain confident that 
our investments in sales, marketing and client success provide the 
platform to deliver shareholder value from our ongoing investments.
In summary
With our continued investment in the Clareti portfolio and sales and 
marketing expansion, I anticipate further improvement in our market 
position as we respond to the growing demand for transparency and 
integrity over risk and financial data processing. 2017 has been a very 
successful year for the Group, which of course is made up of a great 
many team and individual successes. This is a testament to the hard 
work, expertise and professionalism of the Gresham team. I would like 
to thank the management and staff for their continued support and 
resolve to achieve success in our pursuit of market leadership in 
real-time transaction control and enterprise data integrity.
