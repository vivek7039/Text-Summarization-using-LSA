 EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to report that Serica made strong 
progress in 2017. With the announcement in late 
November of Serica’s acquisition of operated interests 
in the Bruce, Keith and Rhum fields (BKR Assets), the 
Company had a very strong finish to what was an 
excellent year. Gross profits from operations amounted 
to just under US$20 million, a three-fold increase over 
the prior year, derived solely from our interest in Erskine.
Serica’s target over the past two/three years has been to 
diversify the risk associated with being reliant on Erskine 
as a single production source and grow into a profitable 
mid-tier independent oil and gas producer through an 
acquisition led strategy, concentrating on assets where 
we believed that we could add value through our own 
expertise. I am very pleased to report that, with the 
agreement to purchase the BKR Assets from BP we are 
now well on our way to achieving this goal. These fields 
hold significant potential which Serica believes it can 
unlock as a focused, low cost and innovative operator 
under the leadership of Mitch Flegg who joined us as 
Chief Executive upon announcement of the transaction.
We welcome Mitch and the team who have joined with 
him. They will be joined on completion of the acquisition 
by experienced staff from BP who bring their expertise 
and knowledge of the assets to cement what I believe 
will be a very strong and technically competent team 
capable of running an exciting new growth phase 
for the Company.
The acquisition of the BKR Assets provides for an 
effective date of 1 January 2018. Apart from a short period 
of production interruptions in early January linked to 
a shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System and the 
impact of very severe weather conditions in the latter 
part of February and early March, the assets have been 
performing well since the start of this year. The assets 
are expected to bring material benefit to Serica upon 
completion of the acquisition, now expected in the third 
quarter this year. The ensuing period will be taken up 
by implementing the complex programme to enable a 
safe and efficient transfer of operations and securing the 
various consents required for the transfer and ensuing 
operations. To-date we are making good progress with 
all of these transition requirements, working closely with 
BP, partners and the various regulatory bodies.
Further information, as well as an update on Erskine 
where production is currently suspended due to a 
pipeline blockage, is provided in the Chief Executive’s 
Report and the Operations and Financial Reviews but 
the overall impact of the acquisition will be significant 
to the Company and its future prospects. Underlying 
reserves will have increased some sixteen-fold to 
approximately 50 million boe as at 1 January 2018 and 
the strength and depth of the Company will have been 
transformed by combining the Company’s skills with 
those of the BP employees joining us. Production is 
projected to increase significantly, with potential for 
further increases, and the Company’s financial position is 
expected to increase commensurately.
Following completion of the transaction, Serica’s 
production will be predominantly gas, with the Rhum 
and Bruce fields alone accounting for up to 5% of total 
UK gas production. At a time of rising political tensions 
and limited UK gas storage capacity this focus on gas 
should also provide a strong underpinning for Serica. 
4 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Whilst there will undoubtedly be challenges ahead I 
am very optimistic about the Company’s future and its 
ability to consolidate our recent acquisition and build 
on the platform that we have now created. Our future 
plans include organic growth, developing the position 
we will have in four North Sea producing fields as well as 
developing our Columbus interest and commencing an 
exploration programme with the Rowallan well whilst we 
review options for our interests in Namibia and Ireland. 
However, we will also continue to seek ways in which 
we can add new assets through selective acquisition to 
complement our strong production base and build a 
robust and exciting portfolio with further potential for 
value-generating growth.
In summary, I am delighted with the positive outcome 
which has resulted from the skills and focus of Serica’s 
team and a considerable amount of effort on their part. 
I would like to thank them on shareholders’ behalf, 
welcome all newcomers to the Company and look 
forward to an exciting period ahead.
