Overview
Chairman’s statement
The	 Group	 has	 a	 clear	 long-term	 strategy	 to	 become	 a	 world-class	 global	
aviation	 services	 group.	 Great	 progress	 has	 been	 made	 since	 we	 began	 this	
transformation	 in	 2014,	 and	 the	 period	 under	 review	 has	 been	 no	 exception.	
Indeed,	 it	 has	 perhaps	 been	 the	 most	 active	 and	 successful	 period	 we	 have	
experienced	 during	 my	 12	 years	 at	 Air	 Partner.
I	 am	 pleased	 to	 report	 a	 strong	 performance	 for	 the	 year	
ended	 31	 January	 2017.	 Gross	 profit	 rose	 by	 16.3%	 to	 £31.7m,	
underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 increased	 by	 17.2%	 to	 £5.1m	
and	 reported	 profit	 before	 tax	 by	 38.6%	 to	 £4.3m.
As	 I	 have	 mentioned	 in	 prior	 reports,	 in	 2014	 we	 took	
a	 thoughtful	 and	 critical	 look	 at	 our	 industry	 to	 evaluate	
not	 only	 our	 own	 market	 position,	 but	 the	 challenges	 and	
opportunities	 that	 lie	 ahead.	 As	 part	 of	 that	 process,	 we	
undertook	 an	 extensive	 programme	 of	 engagement	 with	 our	
staff	 and	 customers	 to	 understand	 not	 only	 their	 needs,	 but	
their	 expectations	 of	 us.	 No	 stone	 was	 left	 unturned	 and	 we	
looked	 far	 into	 the	 future	 to	 assess	 what	 we	 wanted	 to	 be,	
where	 we	 wanted	 to	 be,	 and	 just	 as	 importantly,	 where	 we	
did	 not	 want	 to	 be.	
We	 formed	 a	 long-term	 strategy	 that	 places	 the	 customer	
first	 and	 has	 the	 power	 to	 transform	 our	 business	 model,	
reducing	 volatility	 and	 improving	 the	 overall	 quality	 of	 our	
earnings.	 This	 year,	 the	 results	 of	 this	 long-term	 strategy	 are	
beginning	 to	 emerge.
Maintaining a progressive dividend
We	 are	 proposing	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 3.6p,	 taking	 the	 full	
year	 dividend	 to	 5.2p,	 an	 increase	 of	 7.2%	 and	 equivalent	 to	
1.3	 times	 dividend	 cover.	 Our	 policy	 is	 to	 target	 cover	 between	
1.5	 and	 2.0	 times	 underlying	 earnings	 per	 share.	 Cover	 this	
year	 is	 below	 that	 range,	 due	 to	 a	 £0.4m	 prior	 year,	 one-off	
adjustment	 for	 tax.	 Subject	 to	 approval	 at	 the	 AGM	 on	 28	 June	
2017,	 we	 expect	 to	 pay	 the	 final	 dividend	 on	 5	 July	 to	 those	
shareholders	 on	 the	 register	 at	 close	 of	 business	 on	 9	 June.	
Board changes
During	 the	 period,	 we	 completed	 the	 alignment	 of	 our	 Board	
to	 reflect	 the	 direction	 of	 our	 long-term	 strategy.	 Accordingly,	 we	
welcomed	 Amanda	 Wills	 CBE,	 Shaun	 Smith	 and	 Richard	 Jackson	
to	 the	 Board,	 effective	 20	 April,	 1	 May	 and	 8	 September	 2016	
respectively.	 Having	 overseen	 these	 changes,	 we	 announced	 on	
2	 February	 2017	 that	 I	 would	 be	 standing	 down	 as	 Chairman	 at	
the	 next	 AGM	 on	 28	 June	 2017	 after	 12	 years	 as	 a	 non-executive	
director.	 I	 am	 delighted	 that,	 following	 a	 formal	 selection	 process,	
Peter	 Saunders,	 our	 current	 Senior	 Independent	 Director,	 will	
replace	 me	 as	 Chairman	 effective	 from	 that	 date,	 subject	 to	 his	
re-election	 at	 the	 AGM.	 Peter	 has	 played	 an	 important	 role	 in	
our	 transformation	 and	 I	 trust	 will	 continue	 to	 both	 support	
and	 challenge	 the	 Executive	 team	 in	 the	 years	 ahead.
Thank you
Air	 Partner	 is	 a	 unique	 company.	 Our	 plc	 status	 is	 a	 key	
strength:	 it	 offers	 customers,	 employees	 and	 shareholders	 –	
indeed,	 all	 our	 stakeholders	 –	 reassurance	 that	 we	 operate	
to	 the	 highest	 standards	 of	 governance	 and	 ethics,	 and	 are	
transparent	 in	 all	 our	 finances	 and	 business	 dealings.	 Over	
the	 past	 five	 years	 since	 I	 became	 Chairman,	 it	 has	 been	 my	
privilege	 to	 witness	 the	 development	 of	 Air	 Partner	 from	
a	 pure	 broking	 business,	 to	 the	 vibrant,	 diverse	 aviation	
services	 company	 it	 is	 today.	 People	 are	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 our	
business,	 and	 it	 remains	 for	 me	 to	 thank	 my	 colleagues	 on	
the	 Board	 and	 across	 the	 whole	 Group	 for	 their	 support	 and	
hard	 work,	 not	 only	 in	 delivering	 a	 great	 set	 of	 results	 for	 our	
shareholders	 this	 year,	 but	 also	 in	 creating	 a	 strong	 platform	
for	 growth.	 I	 wish	 you	 all	 every	 success	 into	 2017	 and	 beyond.
