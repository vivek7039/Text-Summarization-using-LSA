Chairman’s Statement 
A DEMANDING YEAR “The second half provides 
the platform for growth”  
 
A mixed performance against challenging market 
conditions 
 
“The Group had a mixed trading year based on a weak first half being offset by a 
strong second half performance and record order book entering the new financial 
year” 
 
The Board 
Key areas of focus for the Board in FY2018 
These areas include inter alia: 
 Evolution of our marketing and sales strategy;  
 Further development of our people; 
 Utilising the Centre of Excellence to its full potential; 
 Enhancing the position of Peter Brotherhood in its end markets; and 
 Completion of the announced transaction with Avingtrans plc. 
 
Dear Shareholder 
I am sorry to report on a mixed trading year albeit mitigated by a record order book as 
we move into the new financial year FY2018.  Acknowledging the demanding trading 
period I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Executive Directors and all the 
team, on your behalf, for their contribution in a very challenging market and their 
tireless devotion in ensuring the long-term security of both Hayward Tyler and Peter 
Brotherhood. 
 
Results Overview 
The results for the year reflect a steady performance from the Hayward Tyler and Peter 
Brotherhood businesses at the gross contribution level but a lack of revenue particularly in the 
first half of FY2017 ultimately meant that we only achieved breakeven at the trading
1
 EBITDA 
level for the full year, which generated a reported loss for the year of £3.9 million (FY2016: 
profit of £2.4 million). 
 
Against a backdrop of challenging end markets and continuing uncertain economic times, 
Hayward Tyler’s performance was dampened in 1H2017 before recovering strongly in 
2H2017 and we expect it to strengthen in FY2018. This strengthening will come from amongst 
other things; the improving prospects for Peter Brotherhood and the beneficial impact of the 
Centre of Excellence, which when utilised more fully will drive greater profitability. The major 
focus for HTG looking forward continues to be the development of the order pipeline and 
order book to create a significantly higher revenue business.    
 
Further details of the trading performance are set out in the Chief Executive’s Business 
Review and the Financial Review. 
 
Dividend 
Given the announced proposed acquisition of the Company by Avingtrans plc we do not 
intend to recommend the payment of a final dividend for FY2017.  We understand that 
Avingtrans plc has a progressive dividend policy.

Outlook 
The expansion of the Group through the acquisition of Peter Brotherhood together with the 
continued focus on developing our Hayward Tyler business, by expanding our production 
capabilities and investing in research and development, means that the Group remains well 
placed to achieve the Board’s growth ambitions provided it has the right capital structure in 
place.  
 
This external driven growth is dependent inter alia on positive market conditions which we 
anticipate will improve during the current year. With a record order book as we enter FY2018 
the Board remains confident in the underlying profitability, our ability to take excess cost out 
of the Group and the longer term prospects for the business. 
 
It is clear that these prospects are well understood and appreciated by the directors of 
Avingtrans plc who have now made an offer to acquire the entire share capital of the 
Company. 
 
Yours faithfully
