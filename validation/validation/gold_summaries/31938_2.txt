1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and refers to ‘earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation’. This includes 
adjustments for certain other items charged to operating profit 
that do not reflect the underlying business performance. See page 
23 for where this measure is fully reconciled back to operating 
profit as presented in the income statement. 
2 Operating cash flow after capital and financial investment 
activities is a non-GAAP measure and represents the net cash 
generated by the business after investment in capital items. This 
represents the remaining cash available to service the capital 
structure of the business, or the return of cash to shareholders in 
the form of dividends. A full reconciliation between this measure 
and net cash generated from operations is presented on page 24.
3 Key drivers are stated along with the operating segment 
in which these business streams are aligned, i.e. T elecoms 
& M2M (‘T elM2M’) and T errestrial Broadcast (‘TB’). The 
‘disposed businesses’ principally relate to T elM2M, whilst ‘other 
movements’ reflect a number of smaller movements across the 
business as a whole. Further information and narrative is included 
in the financial review on page 21.
