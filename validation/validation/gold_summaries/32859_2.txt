 ABU DHABI, UAE ALGERIA IRAQ OMAN
     
The highlight was progress on  
the UZ750 offshore project at the 
Upper Zakum oil field, our share of 
which is valued at US$3.5 billion.  
At the height of the project some 
14,000 workers were involved, 
including 5,000 onsite, and it 
reached more than 58 million  
man-hours LTI free. During 2017 , 
we delivered and installed all of  
the modules, and contract 
completion is set for mid-2018.
An important milestone was the 
completion and commissioning  
of the In Salah southern fields 
development. We also introduced 
gas into the Reggane North 
Development plant and, by the close 
of the year, we were ready for the 
introduction of gas into the Alrar plant.
Building on our success in Iraq,  
securing several new contract 
awards and extensions which, 
together, are worth more than 
US$300 million. These include 
engineering, operations and 
maintenance services agreements 
with international oil companies, 
plus we extended our long-term 
contract with Basra Oil Company 
and expanded our scope  
of services.
On our upstream projects, we 
completed Phase 1 of the Khazzan 
central processing facility for BP  
and were awarded Phase 2.  
We also secured a 10-year EPCm 
framework agreement with 
Petroleum Development Oman, 
which builds on our work on the 
Rabab Harweel Integrated project 
and Yibal Khuff project. In terms  
of downstream projects, the Sohar 
refinery is now in commercial 
operation, and we were awarded  
the Duqm Refinery project,  
in a 50/50 joint venture with 
Samsung Engineering.

 MALAYSIA SAUDI ARABIA UK KUWAIT
      
Malaysia continues to be an 
important market for Petrofac. 
Production levels remain in line with 
expectations at Block PM304, which 
we operate on behalf of PETRONAS, 
and we continue to make good 
progress on the US$500 million 
Refinery and Petrochemicals 
Integrated Development (RAPID) 
EPCC project.
In Saudi Arabia we continue  
to build on our downstream 
credentials. By the close of the year 
we had reached commissioning 
phase for both the Petro Rabigh 
petrochemicals plant and the 
Jazan South tank farm project.
In September 2017 , Petrofac 
marked 20 years since we first 
pioneered the outsourced Duty 
Holder model in the North Sea. 
During the year, we secured a 
number of contract awards and 
extensions, including a three-year 
extension of a maintenance 
services contract with BP and a 
12-month extension for engineering 
services with Chevron.
We successfully reached the  
pre-commissioning phase of  
the KNPC Clean Fuels Project  
for Kuwait National Petroleum.  
We also secured a lump-sum  
EPC project with Kuwait Oil 
Company, valued at US$1 .3 billion,  
for GC32, the first sour oil and  
gas gathering centre in the  
Burgan oil field.

OPERATIONAL PROGRESS IN 2017
Across our portfolio of lump-sum projects, we delivered more than 217 
million man-hours, maintained an excellent safety record and secured 
US$4.1 billion of new orders. Meanwhile, in our reimbursable business,  
we secured contract awards and extensions valued at US$1.1 billion.  
In IES, we made good progress in re-shaping our portfolio and improving 
performance. By the close of the year, our order backlog stood at 
US$10.2 billion, giving us good revenue visibility.
