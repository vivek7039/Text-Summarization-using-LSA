MULTIPLE UNCONVENTIONAL

The evaluation of the Vaca Muerta 
shale formation is well under way in the 
Puesto Rojas area in Mendoza province 
with five wells targeting the formation 
in 2017. A number of wells have also 
been drilled in the Agrio and Chachao 
formations at the nearby Cerro Pencal 
area, also demonstrating the potential 
for unconventional development. A full 
3D seismic survey in southern Puesto 
Rojas is being processed and interpreted 
to plan for future drilling.
In Neuquén province, a significant Vaca 
Muerta opportunity exists at the Mata 
Mora and Corralera concessions that are 
proximate to and on trend with the most 
prolific Vaca Muerta producing licences.

Vaca Muerta is a world-class unconventional 
resource play with current production in excess 
of 90,000 boepd and a production expectation 
of more than 110,000 boepd in 2018, double 
2016 production. Unconventional oil and gas 
has the potential to transform the future of 
Argentina’s economy.
Why  
Vaca 
Muerta?
Recoverable shale gas resources
(Tcf)
Significant investment to date
YPF announced JVs with major players 
over past five years:
 > Since 2013:   Chevron, Dow

 > Since 2015:  Wintershall, Sinopec
 > Since 2017:   Schlumberger,
