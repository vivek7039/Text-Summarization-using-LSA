STRATEGIC REPORT
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
“ It has been another excellent 
year of growth and ﬁ nancial 
performance.”
2017 review
2017 has been another exciting year for the business. We 
have expanded our European footprint and client offering 
further across attractive markets where the Group targets 
leadership positions. When viewed alongside our diversified 
investment portfolio and expanding asset management 
business, it has been another excellent year of growth and 
financial performance.
Strong financial performance
Total revenue grew 35.2% to £319.0 million (2016: £235.9 million), 
driven by core collections 19.7% higher at £342.2 million 
(2016: £286.0 million). Profit after tax increased by 51.7% to 
£39.9 million (2016: £26.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA increased 
10.2% to £230.6 million (2016: £209.2 million). We continue to 
see an increase in the contribution from the capital-light asset 
management business, with revenues increasing by 53.5% year 
on year; our aim is to continue to grow this business over the 
medium-term, both organically and via acquisitions.
Strong performance across the business enabled us to deliver a 
significant increase in underlying profit after tax, up 24.1% to 
£56.6 million (2016: £45.6 million), and underlying return on 
equity (ROE) now stands at 32.9% (2016: 29.1%).
Basic EPS increased by 51.0% to 22.8p (2016: 15.1p) with underlying 
basic EPS increasing by 24.1% to 32.4p (2016: 26.1p). The business 
has a track record of strong cash generation and this 
enables us to deliver excellent returns to shareholders, 
while simultaneously investing for future growth. As a result, 
the full-year dividend, including the proposed final dividend 
of 8.1p, will increase to 11.3p, representing an increase of 24.2% 
and a 35.0% payout ratio – the top of our guided range.
Debt purchasing - strong portfolio investment
2017 was another strong year for investment. We acquired a 
record number of loan portfolios and loan notes with a face value 
of £2.4 billion for a purchase price of £223.9 million. Of the 
purchase price invested, 40.7% related to secured accounts. 
Additionally, over 70% of portfolio purchases were off-market 
– a record for the Group – largely driven by our unique 
model of purchasing the tails of asset portfolios already 
being serviced on our platforms. 
Our investment portfolios across the Group continue to be 
well diversified by both geography and asset class, providing 
us with good resilience against adverse conditions in any 
country or market.
Our specialist asset management business, focusing on the 
servicing of loan portfolios for our clients, continues to be 
an important growth area for the Group, with revenues from 
this business growing strongly in 2017.
A TRANSFORMA TIONAL YEAR 17
Strategic report

Asset management – continued revenue growth
When moving into new markets, we have a strong track 
record of acquiring leading servicing businesses. By working 
to retain skilled management teams, we are able to acquire 
earnings-accretive operations and gather deep data and 
insight – allowing us to deploy more of our own capital at 
strong returns in that market in the future. We expect to 
repeat this model with our acquisition of Mars Capital. This 
provided us with a strategic entry into Ireland – a new market 
for the Group, offering a €59 billion NPL opportunity – and 
significantly enhanced our servicing capabilities for mortgages 
in the UK. The acquisition is already delivering value and we 
closed our first deal on the new platform in December. As part 
of the acquisition, we also announced a strategic partnership 
with Oaktree, a leading global asset manager with over 
USD$100 billion under management. 
The strategic partnership with a tier one institutional investor 
and the two Italian acquisitions we have announced, represent 
another important step in the evolution of our asset management 
business as we move closer towards our ambition of managing 
discretionary funds on behalf of our clients.
Our aspirations for the asset management business continue 
to be high, and we are aiming to continue to grow significantly 
the business’ contribution to Group revenues. 
The Italian opportunity 
Italy is a core strategic market for us. The large size of its 
NPL market, with over €300 billion of NPLs on bank balance 
sheets and extended asset tails, provides significant long-term 
opportunities. Its specific characteristics mean that we have 
entered the country with diligence and discipline. The team 
took two years to analyse the market before deciding that 
Zenith, the master servicing business we purchased in 2017, 
was the right entry point. This acquisition has exceeded our 
expectations in all respects: AUM has grown by over 70% 
and the deep insight it has given us into the Italian market’s 
characteristics has allowed us to invest our own capital 
ahead of forecasts, and at excellent returns. Importantly, all 
investments were originated in off-market deals from the 
Zenith platform and are, therefore, assets on which we have 
excellent performance visibility.
Having made a successful start, and established strong 
foundations, we believe that now is the right time to expand 
the business. Market activity is high, as regulatory pressure 
to deal with Italian bank balance sheets has started to take 
effect and asset sales rose from €34.0 billion in 2016 to a 
projected €64.0 billion in 2017. The market potential remains 
considerable and we are seeing strong demand from Arrow’s 
clients in the alternative asset space for us to deploy the 
same capability in Italy that we have successfully offered 
them elsewhere, offering our cross-asset class special 
servicing capabilities in high level niches we understand well, 
and where we are prepared to invest our own money. This 
targeted approach is key to our success; we will not attempt 
to cover the entire Italian market, but only the parts where 
we can develop an edge and generate solid returns.
In other markets, we have built the leading servicing platform 
for both ourselves and third-party investors through a 
combination of acquisitions and organic build. We believe 
that this strategy will serve us well in Italy too given our 
long-term commitment to the market.
Our track record demonstrates that we are able to achieve 
the following:
• identify the right management teams, which fit with 
Arrow’s culture and bring local expertise;
• buy platforms at attractive prices in off-market deals, 
where value accretes to our shareholders; and
• grow acquired platforms swiftly after acquisition by tapping 
into Arrow’s broad origination footprint across a wide range 
of financial institutions and alternative asset manager clients.
The two new bolt-on acquisitions of Parr Credit – a specialist 
servicer for sophisticated financial investors that has diversified 
into small ticket utilities and telecoms servicing – and Europa 
Investimenti – an expert investor in non-performing corporate 
and SME business – are consistent with this approach. In 
addition, investment will be required in order to build out 
our credit platform offering for clients. Expanding asset class 
offerings (notably secured), systems, governance and risk 
infrastructure and adding management depth will involve a 
two-year programme of investment. This will contribute to 
our ability to grow our investment portfolio conservatively, with 
continued underwriting discipline, and to our stated ambition 
to grow asset management revenues materially by the end 
of 2018 and beyond.
Strengthened funding
During the year, we took the opportunity to strengthen and 
secure our long-term funding. In March, the Group issued 
€400 million senior secured floating rate notes due 2025, 
at a coupon of E+2.875%. 
This has meant that the Group’s weighted average cost of 
debt has been significantly reduced to 3.9% (2016: 4.9%) 
and the weighted average maturity of the Group’s debt at 
31 December 2017 was 6.1 years (2016: 5.8 years) with no 
facility maturing before March 2022. This positions us well to 
continue to run the balance sheet efficiently and capitalise 
on opportunities presented by market conditions.
We continue to be open to further opportunities to reduce 
our weighted average cost of debt and extend its duration.
Investing for growth - One Arrow
While the runway for growth provided by our significant 
market opportunity remains substantial, our strategy centres 
on controlled growth of our balance sheet, allowing us to 
maintain underwriting discipline and returns within our 
balanced capital structure.
The combination of our origination strengths, client relationships 
and servicing platforms means that we are well positioned to 
take advantage of the potential to grow capital-light asset 
management revenues. To achieve this in a safe, disciplined 
and sustainable way, we took the decision earlier in the year 
to invest further in our core capabilities.
This will see us strengthening governance and Group capabilities, 
using our knowledge and expertise from certain geographies 
in order to improve efficiency across the board. Areas of focus 
will be in our core centres of excellence: Origination, Data & 
Analytics, Portfolio Management, Risk Management and 
Change & IT Functions. In addition, we are increasing investment 
in our servicing and operating platforms across the Group to 
improve customer journeys through enhanced digital capabilities, 
which in turn, will produce improvements in our productivity.
We have outlined an investment and restructuring programme 
totalling £22.0 million across 2017 and 2018. On completion 
we will have more scalable, resilient platforms, optimised to 
support future growth. 18

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Our people
We have continued to grow welcoming new colleagues 
during the year. At the Group executive level, our Group 
chief financial officer, Rob Memmott, decided to step down 
following nearly seven years of excellent service. I would like 
to thank Rob for his huge contribution to the growth of the 
Company, and wish him the very best for the future. We 
announced in October last year that Paul Cooper would be 
joining us as Group chief financial officer in January 2018, 
and I look forward to working closely with Paul as we continue 
to steer the business along a strong growth trajectory in the 
coming years. The way in which the business develops and 
operates will be key to its success and we welcomed Clodagh 
Gunnigle as our new Group chief risk officer earlier in the year. 
Clodagh has significant experience driving risk strategy at 
large financial companies and will play a pivotal role in ensuring 
that Arrow continues to grow prudently. Most recently, we 
announced the appointment of Dave Sutherland as our 
new Group chief operating officer. His experience will add 
considerably to our management expertise at a time when 
we are continuing to grow our operations and ensure we 
maintain and strengthen our leading management capabilities. 
Following these appointments at the Group executive level, 
we streamlined the management structure. The country 
heads now report directly into Dave Sutherland, which will 
ensure that we share best practice and drive operational 
excellence across the business. 
As ever, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the 
wider Arrow Global team for all their hard work this year. 
Good culture is such an important part of any organisation, 
and I am proud to see the ongoing commitment from all my 
colleagues to Arrow’s commitment to ‘Building Better 
Financial Futures’ for all of our stakeholders. I’m excited 
about what we can all achieve together in the coming year, 
as we continue to place our values at the heart of 
the business.
Outlook
I continue to be optimistic about the potential for the business 
in a growing market. Focus on the health of financial institutions’ 
balance sheets continues to increase. Indeed, this year saw 
the European Central Bank being particularly vocal on the 
issue, suggesting banks must provision for non-performing 
loans much faster than they currently do. Combined with the 
European Banking Authority’s focus on reducing the stock of 
NPLs, this is likely to lead to increased volumes of asset sales 
across Europe, generating opportunities for Arrow to purchase 
and manage more portfolios, feeding both our debt purchase 
and asset management businesses.
Consensus regarding forecasts for UK and European GDP 
growth remains positive, but we remain well positioned to 
capitalise on any market opportunities presented by a turn 
in the economic cycle. This is supported by our resilient 
back book of paying customers and the ensuing front book 
opportunities that would arise from a portfolio pricing 
perspective in a downward cycle. As previously guided, 
we do not expect Brexit to impact our ability to operate and 
purchase portfolios in Europe, since we are individually 
licensed in all of our jurisdictions and are not reliant on the 
UK’s continuing membership of the EU.
We believe that regulatory oversight will continue to evolve in 
European markets and view this as favourable for businesses 
such as Arrow that have scale, strong funding structures and 
a focus on the right customer outcomes. We constantly evaluate 
and evolve risk and compliance activities across the entire Group, 
regardless of geography, and, wherever possible, share 
best practice. 
Increasingly, our clients look for respected partners which comply 
with regulatory requirements and have strong reputations for 
dealing fairly with customers. At Arrow Global, we are committed 
to achieving the right outcomes for our customers and I believe 
we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the 
opportunities this presents.
We remain neutral on pricing in each of our markets. While 
competition is evident across all jurisdictions, our model of 
purchasing the majority of our portfolio acquisitions off-market 
provides us with a degree of protection. The fact that we 
purchase only around half a per cent on an annual basis of all 
NPLs sold across the markets in which we operate means that 
we can be highly selective, only acquiring portfolios where we 
are confident we can achieve our required returns. Our 
diversification across geographies and asset classes on 
portfolios where our data and analytics can provide us with 
an advantage gives me great confidence about our 
future performance.
We remain relatively well insulated against the potential for 
interest rate rises when viewed alongside our strengthened 
funding position and reduced weighted average cost of debt 
fixed over a long duration. Moreover , over 60% of our unsecured 
customers do not have a mortgage, the asset most geared 
towards interest rate hikes, meaning we would not expect to 
see a material increase in payment breakage rates should interest 
rates rise. Furthermore, over two thirds of our balance sheet is 
hedged against rate rises.
In the coming year, we will remain focused on the strategic 
advantages afforded by our unique business model. We will:
• purchase specialist portfolios where we have a 
data advantage;
• maintain our strong relationships with primary lenders 
and our institutional investor clients to continue to buy 
off-market as a preferred purchaser;
• target acquisitions that provide a strategic fit; 
• continue to scale up our presence in geographies that 
fit our investment criteria; and 
• focus on our partner relationships with institutional 
investors to continue to expand our asset 
management business.
We therefore remain confident in our ability to deliver on 
our targets of achieving a medium-term underlying ROE 
percentage in the mid-twenties, high teen EPS growth 
and a progressive dividend policy.

LIVING OUR VALUES
Louise takes back control
Louise works in the public sector. 
Her circumstances improved, and 
she was earning more money each 
month. Previously, she had run 
up debts with different providers 
and she had taken the decision 
to appoint a debt management 
company to work on her behalf. 
This can be a useful way of dealing 
with creditors, but the debt 
management company charged 
a monthly fee and Louise realised 
the substantial amount she had 
paid in fees over many years.
With her improved situation, Louise 
decided to take control of her 
finances and called Arrow Global 
directly to discuss her current and 
future repayments.
Our agent took time to discuss 
Louise’s income and expenditure 
and it was identified that Louise 
could afford to increase her 
repayments from £52 per month 
to £100 per month. This would 
significantly reduce the time it 
would take Louise repay her debt.
After further discussion, Louise 
wanted to retain some flexibility 
on her disposable income in case 
of emergencies, so Louise agreed 
to increase her repayments to 
£80 per month. A further review 
was scheduled for six months, 
as Louise felt her circumstances 
may improve again. 
In this case, our agent was helpful 
throughout the call, appropriately 
signposting the free money advice 
services that are available, but after 
it was apparent Louise wanted to 
take control of her repayments to 
us, we supported her to ensure we 
found the most appropriate outcome 
for Louise’s circumstances.
