 In conversation with the Chief Executive
What is your view of the 
Group’s performance in  
the year?
Whilst the dramatic depreciation of 
Sterling, and the intensified competitive 
pressures have made it a challenging 
period for the UK business, we have made 
continued progress in the turnaround in 
the Rest of Europe. The combined result 
has been a decline in overall profitability 
which indicates it has been a tough year.  
That said, we have a clear plan with a 
robust set of actions which I think will 
mitigate some very serious headwinds 
which most retailers are feeling right now.
It’s two years since you 
launched the new strategy 
– how much progress has  
been made?
We are absolutely in the thick of it but 
we are making real progress. We have 
re-engineered virtually every aspect of 
the business: from the look and feel of 
the brand; the concerted move into hard 
flooring where we under-index versus 
the market; and the drive to improve our 
reputation and customer service. If you 
add in the number of shops that we have 
refurbished, re-sited, re-sized, or closed 
in the period, along with re-shaping our 
digital offer, it is easy to underestimate 
the size of the task that the team 
has undertaken.
Is the business where you 
planned for it to be at this point?
Not quite in terms of profit delivery for 
the reasons I outline above – but yes, in 
terms of confirming a very clear strategic 
direction and our progress with the 
operational turnaround.
How much further is there 
to go with the plan?
We are barely half way through is my 
considered judgment. We need to 
rebrand the entire estate and become 
famous for hard flooring and floorcoverings 
in general, not just carpet. We need to 
ensure our improved customer service 
gets even better and we have to keep 
our focus on reducing store numbers and 
improving the quality of our estate. The 
good news is that a lot of these initiatives 
are within our gift and are best described 
as “self help”.
What’s worked best so far 
and which areas are proving 
more difficult?
I think we have made very good progress 
in the four main areas of who we are, 
what we sell, how we sell and where 
we sell. We have obviously had to 
prioritise individual activities as trying 
to land them all overnight is a practical 
impossibility. Culture change is also 
something that has had to evolve over 
time – when practice becomes ingrained 
over an extended period of time, people 
can become institutionalised and resistant 
to change and addressing that has been 
the biggest challenge.
Strategic report continued
Has Brexit de-railed your 
recovery plans?
No – although it slowed up the first half 
considerably as Sterling depreciated 
significantly. We mitigated this in the 
second half through price increases 
and renegotiating with suppliers. The 
future and how Brexit will look is still 
very uncertain indeed but that applies 
to the whole sector where we and our 
competitors operate.
What criteria should we use 
to judge the Group’s progress 
this year?
It’s all about momentum and assessing 
whether or not the business is focusing 
on the right things. For me, it’s about the 
quality of transaction and to that end it’s 
gratifying to see our Average Transaction 
Value increase by 11% in the year. This 
is driven by the instore KPI’s and should 
give investors confidence that we are 
concentrating on the important stuff 
whatever the market conditions.
What underpins your 
confidence that the Group 
is on the right track?
Not chopping and changing what 
is a solid strategic plan is key. And 
having supportive shareholders who 
understand the retail landscape, agree 
with our initiatives and are cognisant 
of the competitive threats gives us 
confidence that we are firmly on the 
right track.
Do you have any evidence 
that consumers are now 
beginning to re-appraise the 
Carpetright brand?
As I discuss in my statement, the 
measurements from our market research, 
in particular the Brand Tracker work, 
indicates a very positive reappraisal of 
the Carpetright brand – this isn’t a case 
of “hitting and hoping”. It remains vital 
work-in-progress.
“We have a clear plan with a robust set of actions  
which I think will mitigate some very serious headwinds  
which most retailers are feeling right now.”
14 | Annual report and accounts 2017 The outlook for the UK 
consumer looks more 
uncertain – do the self-help 
measures being taken have 
enough potential for you to 
drive improved performance 
even if times in retail get 
tougher?
Undoubtedly – we cannot do anything 
about the economy, what Government 
in its infinite wisdom throws at us or 
consumer confidence. By doing the things 
within our control better, day-in day-out 
we can take market share from our 
competitors and that, in essence, is the 
plan. I would not want to be a new entrant 
in a market such as this.
How are the rebranded/
refurbished stores performing 
– are they meeting your 
expectations?
Great – we’re very pleased with their 
performance. We discuss the numbers 
in detail in my review but in summary 
we are hitting our targets on sales and 
return on investment. Clearly where we 
are up against a new competitor that 
refurbishment work is primarily focused 
on mitigating the negative effect they can 
have on us.
Are you maintaining the sales 
uplift as you work your way 
through the estate?
Carpetright has been in a nonsensical 
situation where in too many locations 
we had two Carpetright stores trading 
within close proximity to each other – 
total madness. Where we close one 
store the model sees us lose the two 
main costs, namely establishment (rent 
and rates) and people (who we nearly 
always reintegrate somewhere else in the 
region). We also see a sales transfer of 
around 40% to the remaining store and 
hey presto – you are actually now making 
a profit. Old fashioned, I know.
You will soon be approaching 
the point where half the UK 
store estate has been 
refurbished – should we see 
that as the tipping point?
Not really – the “tipping point” is when we 
see at least 75% of the units hitting their 
in-store KPIs that drive like-for-like sales 
relentlessly. You can spend a load of 
money to dress a store up beautifully but 
unless the people inside are dedicated to 
great service then you will not see a return.
Should we expect more store 
closures this year? How 
many stores do you see the 
UK having ideally?
We are at 426 stores – we are aiming to 
be below 400 in the UK this time next 
year. I don’t have an ideal number, if 
the stores are making a contribution 
we want to keep them. The numbers 
in the Netherlands and Belgium are 
about right – it’s just improving their look 
and performance.
Reducing property costs is a 
critical part of the strategy – 
how much progress was 
made in the year?
We closed 22 shops, including 7 
relocations, thereby reducing our rent 
and rates bill.  But there’s more to do and 
we’re very focused on this.
Are you looking to accelerate 
the property disposal 
programme this year?
Yes, but we will have to overcome 
significant landlord inertia. We are 
offering significant premiums to get out 
of unprofitable sites but when they have 
a tenant with a strong covenant, paying 
the rent on time every month – on a lease 
that has ten years to run – they don’t 
appear to have the appetite to find another 
tenant. I find this a rather odd call.
The Rest of Europe 
businesses continue to 
recover – will we see you 
invest in a store refurbishment 
roll out in these markets as 
you have in the UK? 
Absolutely, as I mention in my review the 
team in Utrecht has done an excellent 
job in reformatting some units that hadn’t 
had any investment since the business 
was acquired in 2002. The Netherlands 
especially will see us increase capital 
spend in the coming twelve months.
What are your priorities for the 
year ahead?
“Sticking with the knitting” is the term, 
so doing the same things – only better.
Where do you see Carpetright 
at the end of 2018?
An improved performance, with a profit 
growth and increasing market share, 
especially in hard flooring, whatever 
the economic conditions.
