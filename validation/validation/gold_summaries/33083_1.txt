Q
    Y ou have a £1.3 billion pipeline 
of developments in the UK. 
How fast can we expect to see these 
developments and how will you 
fund them? 
A
   The development pipeline can be split 
into active management projects and 
major extensions. We have several 
ongoing active management projects, 
such as the leisure extension at intu 
Potteries and the refurbishment and 
restaurant quarter at intu Victoria 
Centre, both of which will be completed 
in the second half of 2015. We will also 
be commencing three other restaurant 
projects in the next few months. All  
these projects can be funded from our 
existing facilities.
  intu W atford is our most advanced 
major extension with planning 
approved, the anchor cinema let and 
over 50 per cent of the expected rent 
under offer . We anticipate beginning 
construction this year . The catalyst for 
our other extensions, the majority of 
which have planning approved, will be 
the required level of tenant interest. 
  We should not need additional equity to 
finance these projects. We can finance 
the extensions from existing available 
facilities, raising debt against the value 
created from completed developments 
and recycling capital from other 
assets to reinvest into these growth 
opportunities, including introducing 
partners into existing assets. The major 
developments are likely to be spread 
over a number of years so the proceeds 
from financing a completed project can 
be used to help finance the next one.
Q
  Y ou have recently acquired a second 
centre in Spain. Why is Spain such 
an attractive market for you and why 
do you think you can replicate your 
strategy there? 
A
   Spain has very attractive market 
dynamics with an economy moving 
out of recession and a sophisticated 
consumer and retail market, but a 
retail sector where ownership of the 
regional shopping centre market 
remains highly fragmented and without 
a large committed pipeline of new 
centres. It is a country where we see 
major opportunities for us to broaden 
our presence and further strengthen 
our position in the market. We believe 
such expansion will be beneficial to our 
overall brand and digital positioning.
    The country holds huge potential for 
the creation of genuinely regional 
destination centres in which we 
specialise. Eighty per cent of Spain’s 
retail expenditure comes from 10 
key catchments and we aim to be the 
leading owner , developer and manager 
of regionally pre-eminent shopping 
centre destinations for a significant 
number of those key areas. 
  The acquisition of Puerto Venecia 
in early 2015, after the successful 
acquisition of Parque Principado in 2013, 
substantially accelerates our activities 
in Spain.
  We also have development options 
on sites in Málaga, Palma, V alencia 
and Vigo. It is our intention, subject to 
shareholder approval, to exercise the 
Málaga option in March 2015. We are 
advancing the other sites to the point 
where we can consider exercising 
the options. 
Q
   Y ou have had a year of negative 
like-for-like net rental income. 
What specific actions are you taking 
to address this and when can we 
expect to see a turnaround? 
A
   Over the last three years we have 
successfully repositioned the Group 
so that we are now well placed to 
benefit from the improved confidence 
of shoppers and retailers. Rather than 
chasing a target level of occupancy 
throughout this period, we have instead 
concentrated on being selective and 
ensuring that we have the right tenants 
in the right space. This means we have 
not compromised on the quality of the 
tenant mix and have maintained or 
improved the tone of the rents in our 
prime centres. 
  While our results still reflect a lingering 
impact from the administrations of late 
2012 and early 2013, it is clear that this 
active asset management strategy is 
starting to pay off . For example, in the 
case of Republic, we took back all the 
units rather than let them at potentially 
lower rents to tenants who did not fit our 
desired retail mix. It took a year , but all of 
these units are now relet to top-quality 
brands, such as Hugo Boss, White Stuff , 
Superdry and Footasylum, at rents in line 
with the previous passing rent.
Interview with the Chief Executive
Q
Intu’ s improved 2014 results 
demonstrate we are well 
positioned to benefit further 
from rising consumer confidence 
and strengthening demand 
from retailers for quality space. 
We welcome over 400 million 
customer visits per annum and 
our clear focus on delivering 
outstanding customer 
experience under the intu brand 
is proving a powerful factor in 
the successful performance 
of our centres

  The remaining elements of the like-for-
like net rental income shortfall in 2014 
can be split into two areas. First, with our 
ongoing active management projects, 
in particular at intu Victoria Centre, we 
had to remove units from generating 
income while we reconfigured the 
centre to maximise rental potential on 
completion of the project. Secondly , 
there was a concentration of lease 
expiries at intu Braehead and intu 
Potteries this year . We repositioned key 
tenants, as we illustrated last year , and 
have now addressed the majority of the 
expiries but have operated with a higher 
vacancy level in these centres as a result. 
  Like-for-like net rental income is an 
important measure, but total property 
return, the combined income and capital 
returns, encompasses everything we 
do and is the overall measure on which 
we focus. Over the past five years, our 
annualised total property return of 9.9 
per cent per annum outperformed the 
IPD UK quarterly retail benchmark of 
9.2 per cent.
Q
   intu is the only national shopping 
centre brand. What value does this 
bring and what evidence of success 
do you have two years after the 
brand was launched?
A
  Intu is one of the UK’s biggest retail 
landlords, and focused on providing 
a great experience for millions of 
UK shoppers with, according to 
our estimates, over half of the UK’s 
population visiting an intu centre 
every year .

  Our shoppers are at the heart of 
everything we do and providing 
them with compelling experiences 
also ensures that we establish 
enduring relationships with our 
retailers.  Our brand enables us to offer 
scalability to retailers and the size of 
the Group also helps to support the 
brand. Our national brand enables us 
to deliver experiences and events for 
the customer that ownership of a single 
centre could not, such as the Everyone’s 
Invited family friendly weekend of events 
in all our centres which increased footfall 
for the weekend year-on-year by around 
13 per cent.
  Our staff offer an unparalleled service 
and our digital platform gives customers 
access to brands in our centres 24 hours 
a day . Our online presence is growing 
rapidly with nearly three million visits 
to intu.co.uk in December 2014, a year-
on-year increase of almost 40 per cent. 
Our active marketing database is almost 
two million strong and in 2015 we will 
focus on developing opportunities 
for more regular engagement and, 
importantly , increased monetisation.
  Our scale as owner of nearly half of 
the top 20 shopping centres in the UK 
means that we have a strong presence 
offering key entry points in the areas 
where retailers need to be. We recognise 
that we are competing with other 
attractions, not just shopping, for our 
customers’ time and money and need 
to offer an attractive product on a 
national basis.
Q
   What are your strategic 
priorities for 2015?
A
  Our focus in 2015 will be on four 
main goals which we believe will 
result in strong total returns over the 
medium term:
 — optimising performance of existing 
assets with the delivery of like-for-like 
net rental income growth in 2015 
and attractive total property returns
 — driving forward the £1.3 billion 
investment programme in UK assets
 — making the brand count and 
demonstrating the benefits of scale
 — seizing the growth opportunity in 
Spain, building on progress in the last 
three years
