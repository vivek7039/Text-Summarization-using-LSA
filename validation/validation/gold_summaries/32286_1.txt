 Chief Executive Officer’s review
A long term business with  
a forward‑looking vision.
Kevin Bolt addresses the 2017 staff conference. 
bpha’s 2017 Financial Statements highlight that this has been an 
extremely successful year for the association, in many respects its 
best ever, which underlines the strength of the current business 
model. Naturally I am very happy with how things have gone but 
what excites me even more is the less visible, but in many ways 
more important, investment that has been made during the year 
in the association’s longer term potential.
At the moment, people seem to be getting quite used to 
unexpected events in their lives be they political, social, economic, 
national or global, so that is the world that bpha has to be strong 
enough, smart enough, resilient enough and committed enough to 
succeed in as we approach the 2020s. In short, we want the bpha 
business model to be flexible enough to cope with the unexpected 
whilst we maintain our commitment to building more homes and 
looking after the customers and homes that we already have. 
In 2016, the Board approved a strategy called ‘Fit for the Future’ 
and this year, with the help and commitment of our staff, we have 
started to deliver this. As detailed on page 7, we have established 
a new business unit operational model that has been designed 
to be both scalable and modular. It will bring greater focus and 
transparency to service delivery, the performance of our assets 
and the overall operational efficiency of the association. Ongoing 
investment in this model over the coming 12 to 24 months will 
enable bpha to continue to perform strongly and ensure we are 
able to adapt to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 
‘Housing Market’ environment of the 2020s and beyond.
We have set out in the pages that follow how we are investing in 
improvements to systems and technology and how we intend to 
deliver improvements to the customer experience whilst driving 
greater Value for Money. Fundamental to all of this are the many 
different people who play key roles within bpha. On pages 6 to 13 
we have detailed how we are investing for growth and how we are 
attracting new talent and growing our own talent. 
We are a long term business with a forward looking vision that 
states we are here: 
To build communities where people can live  
happily in a home they can afford.
Our day to day purpose or mission is that:
We will continue to build and maintain quality homes  
and thriving communities by being increasingly  
efficient and always considering those we house.
Our vision and mission will only be achieved if we have the 
ambition, strength and capability to be adaptable and resilient 
along the way. 2016/17 was a great year for the association and 
I am confident that the full value of our investment and the level of 
our achievement will only become apparent over the coming years. 
I am looking forward to our journey to the 2020s and beyond.
