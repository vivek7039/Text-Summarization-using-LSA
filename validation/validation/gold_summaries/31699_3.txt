 STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2
Another year of delivery in 2017
I am pleased to report that the Group has delivered another strong set of annual results, with 
revenue growing by 19.5% to £2,379m and underlying earnings per share increasing by 31% 
to 20.3 pence per share.
We have continued to deliver good like-for -like sales growth in our existing business, as 
well as a significant increase in net contract gains, which are strengthening our presence 
across the world. Allied to this, our strategic initiatives have delivered further operational 
improvements and margin growth.
We announced a number of important contract wins in the year, further extending our 
presence in North America and in the Rest of the World, where there are significant 
structural growth opportunities. Additionally, this year we have entered the Indian market 
through a joint venture, and the initial performance of this business has been encouraging. 
In 2017 we increased our capital expenditure to a record £115m , reflecting the strong 
increase in net contract gains. Our approach to new business is disciplined and focuses on 
ensuring that we generate good returns on investment. Our success is underpinned by our 
ability to deliver an attractive brand line-up and innovative bespoke concepts for our clients 
and customers. We continue to invest in our people, strengthening central, regional and local 
teams around the world.
Dividend
As a result of the Group’s strong performance, I am pleased to announce that the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 4.9 pence per share (subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting in February 2018), making a total dividend for the year of 8.1 pence 
per share, which is at the top end of the dividend payout ratio range we announced at the 
time of IPO. The Board also proposes a special dividend of approximately £100m which will 
be in addition to the final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2017 . This reflects our 
confidence in the future of the business and our desire to maintain an efficient balance sheet.
Sustainability
SSP continues to be committed to operating sustainably in its markets and to responsibly 
manage those environmental and social issues which have been identified as material to our 
business. We have made further good progress in the year in the priority areas as set out on 
pages 23 to 25. 
Our employees and stakeholders
The strength of the Group is principally due to our employees’ skills, experience and 
dedication. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our employees for their 
contribution during the year .
Outlook
Looking forward, we have secured some important new business wins, which means our 
pipeline is encouraging. Increasing passenger numbers around the world, both in the airport 
and rail sectors, provide significant structural growth opportunities. I am confident that 
SSP can continue to benefit from these trends and deliver sustainable value creation 
for shareholders. With this in mind, the Board looks forward to delivering another good 
performance in the year ahead.
