QUICKLY IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY  
FOLLOWING THE IPO IN 2008, OUR SAN JULIÁN MINE IS  
A FINE DEMONSTRATION OF OUR STRATEGY IN ACTION.
OVER THE LAST DECADE, THIS MINE HAS MOVED THROUGH ALL  
FOUR PILLARS OF THE BUSINESS MODEL – FROM EXPLORE,  
THROUGH DEVELOP AND INTO THE OPERATING PHASE, WHILE BEING 
SUPPORTED BY OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY THROUGHOUT.  
OUR CASE STUDIES ON PAGES 13, 27, 53 AND 73 EXPLAIN IN MORE  
DETAIL HOW SAN JULIÁN HAS EVOLVED FROM IDEA TO REALITY...  
FROM A POSSIBILITY BASED ON GEOLOGICAL EXPERTISE INTO  
A KEY PROJECT THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUTURE  
PERFORMANCE OF FRESNILLO.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Once again, we have managed our costs, 
expanded our exploration pipeline and 
achieved our production guidelines –  
all of which have combined to enable us 
to continue our track record of creating 
value through growth and returns. At  
the time of our IPO in 2008, we made  
a commitment to double production by 
2018. After nine years – a period that has 
seen a global financial crisis as well as 
volatile prices for precious metals – we 
are well on the way to confirming this 
remarkable achievement. 
Our success bears testament to the 
expertise, commitment and sheer hard 
work of our people, without whom none 
of this would have been possible. But it 
is also a tribute to the original vision of 
the Board and the strength of a strategy 
that is both effective and consistent. 
When times are challenging, it can be 
tempting to switch strategy to address 
short-term trends, for example, by 
making substantial cutbacks to areas 
such as exploration. Indeed, this is 
something that we have seen many  
of our peers do over the last decade.  
At Fresnillo, however, our strategy has 
remained constant from our first day  
of operation – and this consistency has 
been the platform for what has been a 
successful record of growth and returns.
Q – WHAT WERE THE PRODUCTION 
HEADLINES FOR THE YEAR?
A – Silver production from our mines 
reached a record level of 54.2 moz,  
due to phase I at San Julián operating 
at full capacity for the entire year and 
the start of operations of phase II at the 
same mine. Production at the Fresnillo 
mine also increased year-on-year, albeit 
at a slower pace than anticipated. We 
are continuing to implement several 
improvement measures at the mine, 
including enhanced equipment 
maintenance, the installation of a 
vertical conveyor to reduce truck 
haulage and increased supervision to 
improve the efficiency of our contractors. 
These measures, together with the 
hiring of two new contractors, will help 
us maintain development rates at the 
Fresnillo mine and improve them in  
the long run. 
As expected, gold production slightly 
decreased due to the reduction in 
inventories at Herradura in 2016 not 
being repeated to the same extent in 
2017, and a slower speed of recovery  
at Noche Buena due to a longer 
leaching process. 
Zinc production increased as a result  
of the positive contribution from San 
Julián and increased volumes produced 
at the Fresnillo mine due to the higher 
ore grades. 
Q – HOW DID PRECIOUS METALS’ PRICES 
IMPACT PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR?
A – Fresnillo’s operations are designed 
to deliver results across price cycles. 
They did so during the years when 
prices were falling – and they have done 
so again over the last 12 months, when 
prices for silver and gold have been 
largely stable. At the same time, the 
year saw a significant increase in prices 
for base metals, which are by-products 
of our silver and gold production 
processes, and this upward trend made 
a positive contribution towards our 
overall financial performance.
Our proven ability to perform in all 
price environments is important, given 
the unpredictable nature of prices. This 
ability is based on an effective strategy 
teamed with high quality execution. 
Operational excellence, targeted 
investment and disciplined cash 
management, as well as sustainable 
business practices, are the hallmarks 
of our decade-long reputation for 
achievement.
Q – LOOKING AT THE STRATEGY IN DETAIL, 
HOW DID YOU MAXIMISE THE POTENTIAL  
OF EXISTING OPERATIONS IN 2017?
A – Maximising the potential of existing 
operations is the first pillar of our 
strategy and we recorded a number  
of key achievements during the year . 
Firstly, we continued the turnaround at 
our flagship Fresnillo mine, which has  
a history that can be traced back to the 
16th century. While the mine remains 
very productive, it is nonetheless a 
mature operation – and there is an 
inevitable downward trend in grade  
as the workable veins narrow and 
weaken. Put simply, we have to invest  
in infrastructure in order to maintain 
high rates of production as we go 
deeper and incur the increased  
costs associated with greater  
haulage distances.

I am pleased to say that, despite issues 
with maintenance and contractors, 
performance at Fresnillo has improved 
year-on-year, with an upturn in 
production from 15.9 moz in 2016  
to 16.5 moz in 2017. 
At Saucito, the relatively small 
investments made in previous years 
have consolidated the mine’s position 
as the world’s largest silver producing 
mine allowing throughput to increase 
by a third, albeit reducing recoveries  
in the short term. 
We also maximised the efficiency of the 
Dynamic Leaching Plant at San Julián, 
where the drive and skills of our people 
have seen us consistently achieve 3,500 
and, at times, over 3,800 tonnes per 
day from a process that has a nominal 
design capacity of 3,000 tonnes per day.
In last year’s report I referred to a 
comprehensive review of how IT can be 
the springboard for improved efficiency. 
This initiative made significant progress 
in 2017, with several projects now in 
place and delivering results. Among 
others, these include: Ventilation Plus, 
which is now providing ventilation on 
demand at San Julián and is being 
deployed at Saucito, Fresnillo and 
Ciénega; Track Plus, which enables our 
teams to know the precise locations of 
every resource across a mine, and is  
in operation at San Julián and Saucito; 
and ProxAlarm, which improves safety 
by preventing collisions and other 
incidents involving vehicles and is  
in the process of being installed at  
all mines.

Q – HOW HAVE YOU DELIVERED GROWTH 
THROUGH DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS?
A – The construction of the San Julián 
silver and gold mine has been a hugely 
important project for Fresnillo. We 
identified the need for this project at 
the time of the IPO and it finally came 
to fruition in 2017, with the completion 
of phase II. The flotation plant was 
commissioned in July and we expect 
the mine to achieve an average annual 
production of 14.2 moz of silver and 
49.3 koz of gold. Located on the 
Chihuahua/Durango border, we believe 
that San Julián has the potential to 
become established as an entirely  
new mining district.
In addition, construction of the Pyrites 
plant has continued as planned. This 
development project will strengthen 
the Company’s production profile by 
extracting additional quantities of  
silver and gold from the historical  
and ongoing tailings at the Fresnillo 
and Saucito mines.
Construction of the second line at the 
Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura 
also continued during the year, with 
commissioning expected in the first 
half of 2018. This plant will enable 
sulphides occurring deeper in the  
pit to be processed more efficiently.

Q – HOW HAVE YOU EXTENDED THE GROWTH 
PIPELINE?
A – Our ability to fuel the pipeline has 
been one of our most notable success 
stories over the years. While some of our 
peers have neglected their exploration 
activities, our strategy has been to 
actively expand ours – and the talented 
team of over 100 Fresnillo geologists has 
enabled us to make great strides in our 
resources. From just over 1 boz of silver 
in 2008, our resources had more than 
doubled to 2.3 boz by the end of 2017, 
supported by around 1.8 m hectares  
of exploration mining concessions in 
Mexico. At the same time, our gold 
resources have increased from 12 moz  
in 2008 to 38.5 moz at the end of 2017.
We have made good progress in Peru, 
where 350,000 hectares of concessions 
have given Fresnillo the largest 
exploration portfolio in the country. We 
have identified significant opportunities 
at Pilarica and expect this to become 
our first operational mine outside 
Mexico in the medium term. We are  
also set to begin exploration in Chile, 
following three years of scouting the 
territory, and have begun a project to 
evaluate opportunities in Argentina, 
which shares some of Chile’s 
geological potential.

Q – AND HOW HAVE YOU ADVANCED  
AND ENHANCED THE SUSTAINABILITY  
OF YOUR OPERATIONS?
A – The last of our four strategic  
pillars, sustainability lies at the heart  
of everything we do at Fresnillo –  
and nothing is more important to the 
sustainability of our Company than the 
health and safety of our employees and 
contractors. Although the trend from 
2011 to 2017 is in the right direction,  
we can never be complacent, and sadly 
we have to report that we experienced 
one fatality at the beginning of the year .
We continued to strengthen our  
health and safety programmes in 2017, 
focusing on engaging contractors as 
well as our own people. Around 70% of 
our workforce of 16,000 are contractors, 
and we are working hard to align them 
fully with our health and safety culture 
and expectations. A new approach 
piloted at Saucito and subsequently 
adopted at both Fresnillo and Ciénega 
is already strengthening our safety 
culture. Under this new approach, 
which we plan to roll out across our 
other operations in the coming months, 
our people are encouraged to report 
each incident within a fixed time frame, 
no matter how minor and with a full 
description. Our safety team then 
analyses the incident and identifies  
its root cause, enabling us to more 
systematically put measures in place  
to prevent any reoccurrence. 10

Q&A WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
CONTINUED
Our promise to create value through 
growth and returns is not confined to 
our financial investors, and we were 
pleased to be included in the FTSE4 
Good Index in 2017. We work hard to 
ensure that the communities close to 
our operations also see a return on 
their investment of time, skills and 
commitments. Initiatives such as the 
Week of Health, Silver Saves Lives  
and a wide range of educational 
programmes have proved very 
successful in improving the lives and 
prospects of those who depend on us 
or are impacted by our operations.

Q – THE GOALS SET AT THE TIME OF THE 
IPO ARE ALMOST ALL NOW ACHIEVED – 
HAVE YOU SET A NEW TARGET?
A – It is cause of great satisfaction to the 
management team that we are on track 
to achieve our original production goals 
by the end of the next financial year .
We are currently in the process of 
finalising our next set of objectives,  
and these will be announced as part  
of our interim results presentation in 
August 2018.
Q – WILL THE STRATEGY CHANGE IN ORDER 
TO ACHIEVE YOUR FUTURE GOALS?
A – No, absolutely not. A proven strategy 
applied with consistency has been the 
foundation for our success to date and 
a key differentiating factor between 
ourselves and our peers. 
Despite our relative youth as a 
standalone Company, our history as a 
mining group stretches back 130 years 
– and we drew on all the experience 
gathered across those decades to 
identify and establish the principles 
that shaped our strategy. The business 
model is sound, the balance sheet 
robust and the ability to deliver results 
across all price cycles has been ably 
demonstrated.
As we move into our second decade,  
we will continue to monitor opportunities 
to complement organic growth with 
accretive mergers and acquisitions. 
However, we recognise that this can  
be a challenge. Most operations we 
evaluate from geological and financial 
perspectives fall short of the rigorous 
criteria and expectations we apply to 
Fresnillo operations.
Q – WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IN 2018?
A – While we are forecasting that all  
our operations will perform at their 
maximum levels, we nonetheless 
anticipate a challenging year in 2018. 
Inflationary pressures are likely to 
increase and it is unclear whether 
precious metals prices have already 
bottomed out or may drift lower . In 
addition, 2018 is an election year in 
Mexico and this will doubtless bring  
an unwelcome degree of volatility to 
exchange rates.
However, that said, our people  
have worked successfully in similar 
market environments before and will 
undoubtedly do so again. We expect 
continued growth through exploration 
and development, together with 
increased production at San Julián, 
further improvements in performance 
at Fresnillo, completion of the new 
Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura 
and the commissioning of the new 
Pyrites plant at Saucito.
These projects will lead to increased 
production with associated costs, 
though we will continue to seek 
corresponding efficiencies from other 
operations. A strong balance sheet, 
targeted investment and operating 
costs amongst the lowest in the 
industry, will again be the defining 
characteristics of our Company. In 
particular, I look forward to our project 
at Juanicipio moving from exploration 
to the development stage, subject to 
Board approval in April 2018. 
Our new approach to health and safety 
is set to be rolled out to all mines,  
and this should lead to an improved 
system that will benefit all employees 
and contractors.
In conclusion, I would like to thank  
our people, communities, suppliers, 
clients and shareholders for their 
continued support during the last year . 
Together, we face the future with 
cautious confidence.
