 GOOCH & HOUSEGO PLC
10  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
Set against a backdrop of favourable market conditions, your 
company has delivered a strong financial performance in 2017. 
This has been delivered through a mix of organic and 
acquisitive growth.
Demand for certain of Gooch & Housego’s products, particularly 
from the microelectronics and undersea fibre optic 
communications sectors, reached unprecedented levels during 
the year. The resulting record order book presented a significant 
challenge for some of the Company’s manufacturing operations. 
Investments made in recent years in “lean manufacturing” and 
“continuous improvement” meant that G&H was in part able to 
respond to this demand through an enhanced ability to match 
capacity with demand across the Company’s various 
manufacturing locations. Combined with significant investments 
during the year in people, and in the latest manufacturing 
equipment, these initiatives made it possible to satisfy the needs 
of our customers and begin to reduce lead times towards the 
year-end.
In February 2017 G&H acquired StingRay Optics LLC (StingRay), 
a USA based designer and manufacturer of specialist optical and 
opto-mechanical systems. StingRay was a particularly significant 
acquisition as it provides G&H with advanced optical systems 
design capabilities for harsh and demanding applications. These 
new capabilities support the Company’s twin strategic objectives 
of moving up the value chain and achieving greater diversification 
by enabling G&H to provide systems-level solutions to 
Aerospace & Defence (“A&D”) customers. In 2017 the StingRay 
acquisition helped sales into the A&D sector approach one third 
of total revenues. StingRay has delivered a consistently strong 
performance since acquisition. The acquisitions completed in the 
previous year (Alfalight and Kent Periscopes) also made valuable 
contributions in 2017.
The investment in people during 2017 represents an important 
enhancement of the skills-base of G&H, and bodes well for the 
future. In order to meet the challenges of greater scale and 
complexity G&H has chosen to focus on specific high growth 
products and markets. Recent recruitment has reflected the 
need for a higher level of specialisation across a wide range of 
business functions including manufacturing processes and 
systems, business development, human resources, supply-chain 
and research and development. These and planned future 
changes reflect a recent board review of the organisational 
structure of the G&H that had the objective of ensuring that it 
be optimised for delivering sustainable growth over the long 
term, as G&H grows both organically and by acquisition.
In successfully responding to the challenges of 2017 an 
exceptional effort was required by many people. I would like to 
express my thanks to my fellow directors and to all employees of 
Gooch & Housego. I am pleased to welcome David Bauernfeind, 
who joined the board as a non-executive director and Chair of 
the Audit Committee on 1 May 2017.
Gooch & Housego is stronger today than at any time in its past. 
With a sound financial foundation, new talents and capabilities, 
a pipeline of exciting new products and a record order book to 
start the year the Company is well-positioned to continue to 
deliver in 2018 and beyond.
