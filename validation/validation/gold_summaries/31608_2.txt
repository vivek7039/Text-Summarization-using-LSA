Diploma PLC uses alternative performance measures 
as key financial indicators to assess the underlying 
performance of the Group. These include adjusted 
operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted 
earnings per share, free cash flow, trading capital 
employed and return on adjusted trading capital 
employed (“ROATCE”). All references in this Annual 
Report & Accounts to “underlying” revenues or 
operating profits refer to reported results on a 
constant currency basis and before any contributions 
from acquired or disposed businesses. The narrative 
in the Annual Report & Accounts is based on these 
alternative measures and an explanation is set out 
in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the Annual Report & Accounts.
