ASSURANCE DIVISION OVERVIEW
The Assurance Division operates in two 
discreet segments as described below.
Security consulting
The cyber landscape presents an ever 
increasing and ever changing threat 
to security as cyber intruders develop 
increasingly sophisticated ways to attack 
corporate networks, thereby gaining 
access to organisations’ sensitive and 
valuable data and systems.
The Assurance Division brings together 
a number of diverse product and service 
offerings in a number of different 
business lines. The “golden thread” 
running through the core businesses is 
“cyber security” – whether through the 
provision of consulting and professional 
services, managed services or hardware 
and software products. These core areas 
all focus on cyber security – in other 
words – how to maintain and protect our 
customers’ data and critical business 
systems from interruption by malicious 
or accidental events. 
Information security and cyber security 
continue to change at a rapid pace with 
new areas of concern or vulnerabilities 
frequently and regularly discovered. To 
stay ahead in the cyber-arms race, our 
global corporate culture is aligned with 
this rapid and constant change. We have 
created boutique ways of working with 
cultural values that encourage individuals 
to fulfil their full creative potential.
In conjunction with this creativity, the 
business is committed to listening to 
its clients’ requirements. Since much 
of the work carried out by the Group is 
research based, in order to maintain its 
equitable and ethical disclosure policies, 
research paid for by third parties and 
customers is not disclosed, unless 
requested by the paying organisation. 
Self-funded research by the Group will 
always be provided to the organisation 
that it affects in full, free of charge and 
without disclosure, until such time as 
the vulnerability has been resolved in 
a reasonable timeframe. This does not 
preclude the Group making a full public 
disclosure if there is a threat to life or to 
the general public’s online security, and 
the third party is unwilling to remediate 
the issue.
Historically, Assurance Division 
acquisitions have been based upon 
culture, fit and service but never on the 
basis of profit enhancement by cost 
reduction or the ability to turn around 
an ailing business. Threat intelligence 
and cryptography is the most recent 
example of this, where the Group 
acquired a business, Fox-IT, to fill directly 
a product and service need. While 
progress in rolling these services out to 
a much broader range of multinational 
customers has been much slower than 
expected, the opportunity remains an 
attractive one if we can reorganise 
ourselves effectively to deliver on it. 
Threat intelligence is one of the most 
important tools in an organisation’s 
armoury to help prevent and mitigate 
cyber-attack.
Our future acquisition strategy will 
be reviewed and developed after 
a necessary period of stabilisation 
and rebuilding of strong foundations 
in scalable business systems and 
processes.
Following the acquisition of Accumuli plc, 
the Group has the opportunity to offer 
an integrated managed scanning service 
as a single client solution (hence now 
referred to as MSS). A project is also 
underway to put all of our internal and 
external monitoring services on to the 
“CTMp” platform acquired with Fox-IT. 
While the Group will continue to be open 
to the sale of third party products, our 
focus will be on instances where we can 
offer value added after sales services. 
Not all of the Group’s sales of products 
are third party products. Particularly 
through the Fox business, we offer some 
very high-end products to customers 
that combine hardware and software in 
one package. This includes “DetACT” 
(for use by transactional financial 
services companies) and Data Diodes 
(a product range that helps secure 
one-way data communications such 
as a utility meter). Both products are 
sufficiently differentiated that they can 
attract better margins than third party 
product reselling.
As one of the world’s largest service 
led security consultancies, the Group is 
capable of leading all cyber security bids 
rather than having to look for support 
from larger third parties. 
Software testing and 
website performance
Essential websites, software and 
infrastructure that support an 
organisation do not just need protection 
from malicious attacks, they also need 
guaranteed performance levels. Flaws 
in code can prevent software from 
operating at optimum levels and spikes 
in online traffic can throw websites 
offline. Currently, NCC Group undertakes 
more than three million web page tests 
per day for clients worldwide.

ESCROW
Escrow background 
The Escrow Division offers a high 
value product to customers who rely 
on mission critical applications and 
software packages for the day-to-day 
running of their business functions and 
processes. In today’s integrated business 
world, these applications typically extend 
well beyond accounting and reporting 
systems into Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) tools and even deeper 
into an organisation’s service delivery 
capability such as design tools in an 
advertising agency or manufacturing 
equipment in an engineering company.
These applications are often supplied 
by third party vendors. However, if a 
software or Software as a Service 
(SaaS) supplier goes out of business 
and/or changes hands, the continuing 
availability of these applications could be 
in doubt and hence business continuity 
is potentially put at risk.
NCC Group’s escrow and verification 
services assure the long-term availability 
of these applications, protecting both 
end users and software suppliers. 
Working with all parties involved in 
the development, supply and use of 
business critical software applications, 
NCC Group assures that source code, 
data and other information is constantly 
accessible and can be properly rebuilt 
from its components, if required.
Core services
Both through contractual arrangements 
and through verification testing services, 
Escrow’s service offering is to provide 
a safe and independent environment 
in which customers and their software 
suppliers can entrust NCC Group with 
source code that will allow continued 
access to key systems in the event of an 
interruption in supply.

The potential benefits include the 
continued operation of the customers’ 
core business systems at a relatively low 
cost. Escrow services are provided in both 
the traditional software market as well as 
in all iterations of the outsourced model. 
We continue to develop our SaaS service 
to respond to the continuing evolution of 
our marketplace, as well as developing 
server testing services in order to 
enhance the proposition.
Further, we provide registry data escrow 
services (a regulatory requirement) for all 
registrars and registries of domains. The 
IP address of each domain registered 
within a TLD is safely secured along with 
Registrar Data Escrow.
Due to its importance to clients, Escrow 
provides the Group with excellent 
recurring revenues along with good 
margins and cash generation. Escrow 
can be provided both in the traditional 
on-premise software market as well as 
in the cloud, as the basic underpinnings 
are the same; protection from an event 
that disrupts the relationship between 
the owner and licensee of a software 
product.
The Escrow Division remains a key 
cornerstone of the Group and is the 
platform upon which the organisation 
has been built. The fundamentals of 
the Group are fully encapsulated in this 
division, which is based around the very 
highest standards of customer care and 
equitable treatment to all parties in the 
contractual relationship. 
While there are limited cross linkages 
or shared sales opportunities with 
the Assurance Division, Escrow does 
offer services that complement those 
in Assurance to protect customers 
against the full range of cyber risks. 
A good example of this has been the 
development of offering SAST (static 
application security testing) services to 
software vendors on source code that 
has been deposited and verified with the 
Group’s Escrow Division.
The Group is one of the world’s leading 
and most established software escrow 
providers, with more than 35 years’ 
experience and protects over 15,000 
organisations worldwide, combining 
longevity and trust with technical 
expertise. The expertise contained 
within the Escrow Division, along with its 
credentials, offerings, global scale and 
reputation, sets NCC Group apart from 
other escrow providers.
