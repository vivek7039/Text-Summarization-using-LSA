 2017 was a challenging year for Centrica. 
Our performance in the second half was weak, 
particularly in Business energy supply. 
Group Chief 
Executive’s Statement
This, combined with uncertainty around 
our future prospects in UK energy supply, 
significantly amplified by the Prime Minister’s 
announcement in October that the UK 
Government would pursue a market-wide 
price cap of the Standard Variable Tariff (SVT) 
and other default tariffs, resulted in a 
significant fall in our share price in 2017 , 
particularly over the fourth quarter. 
Some of the drivers were clearly beyond our 
control. But clearly we regret the outcome 
and the impact it has had on our shareholders 
and on our employees. I am determined to 
restore shareholder value and confidence. 
The underlying trends driving our strategy 
are clear, as are the distinctive capabilities 
we have to benefit from them. We are 
committed to delivering attractive returns 
and growth over the medium term. Our focus 
today is on performance delivery and financial 
discipline – on demonstrating top line growth 
as we deliver improved service and new 
propositions for our customers, and driving 
efficiency as hard as possible to underpin 
our competitiveness.
Although we delivered our 2017 published 
targets in terms of operating cash flow, cost 
efficiency and headcount reduction, capital 
discipline and net debt, our financial results 
were disappointing. Adjusted operating profit 
at £1.25 billion was down 17%, earnings 
were down 22%, at £698 million, equivalent 
to 12.6 pence per share. Adjusted operating 
cash flow was £2.07 billion. EBITDA of 
£2.14 billion was down 9%.
We delivered a disappointing result in our 
North America Business operation. This 
was both in terms of the performance of 
our power supply book and from a charge 
relating to historical revenue recognition 
in one of our billing systems going back to 
2013. Performance in UK Business energy 
supply was also poor. Adjusted operating 
profit for Centrica Business as a whole was 
down 67%. 
However, Centrica Consumer delivered 
robust performance with adjusted operating 
profit down only 1% despite the impacts of 
warm weather, the UK Government pre-
payment tariff cap, competitive intensity 
and investing for growth.
Despite the setbacks, the foundations of our 
businesses remain strong. We believe our 
business model is – and will continue to be – 
resilient, even under the pressures we face. 
Our strategy is clear. It is founded on an 
analysis of market trends and sources of 
growth, on our own capabilities and the 
efficiency necessary to pursue them profitably.
Centrica is an energy and services company. 
Our purpose is ‘to provide energy and 
services to satisfy the changing needs of our 
customers’. This is the core of the Company 
and we have been supplying energy and 
services to customers since 1812. We are 
re-emphasising and returning to that core. 
However, it is not 1812, the needs of 
customers are indeed changing, and as 
we deliver for them the propositions we 
offer must change too.
Globally, the energy system is becoming 
more decentralised, customers are 
becoming more powerful because of 
increased choice, and technology is 
accelerating the pace of change. These 
trends, which we identified when we 
launched our new strategy in 2015, are even 
clearer today and are playing out in line with 
our views at the time. We are in step with 
where the energy world is going and the 
services which our customers desire. We 
do not believe that anything has happened 
since 2015 to invalidate our strategy or the 
core strengths of the Company.
As a result, Centrica is focusing more 
investment on the customer-facing 
businesses. We are also becoming simpler 
as an organisation. We now have only three 
divisions, Centrica Consumer, Centrica 
Business and Exploration & Production 
(E&P). Each has a clear participation strategy 
and strategic framework. The reason we have 
established Group-wide Consumer and 
Business divisions is that we have found 
that customer needs are very similar globally, 
and they are seeking more than simply 
energy supply.
Our focus today is on 
performance delivery 
and financial discipline 
– on demonstrating top 
line growth as we deliver 
improved service and 
new propositions for our 
customers and driving 
efficiency as hard as 
possible to underpin 
our competitiveness.

6 | Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive’s Statement What we are doing is not a radical departure 
from our roots; it is a natural extension 
of who we are and what we are good at. 
Through installing boilers, heating systems 
and their controllers we have always been 
in the ‘home energy management’ business. 
Our development of Hive, starting with the 
digital thermostat and the intelligent boiler, 
is the next phase in the evolution of home 
energy management and a direct extension 
of our in-home services business. 
We are finding that consumers want these 
propositions and are willing to pay for them. 
We are also finding that many customers 
value receiving these services from the same 
provider as their energy supply. The same 
principles apply to our business customers. 
The new propositions and services we have 
developed are not a distraction or somehow 
unrelated to our legacy businesses. They are 
at the heart of what our legacy offerings have 
to incorporate and what the most valuable 
customer segments are demanding.
In our Consumer division, revenues have 
been stable and unit gross margins are 
attractive. We did see a fall of 1.35 million 
customer accounts during 2017 . We have 
made active choices on which channels 
and customer segments we are seeking 
to engage, retain and serve. We do not like 
losing any customers but most of these 
customer accounts generated very low 
gross margin and were loss-making at the 
operating profit level.
In contrast, while we have seen some losses 
in higher value accounts, in 2017 we were 
successful in encouraging a net approximately 
700,000 UK energy accounts from the 
SVT to our fixed-term tariffs. We have seen 
material growth in new services and 
relationships. We saw 18% growth in 
protection plans in the US. In Connected 
Home we saw cumulative installed hubs 
grow by 71% to 900,000 over 2017 . We 
exceeded our target of 1.5 million products 
sold. Connected Home continues to grow 
in all of our energy supply geographies, and 
our first international partnership with Eni 
gas e luce in Italy will see its full commercial 
launch in April.
Our Local Heroes scheme has grown rapidly 
from its launch at the beginning of last year. 
We now have 7 ,000 tradespeople signed 
up, backed by our guarantee, and we have 
now completed over 25,000 jobs. This on-
demand offer continues to accelerate and it 
complements our own contract relationships 
through British Gas.
We have also seen the number of British Gas 
services accounts deliver the first year of 
stability since 2010. Accounts grew by 
77 ,000 in the second half, reversing the fall 
we saw in the first half. In addition, 700,000 
customers have so far signed up for British 
Gas Rewards, enabling us to enhance 
the relationship and proposition for our 
loyal customers in combination with our 
other offers.
In our customer businesses, our goal is to 
focus on value, not volume, retaining and 
engaging our customers while continuing 
to drive costs down to maintain margins. 
This is what we will concentrate on across 
the Centrica Consumer portfolio as we 
extend the propositions we can offer our 
customers with the goal also to stabilise and 
grow the total number of relationships we 
have. We believe we can continue to make 
progress, even in the face of further price 
regulation in the UK.
As we have made clear, we do not support 
price controls in competitive retail energy 
markets and we believe they will not 
ultimately benefit customers. We believe 
price caps will reduce competition and 
choice, and prices tend to ultimately 
converge around the cap level. Instead, 
to improve the market our focus is on 
increasing customer engagement, driving 
cost efficiency, improving service levels, 
on rewarding loyalty and on delivering 
propositions that customers want.
Last year, we announced a package of 
actions and proposed measures to reform 
the UK energy market for the long term and 
really benefit customers, without the need for 
price controls. At its heart are our decision to 
withdraw the British Gas SVT and our call for 
the UK Government and the regulator to ban 
this sort of rolling tariff across the industry. 
We will introduce new, attractive fixed-term 
propositions including fixed-price, online only 
and bundled tariffs. We will introduce a new 
default tariff and increase choice to try to 
avoid people going onto a default tariff in the 
first place. Allied to a greater range of choice 
for customers and simpler bills, we think 
these measures will be far more effective 
in improving the market for customers than 
any price caps.
However, given the prospect of default tariff 
cap legislation we are taking a number of 
steps to reduce our relative exposure to price 
caps and their impact on Centrica. We will 
reduce our exposure to a cap, using our 
recent efficiency to continue to price 
competitively and to drive further cost 
reductions. We had 4.3 million customers 
on SVTs at the end of 2017 and we expect 
to reduce this to 3 million by the end of this 
year as the measures described above take 
effect. Secondly, as a result of our own cost 
efficiencies and other actions to date, 
our current SVT is cheaper than 85% of 
the market and is £41 a year below the 
average SVT of the large suppliers. Thirdly, 
our efficiency programme will deliver an 
additional estimated saving of £20 per dual 
fuel customer by 2020.
Taking all of this together, and recognising 
that the formula for any potential cap is not 
yet known, we believe that we can deliver 
a sustainable energy supply business in 
the UK with healthy returns under most 
conceivable scenarios.
Turning to Centrica Business, we have 
continued to develop our business across 
the five pillars of our divisional strategic 
framework. We find that in addition to the 
commodity offerings of energy supply and 
energy wholesale, business customers 
want access to more distributed energy 
generation solutions, and we are moving 
from building large central power generation 
plants to many smaller distributed units. 
Our customers want combined heat and 
power units, solar arrays and the grid 
operators want distributed power systems 
and technology to assist with the optimisation 
of local energy markets and micro-grids. 
Along with this, customers want to be able 
to gain insight from their energy use to save 
money and improve their operations, 
including in preventative maintenance. 
Customers who have distributed energy 
assets want to be able to optimise them 
and are willing to pay for optimisation 
services rather than do it themselves.
We have responded to these needs by 
developing capabilities in all of these areas, 
both organically and through targeted 
acquisitions of Panoramic Power, ENER-G 
Cogen, Neas Energy and REstore. We have 
also expanded our distribution and sales 
capability and built a new marketing platform 
for business customers under the brand 
Centrica Business Solutions.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 | 7 We have also disposed of our large gas fired 
generation plants and our two large wind 
farms and continued to shift our portfolio to 
more distributed assets. We have converted 
some sites to peaking plant and have several 
projects underway to build new gas fired 
rapid response generation sites, as well as 
constructing a battery storage facility which 
is one of the largest in Europe. We also aim 
to divest our shareholding in UK nuclear 
power. Subject to ensuring alignment with 
our partner, and being very mindful of UK 
Government interests in this area, we would 
hope to achieve this by the end of 2020.
The business customer is also on the 
move and we are responding to their needs. 
They want more than just commodity 
energy supply, and the new capabilities 
and propositions we have developed once 
again reinforce the core of the relationship. 
The returns in value-added services tend 
to be higher than in pure commodity 
energy supply.
The big message, therefore, whether in 
Centrica Consumer or Centrica Business, 
is that the new propositions and services 
we have developed are at the heart of what 
Centrica’s core offerings in energy and 
services now have to incorporate. They are 
at the heart of what important and valuable 
customer segments are demanding. 
Centrica has now developed the capabilities 
to offer them in a high-quality way. We are 
seeing improvements in the customer 
experience and the growth in demand 
is feeding through to revenues and at 
attractive margins.
Since we embarked on our new strategic 
direction we have made a number of 
acquisitions to provide the key capabilities 
we did not already have in-house. These 
acquisitions have all met, and in some 
cases exceeded, our expectations. We have 
widened the footprint of the Group beyond 
the UK and North America to serve 
customers in 40 countries. However, in the 
last three months of 2017 the risk envelope 
for Centrica changed, and as a result, we will 
not be pursuing growth through major M&A 
activities. This is because the uncertainty 
over the UK price cap is too great and we 
wish to maintain our hard-fought balance 
sheet strength. We will, however, continue 
to pursue smaller bolt-on acquisitions to 
build capability in key areas.
In our asset businesses we have made 
divestments of over £900 million – towards 
the top of our target range – and reduced 
capital investment into them. Last year, 
we combined our E&P operations with 
Bayerngas Norge AS, and the new business, 
Spirit Energy – in which we hold a 69% stake 
– began trading as an independent oil and 
gas operator. Our goal is to make Spirit 
Energy stronger and more sustainable and 
we will now target further consolidation. We 
would be open to having a lower ownership 
percentage in a larger entity, provided our net 
E&P exposure remains broadly unchanged 
and we retain sufficient influence to shape 
the strategic direction of the business. We 
would therefore also be prepared to own less 
than 50% of Spirit Energy if the right 
opportunity came along.
We also concluded that our Rough storage 
asset was no longer capable of safe injection 
operations due to its age and condition and 
that, because of the economics of seasonal 
storage and the cost of refurbishing or 
rebuilding the facility, neither pathway would 
be economic. We therefore decided that we 
can no longer operate Rough as a storage 
facility and have now received all relevant 
consents and approvals to extract the 
recoverable gas from the reservoir. In the 
past, Rough has made a vital contribution 
to the nation’s security of supply. But today, 
the UK is fortunate in benefiting from a 
diverse range of energy sources. 
Centrica is halfway through a six-year strategic 
repositioning of the Company and I would 
now like to summarise what has been 
delivered during the first phase since 2015. 
We have continued our reallocation of 
resources away from the asset businesses 
towards our customer-facing activities. We 
have made divestments of over £900 million 
and reduced capital allocation to E&P by 
£300 million per annum while investing an 
additional £700 million across 2016 and 2017 
in the customer-facing businesses. This has 
enhanced our capabilities and technologies, 
leaving us well positioned to capitalise on 
consumer trends.
We have been successful in reducing costs. 
We have delivered our £750 million cost 
efficiency programme three years early. 
We have also set out plans for further 
significant cost reductions, totalling an 
additional £500 million a year by 2020, which 
will release more savings to support our aim 
of becoming the most efficient price setter 
for our chosen propositions and brands.
We have reduced our net debt to less than 
£2.6 billion, in the lower half of our target end 
2017 band, and our credit metrics are at levels 
currently required for the strong investment-
grade credit ratings that we aim for. 
As we look forward to 2018/20, although 
we have still got some portfolio development 
to complete, the focus is on performance 
delivery and financial discipline. In 
performance terms, it is about growing 
gross margin through our customer 
relationships, and driving the next phase 
of cost efficiency. We will also be focusing 
on improving organisational effectiveness 
and securing the capabilities we need in 
2020 and beyond. We must do all of this 
while continuing to deliver improvements 
in safety, compliance and conduct and in 
operational excellence across the Company, 
starting with customer service.

Page 45 We will be targeting delivery, on average, 
of £2.1–£2.3 billion of adjusted operating 
cash flow per annum. We believe this is 
deliverable, even taking into account a 
potential price cap, for the reasons outlined 
earlier. But there remains a risk that a 
particularly severe cap impact in the first 
year may put this target at risk for 2019. 
As we continue to focus on financial 
discipline we will be limiting capex to no 
more than £1.2 billion per annum and 
targeting to maintain net debt within a 
£2.25–£3.25 billion range. Despite current 
pressures, we expect to continue to be able 
to balance sources and uses of cash in 2018, 
without materially affecting our ability to 
invest in the business and deliver on all 
aspects of our financial framework.
In terms of the dividend, we have indicated 
since 2015 that it would be linked to operating 
cash flow and we expect to maintain the 
current level of the dividend over the period 
2018/20, subject to meeting our adjusted 
operating cash flow and net debt targets. 
We believe we can manage within both these 
constraints under most scenarios based on 
our current projections, but clearly, there are 
always risks associated with extremes of 
commodity price movements and regulatory 
interventions. We would intend to restore a 
progressive dividend only when, in addition 
to the criteria already mentioned, underlying 
cash flow growth capability is demonstrated. 
The transformation of Centrica is also about 
the values which guide us as we go about 
our daily business. In 2017 we launched a 
new set of Group-wide values – ‘our Values’ 
of Care, Collaboration, Courage, Delivery 
and Agility – and in January this year we 
launched ‘Our Code’, which replaces the 
Business Principles and other codes of 
conduct within the Group. We wanted 
a clear, unified statement of the most 
important principles and expectations which 
apply to all of us. In essence, ‘our Values’ 
and ‘Our Code’ embody what we stand for. 
We hope that they will help all of us at 
Centrica make the right decisions.
The transition we are making has not been 
easy for our team. Our people have faced, 
and will continue to face, a number of new 
challenges. But they have shown extraordinary 
resilience, passion, commitment and talent, 
and I would like to thank each of them for all 
their contributions over the past year.
The first phase of our strategic repositioning 
is complete. We have strengthened the 
balance sheet, paid down debt, matched 
our sources and uses of cash, and refocused 
resources and capability towards the 
customer. But we are only halfway through 
a six-year repositioning and we must stay 
the course. 
The next phase to 2020 is all about 
performance delivery and financial discipline, 
as we marry customer-led gross margin 
growth with continuing to drive material 
levels of cost efficiency while maintaining 
capital discipline and a strong balance sheet. 
It is this combination, our track record to 
date and an excellent and committed team 
which give us confidence to pursue our 
medium-term goals of delivering growth 
and returns through satisfying the changing 
needs of our customers, deal with the 
uncertainties posed by any default tariff 
cap in the UK and indicate a stable dividend 
outlook within defined boundary conditions.
It is undeniable that at present Centrica 
faces a higher level of external uncertainty. 
It is therefore imperative that we focus 
on the things we can control to underpin 
our performance.
This is how we will rebuild shareholder 
value and confidence, and I am determined 
to demonstrate this through our actions, 
one step at a time.
