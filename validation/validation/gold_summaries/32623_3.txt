CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE GROUP 
CONTINUES TO MAKE GOOD PROGRESS AND 
HAS DELIVERED ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT 
INCREASE IN UNDERLYING PROFITABILITY. 
OVERVIEW
I am pleased to report that the Group continues to make good progress 
and has delivered another significant increase in underlying profitability. 
This result was achieved despite the impact of the flood suffered at 
our fabric printing factory, Standfast & Barracks, in December 2015 
and reflects the success of our continued strategic focus on developing 
our product offering, international expansion, market penetration, 
lifestyle product extension and investment in manufacturing.
It also reflects an initial contribution from the acquisition in October 
2016 of Clarke & Clarke, a fabrics and wallcoverings business with two 
international brands, Clarke & Clarke and Studio G. This acquisition 
continues to trade in line with the Board’s expectations and is expected 
to make a material contribution to earnings during the current financial 
year ending 31 January 2018. We continue to seek further acquisitions 
to complement our organic growth initiatives. 
We were very pleased with the support from both new and existing 
investors for the equity fundraising of £17.0 million as part-funding for 
the acquisition of Clarke & Clarke. 
The adjusted underlying profit before tax for the year, excluding the 
LTIP accounting charge and the net defined benefit charge, was 
£10.4 million (2016: £8.9 million), an increase of 16.9%. The reported 
financial results include a first-time contribution from Clarke & Clarke  
of £1.0 million. 
The Group’s results were impacted by the flood in December 2015 at 
Standfast & Barracks, though the financial impact has been mitigated 
by the Group’s comprehensive insurance policy. The results include £2.8 
million as a result of interim insurance payments for loss of profits. 
To date, the Group has received a total of £16.9 million of flood-related 
insurance payments in respect of damage to business assets, 
reimbursement of cleaning costs and loss of profits. As previously 
announced, we will be seeking to negotiate a final settlement of the 
insurance claim with our insurers and anticipate that a settlement will 
be agreed in the first half of the current financial year. 
The flood halted production at Standfast & Barracks for a period of 16 
weeks, thereby removing the Group’s internal capacity to print fabric for 
its own Brands and third party customers. Full production was restored 
in October 2016 and the Brands were fully restocked by the financial 
year end.
Total Brand sales, which include Clarke & Clarke, were up 12.8% during 
the year to £76.6 million, including sales of £7.3 million from the first 
18 weeks’ ownership of Clarke & Clarke. Like-for-like sales are down due 
to the flood. The impact of this has been mitigated by insurance 
reimbursement. 
Excluding Clarke & Clarke, total Brand sales for the year were up 2.2% 
compared with the same period last year, to £69.3 million. In the UK, 
our largest market, sales were down by 4.0% to £38.4 million, reflecting 
the impact of the flood. Overseas Brand sales were up 10.0% in 
reportable currency, up 0.5% in constant currency. Sales in the US, the 
Group’s second largest market, were up 8.3% in reportable currency, 
down 5.2% in constant currency. In Western Europe, our third largest  A WARM WELCOME TO FIONA HOLMES,

market, Brand sales were up 22.4% in reportable currency, up 7.9% in 
constant currency, with strong sales growth in most regions. Sales in the 
Rest of the World grew 0.3% in constant currency. 
During the year we have continued to develop our product offering. 
We have been pleased with the performance of our Woodland Walk 
collection from Sanderson, which has been its best-selling collection for 
several years, and the success of Morris & Co. Pure, a range of classic 
William Morris designs produced for the first time in neutral colours. 
We are particularly pleased with licensing income of £2.6 million, which 
was up 25.6% in reportable currency, up 13.1 % in constant currency. 
We are continuing to pursue the extension of our product offering 
through new licensing agreements to take the Company’s Brands 
further into new lifestyle products and geographical territories. We are 
excited about the future potential for this important contributor to our 
growth strategy.
Walker Greenbank’s vertically integrated high-quality UK 
manufacturing base, comprising our Loughborough-based wallpaper 
printing business, Anstey Wallpaper Company, and Lancaster-based 
fabric printing business Standfast & Barracks, differentiates us from 
others in our industry.
The flood at Standfast & Barracks resulted in reduced sales and 
profitability, with total Manufacturing sales down 6.7% compared with 
the same period last year. The insurance-funded replacement of 
flood-damaged printing equipment means that the factory is now 
operating with the latest machinery, increasing our production capacity 
and capabilities.
FINANCIALS 
Total sales increased 5.2% to £92.4 million (2016: £87.8 million) 
including Clarke & Clarke sales of £7.3 million.
Although statutory profit from operations is down 3.7% to £7.9 million 
(2016: £8.2 million) due to acquisition, restructuring and reorganisation 
costs, the underlying profit from operations has increased 19.5% to 
£9.8 million (2016: £8.2 million). 
The total statutory profit after tax was £5.4 million (2016: £5.9 million), 
and basic adjusted earnings per share were up 14.6% after removing 
the LTIP accounting charge, net defined benefit charge and non-
underlying items.
DIVIDEND
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 3.06p per 
share (2016: 2.45p), which will be payable on 11 August 2017 to 
shareholders on the register on 21 July 2017. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 3.61p per share (2016: 2.89p) an increase of 
24.9%, reflecting the Board’s confidence in the future prospects and 
the financial strength of the Group.

PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our management 
and employees for their contribution to another successful year. 
I was delighted to welcome Fiona Holmes to the Walker Greenbank 
Board as Managing Director of Brands during the year. Fiona brings a 
wealth of brand, digital and multi-channel retail experience to the 
Company. I would like to say a particular thank you to Fiona’s 
predecessor, David Smallridge, for his invaluable contribution during his 
15 years of service. I would also like to thank all of the team members 
at Standfast & Barracks for their huge part in bringing the factory back 
to full production.
During the year, we continued to strengthen the operational 
management and organisational structure of the Group, including the 
appointment of an MD of Manufacturing and a Group HR Director.
OUTLOOK 
We began the new financial year with Standfast & Barracks back to full 
production capacity and our warehouse fully restocked, giving us a 
strong platform for the year ahead. In addition, we are excited by our 
recent acquisition of Clarke & Clarke, which marks the next step in our 
growth strategy. 
Brand sales in the first quarter are on an improving trend, though they 
continue to reflect the flood-constrained product launches in the spring 
of last year and partially constrained autumn launches. Consequential 
loss of profits continue to be mitigated by our insurance policy though, 
as we look ahead, the flood’s impact on trading will be reduced. In 
the first 12 weeks of the current financial year, Brands sales were up 
4.4% in reportable currency and up 0.9% in constant currency. Brands 
sales exclude Clarke & Clarke, which is trading in line with the Board’s 
expectations and is an exciting addition to our product portfolio. 
Sales in the year ahead are expected to benefit from the new 
collections launched this spring, from the continued momentum of our 
licensing activities and from the significant contribution from Clarke & 
Clarke. With this backdrop, we remain confident in meeting the Board’s 
expectations for the current financial year.
