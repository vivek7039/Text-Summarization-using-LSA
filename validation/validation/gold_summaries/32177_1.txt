Chief Executive’s  
review
We continued to make very strong 
progress at 3i in FY2017 . Our ﬁnancial 
results were excellent and underpinned 
by strong fundamentals. 
Our Private Equity investment portfolio 
has undergone a major transformation 
over the last ﬁve years as we have sold 
many of the weaker, legacy assets and 
made new investments in good quality 
companies at attractive prices.
Our Infrastructure team has also been 
busy and assembled a sizeable economic 
infrastructure portfolio for 3i Infrastructure 
plc (“3iN”), as well as pursuing a number 
of new initiatives to broaden our 
investment capability.
We sold our Debt Management business 
for £270 million during the year, as we were 
not conﬁdent that this business would 
meet our return requirements and justify 
its relative complexity in a more onerous 
regulatory environment in the future.
A measure of the success of these changes 
can be seen in this year’s ﬁnancial results;  
3i generated a total return on shareholders’ 
funds of £1,592 million, or 36% (2016: £824 
million, or 22%), ending the year with a 
NAV per share of 604 pence (31 March 
2016: 463 pence). Our results include the 
beneﬁt of currency movements; 71% of 
the Group’s assets are denominated in 
euros or US dollars and we generated a 
£297 million gain (2016: £143 million gain) 
from the weakness of sterling in the year. 
Cash realisations, including the proceeds 
from the sale of Debt Management, were 
strong at £1,308 million and we saw a good 
step forward in cash investment to £638 
million. We ﬁnished the year with net cash 
of £419 million (31 March 2016: £165 million) 
and have announced a further good lift in 
the pay out to shareholders.
A high quality Private Equity 
investment portfolio
Our plan with new Private Equity 
investments is simple, but the execution 
is not and requires diligence, discipline 
and good judgement. We aim to double 
the earnings of new investments under 
our ownership through operational 
improvements, international growth and 
careful M&A strategies. This year, 93% 
of our portfolio companies by value grew 
their earnings (2016: 84%).
Action was the strongest performer 
again; it is a very special company and a 
low price, consumer champion. As a fast 
growth, disruptive retailer, Action has been 
transformed by the successful execution 
of its international expansion strategy. 
Store openings increased from 52 in 2012 
to 197 in 2016 and Action now has more 
than 890 stores and annual sales in excess 
of €2.6 billion. The compound annual 
growth rates for sales and EBITDA since 
2012 exceed 30%, like for like growth rates 
are 6%–7% per annum and cash ﬂow is 
strong. This sector-leading performance 
under our ownership has already resulted 
in cash distributions to 3i equivalent to  
4.9x our original investment.
There is still plenty of runway for expansion 
at Action and potential for further rapid 
value growth for 3i. Action has been 
welcomed in each country it has opened 
in and its store opening programme 
now covers six countries and more new 
stores are planned in 2017 over 2016. 
Action is also set to open its fourth 
and ﬁfth distribution centres in 2017 . 
Such material growth requires strong 
operational capability and Action, with 
support from 3i, is focused on managing 
the risks associated with this rapid 
growth by enhancing its teams and other 
resources in logistics, direct sourcing, 
IT and inventory control to meet the 
increasing demands of the business.
But 3i is not just about Action. The  
portfolio we have constructed in recent 
years, our 2013–16 vintage, produced a 
gross investment return of 29% in FY2017 , 
and is already a top quartile performer, 
valued on a multiple of 1.7x (31 March 
2016: 1.5x).
 
FY2017 was another important year 
for 3i. Our Private Equity and Infrastructure 
businesses performed well and we simpliﬁed 
the Group by selling our Debt Management 
platform. Our efforts over the last few years 
in reshaping the portfolio mean we are now 
able to focus on active asset management 
and origination.  Overview Private Equity Infrastructure

The performance of Scandlines has 
accelerated since our further investment 
in 2013. We expect further delays to the 
competing Rødby Puttgarten tunnel 
project, while the business continues to 
generate good levels of cash ﬂow and 
earnings growth. 
A fundamental part of our investment 
strategy is to facilitate the international 
expansion of our portfolio companies. 
Since our investment in 2013, ATESTEO, 
the world’s leading drivetrain testing 
services provider to the automotive 
industry, has increased the utilisation  
of its testing facilities in Germany and 
expanded its Chinese footprint. As a result, 
its Chinese capacity has doubled and 
sales have increased by more than 100%. 
The outlook looks promising, with further 
expansion in China and North America 
in progress.
Aspen Pumps, Audley Travel, Basic-Fit,  
Q Holding and Euro-Diesel also performed 
well, with strong, organic earnings growth. 
However, it is inevitable that there will 
be some challenges in any broad-based 
Private Equity portfolio and our high 
street retailer, Christ, suffered from 
declining footfall.
As mentioned earlier, we have refocused 
our model and have largely exited the 
older and often minority investments that 
we invested in before the strategic review 
in 2012. Many of these assets have required 
a great deal of asset management. Some, 
but not all, have been a signiﬁcant drag on 
the value growth of our portfolio over the 
last few years.
In August 2016, we became aware 
of accounting irregularities at Agent 
Provocateur which had concealed its true 
ﬁnancial position and lack of liquidity. 
We wrote down the investment to nil 
and the business was subsequently sold 
through an administration process, with 
the proceeds being insufﬁcient to return 
any value to 3i, resulting in a total write-
down in the year of £49 million.
In total, our Private Equity realisation 
activity produced approximately 
£1 billion of cash proceeds this 
year (2016: £718 million) at good 
return multiples and we now own 
a leaner, higher-performing portfolio 
of 37 assets and three quoted stakes 
(2016: 47 assets and ﬁve quoted stakes).
Our permanent capital is a distinct 
competitive advantage. It ensures we 
can be ﬂexible and opportunistic and it is 
a fundamental aspect of our differentiated 
strategy. It enables us to hold assets for 
longer periods if we believe that there 
is potential for additional value creation. 
This is particularly important in an 
economic environment where there are 
limited opportunities for attractive new 
investment at sensible prices.
We are well established in continental 
Europe and were the ﬁrst private equity 
ﬁrm to set up a number of ofﬁces across 
Europe. Our brand and local investment 
teams are held in high regard in these 
markets and we enjoy good visibility 
over the deal ﬂow in our chosen sectors. 
As the requirements of managing the 
older assets have diminished, we have 
been able to source and complete more 
new investment opportunities. 
We completed new investments in 
BoConcept, Schlemmer and Ponroy 
Santé together with a further investment 
in Q Holding to support its acquisition of 
Degania in FY2017 . A German investment, 
Lampenwelt, and a Dutch investment, 
Hans Anders, were announced in March 
2017 and April 2017 respectively and 
should complete by the end of June 2017 . 
We also announced an investment in 
Formel D in May 2017 .
A year of exceptional 
investment activity 
in Infrastructure
Our Infrastructure business has 
achieved good growth since 3iN’s 
change of strategy and update to its 
return target, announced in May 2015. 
Although the infrastructure market is 
very competitive, particularly for larger 
economic infrastructure assets, 3iN’s 
revised investment strategy enabled the 
business to compete with conﬁdence for 
assets that ﬁtted its current mid-market 
remit. We advised 3iN on £479 million 
of new investments in total in the year 
and have recruited selectively to ensure 
that we have the strength and depth to 
manage the investment portfolio, as well 
as boost origination.
To support this expansion, we maintained 
our 34% share of 3iN in its June 2016 
capital raise, the proceeds of which have 
since been fully invested. The 3iN shares 
have performed strongly, generating 
a total shareholder return of 16% in the 
year (2016: 13%). Overview

Chief Executive’s  
review
continued
Over the last year, we have been working 
on a number of new fund platforms, one 
in North America and two in Europe, to 
broaden our capabilities and deal ﬂow and 
complement our mandate as investment 
adviser to 3iN.
In Europe, we announced the launch of 
a new £700 million fund, managed by 3i, 
to purchase a portfolio of assets from the 
EISER Global Infrastructure fund. Post year 
end, 3i invested £35 million in this fund, 
alongside two pension fund investors. 
Our Infrastructure business manages two 
funds dedicated to operational PPP and 
renewables projects, one of which was 
coming to the end of its investment life. 
In April 2017 , we seeded a new fund with 
substantially all of its remaining assets. 
3i has committed up to €40 million to 
this fund alongside a group of external 
investors and we expect a ﬁnal close 
later on in the year. We launched our 
North American Infrastructure business 
in March 2017 as a natural and key 
strategic extension of 3i’s established 
European platform. 
Continuing to focus  
on driving performance
Following our successful disposal of Debt 
Management we have a more streamlined 
investment capability, focused on Private 
Equity and Infrastructure, and built on 
our proprietary capital foundation, with 
a growing fund management capability 
in Infrastructure. The broader macro-
economic back-drop has improved over 
the last year and we see generally decent 
GDP growth ahead in our main markets  
of northern Europe and North America.
However, the market for new investment 
remains challenging. High asset valuations, 
together with intense competition from 
corporate buyers and other private 
equity investors, mean that maintaining 
our selective and disciplined approach is 
essential in order to continue to generate 
attractive returns.
Outlook
3i is now performing as it should, with 
careful investment and active asset 
management generating very strong 
returns. The broader environment 
remains volatile and challenging but we 
remain conﬁdent in our ability to deliver 
continued, good growth for shareholders. 
We have strong investment capabilities in 
both our divisions and our well-established 
international network, together with 
our proprietorial approach, give us real 
competitive advantage.
We will avoid complacency and maintain 
our disciplined approach to investment 
and the costs of our platform, as well 
as maintaining our focus on the mid 
market where we see the most attractive 
opportunities. This approach should 
underpin high returns for shareholders, 
together with healthy cash dividends.
I would like to thank the 3i team for their 
hard work and contribution to what has 
been an excellent year for the Group.  
3i is now a much more balanced and 
resilient business, with a clear strategy 
and a well-funded balance sheet.
