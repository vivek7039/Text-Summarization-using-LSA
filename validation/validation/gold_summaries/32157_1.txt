A defining transaction
For more than 15 years our strategy has been based  
on continually investing in the development of financial 
technology for the trading community. During the course 
of last year we took our most significant step to date 
with the founding of NEX. The sale of our voice broking 
business to TP ICAP, which closed on 30 December  
2016, enabled NEX to become a focused financial 
technology business.
Our marketplace is in flux. The ever evolving global 
regulatory environment has caused our traditional 
client base – the sell-side – to change their strategies 
and business models as they seek to adapt. Banks and 
other market participants rely even more on technology 
to support their business and their management of 
regulatory requirements. An increasing focus on 
electronic markets and pre and post trade services has 
created exciting opportunities for NEX and enables the 
expansion of our product and service portfolio. 
Becoming NEX
During the last quarter of the financial year we turned 
our focus to the future with a spirit and perspective 
that confirms the decision to change our Company.
Our culture is one of our great strengths. Only the right 
characteristics can propel a company into the vanguard 
of its industry, and we have a long-standing culture of 
anticipating the needs of the markets and of our clients. 
These are the foundations from which we will invest in 
the long-term growth and success of our business.
Our rebranding from ICAP to NEX was an exercise carried 
out with our customary attention to detail, speed and 
professionalism. During the last weeks of 2016 we 
rebranded our offices around the world with no 
disruption to our business, and we successfully launched 
a new global intranet and multiple external websites 
across the Group. This was accompanied by the largest 
external advertising campaign we have undertaken. I am 
confident that NEX is now firmly anchored in the minds 
of our employees, clients and partners.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Our move towards the consolidated infrastructure 
and interface of NEX Infinity with its unified sales and 
support environment that caters for both sell- and 
buy-side as well as major corporates will provide us 
with enormous opportunities.
As part of this consolidation process we are aligning our 
structure with that of our clients, allowing them a clear, 
NEX business-agnostic view of our full suite of products 
and services. 
 “ The transformation of the Group 
into a focused financial technology 
company and our continued 
investment in new product and 
service offerings will result in  
long-term growth.”
Single legal agreements and a single interface will 
further simplify our clients’ ability to pick and choose 
multiple products either individually or in combination 
based on their requirements and not our own  
corporate structure. 
An example of this is NEX Regulatory Reporting. 
Launched in March, this combines a suite of best-in-
breed services provided by multiple NEX Optimisation 
businesses under a single umbrella to offer our clients 
an extremely powerful and fully resilient cross-asset 
and cross-jurisdictional regulatory reporting solution.
At the beginning of the year we acquired ENSO Financial 
Analytics. We have been and continue to be impressed 
by ENSO, who have demonstrated the ability to build 
a hedge fund client base to which they deliver an 
expanding and well-regarded product set. In October 
we completed our acquisition of Abide Financial. Since 
Abide first came to our attention, we knew it was a 
business which fitted perfectly with our strategy to  
serve our clients’ changing needs. It is one of a very 
small number of companies who offer holistic regulatory 
reporting services, which will become ever more critical 
as financial markets evolve.
During the period we also invested in RSRCHXchange, 
a MiFID II marketplace for institutional research; Axoni, 
a leading provider of distributed ledger technology; 
OpenFin, a unifying operating layer for financial desktops; 
and Cloud9 Technologies, a cloud-based communication 
provider. In addition, we made a further investment  
in OpenGamma, a leading provider of derivatives  
risk analytics.
These acquisitions and investments demonstrate  
how the team within our financial technology 
investment business, NEX Opportunities, 
is successfully building an impressive portfolio  
of emerging financial technology companies. 
In February, Per Sjöberg, CEO of TriOptima, decided 
to leave the business to pursue other ventures. I would 
like to record here my thanks to him for all his 
contributions since he founded the business in 2000. 
Ready for the future
NEX is in a position to change our industry. We have 
a portfolio of services that no one else can offer, and 
which gives us the ability to build our reputation and 
brand as the world’s leading electronic platform for  
OTC transactions and post trade services to all parties. 
We are already expanding beyond our traditional 
sell-side client base of banks and professional trading 
firms to embrace hedge funds, corporates, asset 
managers, sovereign wealth funds and global, regional 
and central banks. NEX will become synonymous with a 
supermarket of services, delivering world-class products 
and first-rate service and support to our clients.
With NEX Markets we have the world’s leading 
electronic trading platform for the fixed income 
markets and a leading electronic FX trading business 
with significant market share in many currencies. We 
continue to develop the next generation of financial 
technology for the trading community which will enable 
us to create the pre-eminent global e-platform for the 
FX and fixed income markets. At the same time, we are 
restructuring the business to be far more client-focused.
This past year we have seen significant growth on 
EBS Direct, our FX relationship-based trading venue, 
with new counterparties trading on the platform, record 
daily volumes and the roll out of FX forwards to new 
client segments. Our enhancements to the EBS central 
limit order book, EBS Market, such as the launch of EBS 
Live Ultra – our premium market data service – are 
benefiting clients and maintaining our market share,  
and we have seen further expansion of our Asian NDF 
business in addition to our eFix matching service.
BrokerTec continues to be the reference point in the 
US Treasury market and we have seen growth in US  
and EU repo. In March, BrokerTec acquired a majority 
share in e-MID – a multilateral trading platform for 
interbank deposits and money market instruments  
in Europe. Integrating the e-MID technology into our 
infrastructure, we can offer its Italian government 
bond repo and interbank deposit businesses to our 
extensive international client base. With access to 
the domestic financial community in Italy, we plan to 
establish a money market offering for Italian corporates 
and are excited about contributing to the further 
development and evolution in this central market.
In NEX Optimisation we already have many solutions 
that help clients simplify and optimise their resources 
across the transaction lifecycle.

The event raised £8.2 million supporting over 200 
charities globally, which is equivalent to more than 5% 
of NEX’s full-year pre-tax trading profit. My thanks to 
all involved for their tremendous spirit and support.
This year’s dividend and outlook for the 
coming year
The directors recommend a final dividend of 27 .0p per 
share which will result in a full-year dividend of 38.5p per 
share (2015/16: 38.5p per share). If approved, the final 
dividend will be paid on 21 July 2017 to shareholders  
on the register at the close of business on 30 June 2017 .  
The shares will be quoted ex-dividend from 29 June 2017 .
Our performance continues to be strong in a tough 
market environment while trading activity since the 
start of the year has been subdued as volatility remains 
low despite sporadic activity around political events. In 
the year ahead NEX will continue to make progress on 
its strategy to deliver against its growth objectives and 
drive operational leverage.
I would like to thank our employees for their energy and 
commitment during this transition year. We have much 
ahead of us as we create a strong identity for NEX. I am 
convinced that together we have the innovation and 
leadership skills to enable us to build a great business.
Michael Spencer
Group Chief Executive Officer
We continue to identify and provide capital to firms 
delivering new platforms, business models and next 
generation technologies with the objective of driving 
significant efficiency, transparency and scale across  
the transaction lifecycle.
NEX Exchange has exactly the same regulatory, legal 
and tax status as the alternative markets, which we 
combine with a high-quality service to help 
entrepreneurs raise capital on the public market.
2016/17
For the year ended 31 March 2017 , the Group reported 
revenue from continuing operations of £543 million,  
up 18% on the prior year. On a constant currency basis, 
revenue from NEX Markets was up 8% and from NEX 
Optimisation was up 9%.
During the course of the year, the Group’s trading 
performance benefited from increases in market share 
across various products including BrokerTec UST Actives 
and Asian NDFs and new product launches such as 
triResolve Margin and new functionality on EBS Treasury. 
This was partly offset by historically low FX volatility 
impacting trading activity on the EBS FX platform.
The Group reported a trading operating profit of  
£145 million, an increase of 4% on the prior year  
(or 12% if we exclude the impact of FX hedging). 
Although the Group’s trading operating profit margin 
reduced to 27% (2015/16: 30%), underlying profitability 
was higher after adjusting for FX hedging.
Charity Day
Our 24th Annual Charity Day was held in December 
2016. This truly global fundraising event has become 
a fixed point in the financial services industry calendar. 
It was a delight to welcome Prince Harry as well as the 
Countess of Wessex and many other celebrity patrons 
of our selected charities to the London office.
