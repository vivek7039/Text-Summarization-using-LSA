 As expected, Emerging Markets 
generated good returns over the past 
year both in absolute terms and relative 
to Developed Markets, and capital flows 
into Emerging Markets have resumed. 
With this favourable backdrop, Ashmore 
continues to deliver strong investment 
performance for clients, and its business 
model has performed as expected with 
good operational and financial performance 
demonstrated by the increase in the Group’s 
revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin and 
diluted EPS. The ongoing improvements in 
economic and political fundamentals across 
Emerging Markets compare favourably 
with the structural growth challenges in the 
developed world, and provide substantial 
opportunities for Ashmore to continue to 
deliver value for clients and shareholders.
Emerging Markets backdrop
Index returns across the main Emerging 
Markets asset classes were strong over 
the year to 30 June 2017 and ranged from 
+6% in external debt to +24% in equities. 
This means that Emerging Markets assets 
continue to outperform their developed 
world counterparts, in both fixed income and 
equity markets. While the rally has not been 
a straight line, the brief interruptions have 
been caused by events in the developed 
world, such as the US election result in 
November 2016. The consequent reset 
in Emerging Markets prices presented 
attractive value opportunities for investors, 
most of whom are underweight the 
asset classes.
Investment performance and AuM 
growth
Ashmore’s investment performance is 
strong, as expected at this point in the 
market cycle, with outperformance relative 
to benchmarks and peers reflecting the 
decisions to add risk when market conditions 
were weaker and Ashmore’s active 
investment processes identified and acted 
upon the significant value available across 
a wide range of asset classes. The market 
recovery is in its early stages, with plenty of 
value still to be captured by active managers. 
The positive outlook, described in more detail 
in the Market review, provides the potential 
for continued outperformance by Ashmore’s 
investment processes that have been 
consistently deployed over the past 25 years. 
As the chart below shows, since its inception 
in 1992, Ashmore’s first fixed income 
fund, EMLIP, has delivered consistent 
outperformance against its benchmark, 
the JP Morgan EMBI GD index, and for 
comparison the S&P 500 equity index.
Ashmore’s assets under management 
increased by 12% over the 12 months 
from US$52.6 billion to US$58.7 billion, 
through positive investment performance 
of US$4.2 billion and net inflows of 
US$1.9 billion. As the cycle turned, gross 
sales momentum picked up and the second 
half of the year delivered consecutive 
quarters of net inflows.
The typical investor is underweight Emerging 
Markets, with an allocation of less than 
10% and in some cases well below 5%, 
compared with representative benchmark 
weights of 20%. This presents a significant 
medium-term growth opportunity, as 
investors should raise allocations towards 
benchmark weights, and those benchmarks 
increasingly reflect the growing relevance 
of Emerging Markets within the world’s 
economy and capital markets.
Financial performance
Reflecting the growth in assets under 
management, the Group’s net revenue 
increased by 11% year-on-year. The 
favourable market environment also provided 
opportunities to generate performance fees, 
although the vast majority (89%) of the 
Group’s fee income continues to be derived 
from recurring net management fees.
The Group’s disciplined control of fixed 
costs limited operating cost growth 
excluding consolidated funds to 7% and 
notwithstanding investment in the rapidly 
expanding local market platforms in countries 
such as Colombia, Indonesia and Saudi 
Arabia. Consequently, the adjusted EBITDA 
margin rose from 62% to 65%. Cash 
generation in the period was strong, with

Strategic and business 
developments
There are several prominent themes that will 
affect the asset management industry over 
the medium term, including the increase 
in passive investing in certain markets, 
continual regulatory developments, and, 
partly in response to some of the perceived 
challenges, the industry has seen some 
consolidation activity. 
In relation to recent regulatory developments 
such as MiFID2, Ashmore has been working 
towards the implementation date of January 
2018 and consequently is well prepared and 
believes the impact on its business model 
will be manageable. 
Ashmore’s strategy and business model 
are designed to deliver value to clients 
and shareholders over the longer term by 
growing a high-quality, diversified, focused, 
specialist active investment management 
business. This should mean that Ashmore 
is well placed to deal with any medium-term 
industry challenges and to take advantage 
of the opportunities that may arise.
Phase 1: Emerging Markets investment 
universe continues to grow
The Emerging Markets investment 
universe continues to grow rapidly and 
now comprises US$44.6 trillion of fixed 
income and equity securities, an increase 
of 12% or US$4.7 trillion over the past 12 
months. While the representation of these 
markets in benchmark indices remains 
inadequate, with just 8% of bonds and 18% 
of equities included in indices, this presents a 
substantial set of investment opportunities 
for active investment managers to address 
outside of those securities meeting the 
rigid index eligibility criteria. Furthermore, 
over time, some countries will remove the 
impediments to index inclusion, for example 
by improving foreign investor access to their 
domestic capital markets.
Looking at Emerging Markets fixed 
income securities, the US$20.1 trillion of 
outstanding bonds is dominated by local 
currency issuance comprising 89% of the 
total. When combined with the US$30.3 
trillion of domestic credit outstanding, 
Emerging Markets account for only 27% 
of global finance. Yet Emerging Markets 
generate nearly 58% of global GDP, which 
therefore offers compelling evidence of a 
significantly better investment proposition 
than Developed Markets fixed income where 
73% of global financing is supported by just 
42% of global GDP.
Institutional investors in the developed 
world have limited exposure to Emerging 
Markets, with target weights for a typical 
pension fund being below 10% for fixed 
income and equities. In some cases, actual 
allocations are significantly below targets. 
It therefore remains the case that as 
emerging nations continue to grow more 
rapidly than developed countries, and their 
capital markets increase their representation 
in global markets and benchmark indices, 
the pressure on investors to address this 
underweight position will increase. This 
situation is amplified by the relative value 
arguments in favour of Emerging Markets, 
with attractive yields and equity valuations 
contrasting with the elevated price levels 
and negative real yields prevailing in many 
Developed Markets.
Phase 2: diversification through  
growth in intermediary AuM
The second phase of the Group’s strategy 
looks to diversify its sources of AuM, and 
therefore revenues, through broadening 
access to its distribution channels and 
its client mix. This includes developing a 
meaningful retail business that sources high 
net worth capital through agents such as 
private banks, broker-dealers, wirehouses, 
wealth advisers and other intermediaries.
Over the past five years, the proportion of 
AuM from intermediated retail clients has 
ranged between 9% and 12%. Strong AuM 
growth from clients in Europe, the US and Asia 
ex Japan has all but replaced the anticipated 
run-off of the Japanese retail money raised in 
2010 and 2011, and the proportion of Group 
AuM from these geographies has nearly 
trebled from 4% to 11%.
Ashmore has delivered growth in retail AuM, 
notwithstanding the challenging market 
conditions for much of the period when 
sentiment, and especially retail investor 
attitudes, was negative towards Emerging 
Markets. While retail capital-raising was 
difficult against this backdrop, the Group 
secured new distribution agreements and 
gained intermediaries’ approval for products 
to put it in a stronger position when the cycle 
turned and investor sentiment improved.
Of particular note are the blended debt, 
short duration and frontier equity products, 
which are selling well through retail channels 
in Europe and the US. Asian private bank 
relationships have also delivered growth 
through fixed duration products.
Phase 3: local markets
A key strategic initiative is to develop a 
network of local Emerging Markets asset 
management platforms to capture domestic 
flows. These businesses also provide access 
to global investors wishing to take specialised 
single-country or regional exposure through 
local managers affiliated with Ashmore’s 
strong brand and control culture. While 
many of the businesses are at an early 
stage of development, the network spans 
seven countries, represents a meaningful 
proportion of Ashmore’s employees 
including investment professionals, and 
contributes approximately 5% of Group AuM.
The local businesses are performing as 
expected, with good growth in AuM, 
revenues and profits. During the financial 
year, action was taken to resolve growth 
challenges in some of the weaker-performing
