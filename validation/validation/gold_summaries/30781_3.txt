 Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 22
Overview
The cyber-security and DDoS market 
growth fundamentals remain very strong, 
fuelled by rampant cyber-crime and a 
growing awareness of the significant threat 
posed by cyber-attacks, including DDoS, as 
well as pending regulations.  
Corero has a market leading SmartWall 
product portfolio which has been further 
enhanced in 2017 with new SmartWall 
100Gbps and virtual appliance software 
products.
Our employees and values
Successful companies have a strong culture 
and deeply rooted shared values.  
In common with most intellectual property 
businesses, at Corero, we know that the 
skills, experiences and passion of our 
employees are genuinely what make our 
products and services work. The Corero 
culture has been shaped by our decade-
long experience in the United States and 
our more recent expansion in Europe. 
Corero’s team in Scotland is especially 
diverse; we have team members from seven 
European nations based in Edinburgh.
With a growing business, the level of team 
diversity and multi-site operations, we have 
recognised the importance of our culture 
and values.  During the year, we invested in 
bringing the whole company to Scotland for 
a meeting that we called “The Gathering”.  
At The Gathering, the team agreed Corero’s 
values and refined the definition of these 
values. Corero’s agreed values are:
• Integrity
• Customer delight
• Innovation
• Open and honest communications
• Empowerment
More recently, Corero invested in an online 
tool, known as Kudos, which is being used to 
acknowledge, reinforce and measure the 
values-supporting behaviours and actions 
taken by team members.
Board changes
The notice of AGM will include a resolution 
to reappoint Jens Montanana and Andrew 
Miller who retire by rotation in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association.
Looking ahead
With its market leading SmartWall product 
and the significant investment made in the 
SmartWall technology, and the strategy of 
expanding Corero’s routes to market 
through channels and go to market partners, 
the business is well placed to deliver on its 
strategic goals and become a leading player 
in the DDoS mitigation market.
I would like to give special thanks to our 
institutional and private investors for their 
continued support of the Company’s 
strategy and funding requirements.
Finally, thank you to all our employees for 
their hard work and commitment.
