Renishaw is a world-leading metrology 
company operating in two key business 
areas, metrology and healthcare.
We manufacture our products in the 
UK, Ireland, India, Germany, USA 
and France.
What we do 
Metrology products:
Our technology solutions help 
manufacturers to maximise production 
output, to significantly reduce the 
time taken to produce and inspect 
components, and to keep their 
machines running reliably. In the fields 
of industrial automation and motion 
systems, our high-quality position 
measurement and calibration systems 
allow machine builders to manufacture 
highly accurate and reliable products.
Healthcare products:
Our technologies are helping within 
applications such as craniomaxillofacial 
surgery, dentistry, neurosurgery, 
chemical analysis and nanotechnology 
research. These include engineering 
solutions for stereotactic neurosurgery, 
analytical tools that identify and 
characterise the chemistry and 
structure of materials, supply of 
implants to hospitals and specialist 
design centres for craniomaxillofacial 
surgery, and products and services 
that allow dental laboratories 
to manufacture high-quality 
dental restorations.
The Group has 77 locations in 35 
countries from where we distribute and 
support products for our global customer 
base, with 95% of sales outside the UK.
