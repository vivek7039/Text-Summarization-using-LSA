Q: Why does Xafinity have Co-Chief 
Executives, and how do you divide 
responsibilities?
Ben: There is a clear distinction between our 
roles. I run the business day-to-day, looking 
after big client accounts and making sure we 
implement our best ideas across the business. 
Paul focuses on new business and investment in 
new technology. We both work on strategic 
M&A, although Paul does more of the earlier 
stages of investigating prospective targets.
Paul: We have known each other for twenty 
years since our first days’ training as actuaries, 
and we’ve worked together for most of those. 
We both spend a fair amount of time with 
clients, and having 2 of us gives us the 
bandwidth to do what we need to on this. In 
our market it is not unusual to have 2 CEOs or 
wider partnership structures.
Q: What was the rationale for the IPO?
Paul: This was the logical next step on our 
journey. We are a thriving independent business 
that flourished under private equity ownership. 
We benefited hugely from the investment we 
received from our private equity owners 
following our separation from Equiniti, but we’re 
about long-term relationships with staff and 
clients, so it made sense to have stakeholders 
and a financial structure that also looks to the 
long term.
Ben: Remaining independent was really 
important to us, our people and our clients. 
Transparency, reputation and profile are really 
important in our industry, and we see being a 
PLC as a real edge, as many of our competitors 
are privately owned. It enables us to continue 
investing in our services while still having an 
attractive dividend, and is also a structure that is 
better suited to being able to incentivise our 
people.
Paul: Being a publicly owned company also 
gives us access to capital to pursue our strategic 
vision of becoming the pre-eminent mid-tier 
firm, whether through acquisitions or other 
forms of investment. 
Q: How did the business perform in 
2017?
Paul: Revenue for the year was £52.04m, a  
1% increase compared with the prior year 
(2016: £51.77m). Adjusted EBITDA grew by  
5% to £17.46m (2016: £16.7m) representing a 
margin of 33.5%. We are pleased with the levels 
of new business generation – our wins and 
forward looking pipeline were transformed 
relative to the beginning of the year. Revenue 
growth was disappointing, however, partly 
suppressed by the impact of a contract with the 
Pensions Protection Fund not being renewed. 
Ben: We achieved a great deal to set ourselves 
up for the future. In addition to some great 
momentum in terms of new business wins, NPT 
saw some strong growth, and of course the IPO 
was a significant milestone. We are rolling out 
our new software system, Radar (read more on 
page 17), and some talented people joined the 
business. Having begun to offer trivial 
commutation to existing clients 2 years ago, in 
the last year we took our proposition to new 
clients. We have seen great success, culminating 
in being awarded an exercise on an £11bn 
scheme that made us the market leader in this 
field.
Q: What have been the principal 
developments in the market?
Ben: Last year saw pensions hitting the 
headlines for all the wrong reasons, with 
problems at the likes of BHS and Tata Steel. 
There were serious risks that the members of 
their pension schemes would see material 
reductions in benefits. This has made pensions a 
high profile issue, and kept it very high on the 
agenda for our clients and sponsoring 
employers. Trustees have a harder job than ever 
before. We think this will drive a need for ever 
more support, and we are right by the sides of 
our clients to provide this.
Paul: In DB, there is a move from the Big 3 
providers to mid-tier firms. By way of example, 
Aon Hewitt’s decision, announced in February, 
to withdraw from providing standalone pension 
administration services to keep only clients 
where they provide wider services is a significant 
step. They have resigned the appointments of 
administration only clients. Competitors 
withdrawing from certain areas of the market 
will allow us to gain market share. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Co–Chief Executive Officers' Q&A continued
“ The IPO is the logical next step in our strategy, 
enhancing our public profile and status with 
existing and potential clients and providing 
access to the capital markets to aid future 
growth if required.”
Q: What sets Xafinity apart from rivals?
Ben: The world of pensions is changing 
massively, and the speed at which you can react 
is really important. Relative to our larger rivals 
whose pension arms are parts of much larger 
businesses, our pure focus on pensions is a key 
source of competitive advantage. Versus our 
mid-tier competitors, the fact that we are a PLC 
means we can get investment into the business 
much more readily and quickly than if we were a 
partnership. That drives our focus on 
technology. 
Paul: Also, a number of our mid-tier 
competitors are looking to diversify, and are 
looking to new markets. We think that the 
pensions market for DB in particular is going to 
continue to grow for many years as we rise to 
the challenge of meeting members’ benefit 
promises in full. Our clients’ expectations will 
grow; they’ll want more technology, they’ll want 
more specialism and for some, their problems 
are bigger than ever. We are unashamedly 
focused on helping clients solve those problems. 
This is a market where, if you take your eye off 
the ball, you’ll lose. Some of our competitors are 
in danger of doing that in the unfounded belief 
that because there are no new DB schemes 
being set up, you’d better find something else to 
do. The reality is that these schemes will be 
around for 50+ years, and clients need more 
help than ever.
Ben: In our business we have high levels of 
client loyalty. Partly this is a characteristic of our 
industry. But while clients are loyal to firms, they 
are also loyal to individuals, so our very high 
levels of staff retention are key; more than half 
of our people have been with the firm for more 
than 5 years. Our culture is really important. 
More than anywhere else I’ve worked, our 
people care massively about their clients. People 
are proud to work here, and our clients stay 
because our people stay. Doing the right thing 
for clients has always been the ethos of our firm.
Q: Looking ahead, where do you see the 
greatest opportunities?
Paul: Winning market share is a huge 
opportunity for us. We’ve been doing a lot of 
work to raise our profile among intermediaries, 
which is starting to generate more and more 
opportunities for us to tender. What we’ve 
demonstrated this year is that when we get 
introductions, with our approach to pitches and 
the technology we can show people, we’re 
successful. We’re very optimistic about new 
business levels. Looking at specific services, the 
fact that we were able to win a trivial 
commutation project on one of the UK's biggest 
pension funds has made other prospects view 
us in a different light. We are also starting to do 
a lot to get our message out in relation to NPT. 
We believe that the UK DC market presents 
opportunities for growth given the growing 
popularity of Master Trusts, and the increasing 
desire to offer pension scheme members access 
to the flexibilities introduced by the Government 
in April 2015 under its Freedom and Choice 
agenda.
Ben: In terms of other market drivers, external 
factors such as Brexit or new regulations tend to 
be favourable to our sector, because they 
typically give our clients more challenges. Our 
issue is to make sure we’re developing the right 
solutions for our clients. Providing we keep 
doing that, we see great opportunities. 
Having said this, a general issue with our market 
is that things move quite slowly. It takes people 
quite a long time to make decisions and do 
things; however we are perfectly placed for the 
long-term.
Ben: The recent highly critical FCA report about 
fiduciary management as a model within 
investment advisory services also plays to our 
strengths. The Big 3 do a lot of fiduciary 
management, and there is a real need for better 
governance in this market. Because we don’t 
provide services in that way, we can offer proper 
independent oversight to advise people on 
which fiduciary manager to pick. The market is 
growing, and we’re part of the solution.
Paul: Beyond DB, our view is that the wider 
pensions industry has not stepped up to the 
challenge of the Freedom and Choice reforms 
introduced in April 2015. People in defined 
contribution schemes no longer have to buy an 
annuity, but the industry has not filled the void. 
NPT is a brilliant solution, but we don’t see at 
the moment that the industry, employers or 
trustees are moving quickly enough to make 
sure that DC scheme members, or indeed DB 
scheme members who transfer out of their 
schemes, are properly protected and finding 
cost effective, well governed, fully flexible 
vehicles. NPT is ahead of its time in that regard, 
but the market has been slow to move. We see 
that changing.
Ben: There is also the Department of Work and 
Pensions’ Green Paper on the future of the 
pensions industry, which supported our view 
that standards need to improve. It particularly 
highlighted that smaller schemes are poorly 
served as running costs are too high; they don’t 
have the purchasing power to get the best 
solutions, and the outcomes they get are 
challenged. We’ve launched DB Sense as a 
fantastic solution for small schemes. We were 
already developing this to meet a market need, 
so we’re launching this at the perfect time given 
the DWP’s Green Paper that draws out the 
challenges faced by small schemes.
Q: How would you summarise the 
Group’s primary objective?
Ben: We strive to become the pre-eminent 
mid-tier firm, the best for staff and the best for 
clients. At a simple level, it’s about providing a 
better service, using technology to bring insight, 
at a lower cost than the Big 3. We have scale to 
do things but remain nimble – it’s a powerful 
combination. Strategic Report

Q: Where does corporate responsibility 
fit within your way of working?
Ben: In our quest for Xafinity to be the best 
place for people to work and the best partner 
for our clients, we engage with colleagues, act 
upon feedback from our employee survey, and 
invest in development to ensure that each 
individual can perform to the best of their 
ability. As we touched upon earlier, our culture 
of doing the right thing for clients permeates 
our business, and begins with us doing the 
right thing for our people. We are an equal 
opportunities employer and do not 
differentiate on the grounds of gender, 
ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion or physical 
ability. 46% of our headcount of 429 
colleagues are female. Behaving ethically is an 
essential part of working at Xafinity, 
fundamental to our reputation and success, 
and the foundation of doing the right thing  
for clients.
Paul: In relation to sustainability, given the 
size of our group and the office-based nature 
of what we do, we believe the direct 
environmental impact of our people and 
operations is relatively low. Having said that, 
we strive to work in a responsible and 
sustainable manner, and encourage our 
people to minimise their environmental 
impact in their day-to-day activities.
Ben: On behalf of both of us I wish to thank our 
people for their contribution and dedication. 
Their genuine commitment to clients is at the 
heart of our business, and critical to our future 
success. With our enhanced team, market 
leading technology and portfolio of services that 
are centered on pensions, we are well placed to 
support existing and prospective clients, and we 
look forward with optimism.
