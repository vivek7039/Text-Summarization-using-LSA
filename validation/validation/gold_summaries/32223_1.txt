We have delivered good results despite 
challenges in our markets following the EU 
referendum. Our markets were stronger  
than many anticipated and our strategy, which 
positions us to benefit from long term trends,  
is delivering. Rising consumer expectations, 
the blurring of work and leisure time and the 
transforming impact of technology are the  
key themes shaping demand for our space. 
Nearly one year after the EU referendum, we  
see clear signs that the impact of these trends 
is accelerating, driving polarisation in our 
markets. Our leasing performance has been 
good, contributing to strong earnings growth; 
we have intensified our focus on where our 
placemaking expertise can enhance value, 
attracting a broader range of occupiers; and we 
have sold well, providing the capital to exploit 
opportunities we have within our portfolio. 
Our strategy is to differentiate our space  
by providing places which reflect people’s 
changing lifestyles. We use our placemaking 
expertise to create great environments both 
inside and outside our buildings – creating 
Places People Prefer. This underpins our  
focus on our multi-let retail properties and  
our London campuses which are increasingly 
mixed use.
Investment markets were weaker in the first 
half, reflecting uncertainty both before and 
after the EU referendum, but improved in  
the second half as the UK economy proved 
resilient. Overall, our EPRA net asset value was 
down just 0.4% to 915 pence per share. Retail and 
Offices valuations were down 1.8% and 0.7% 
respectively, with both sectors experiencing yield 
expansion in the first half but modest contraction 
in the second half. Our disposals provide clear 
evidence to support these valuations.
Our portfolio is virtually full with occupancy  
of 98%. Despite the low level of vacancy, we 
signed 1.7 million sq ft of lettings and renewals 
in the year, on average 8.0% ahead of ERV. In 
both the retail and office markets we are seeing 
an increasing focus on the best space in the 
best locations. 
In Offices, where the result of the EU 
referendum created greater uncertainty, we 
have seen occupiers continuing to commit, but 
often after longer and more thoughtful decision 
making processes. Our leasing performance 
was strong, with space let or terms renewed  
on 279,000 sq ft of space in the year, on average 
1.4% ahead of ERV. This included the remaining 
space at The Leadenhall Building and Marble 
Arch House. At 7 Clarges Street, the office 
space was over 80% let just four months after 
launch. In addition, we have 700,000 sq ft of 
space under offer or in advanced negotiations 
across our development pipeline. This includes 
102,000 sq ft at 4 Kingdom Street where almost 
80% of the office space was under offer within  
a week of completion in April 2017, on terms 
ahead of pre-referendum ERVs, and 1 Triton 
Square where we are under offer on 310,000  
sq ft representing all of the office space on  
the proposed redevelopment. 
Our focus on London remains. We expect London 
to continue as a leading global city reflecting its 
diverse pool of intellectual capital and reputation 
for innovation, as well as its culture, language 
and strong regulatory and legal framework.  
Our activity this year is testament to the quality  
of our space which reflects the needs of today’s 
occupiers. By providing space which reflects  
the evolving way people are working and  
blending their work and leisure time, we help  
our occupiers attract and retain key talent.  
Our newest spaces are more flexible, catering  
to the demands of big and small companies with  
the option of shorter lease term arrangements. 
This year, we will be launching a branded flexible 
workspace offer which enables us to capture 
incremental demand from the increasing 
number of small businesses taking space in 
London as well as meeting a growing need 
amongst our existing occupiers for flexible  
space for specific projects and teams. We have 
already agreed our first flexible workspace 
letting at 2 Finsbury Avenue, extending our 
relationship with an existing occupier at 
Paddington Central for their digital team. 
In Retail, demand remained firm in the year, 
despite wider uncertainty for consumers and 
retailers alike. We let more space on better 
terms to a wider range of occupiers than in the 
previous year. This amounted to 1.3 million sq ft 
of leasing, on average 10.8% ahead of ERV. 
Consumer spending was resilient in the months 
following the EU referendum, but weaker sales 
Chris Grigg
Chief Executive Officer
6 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW data in recent months suggests that consumers 
are becoming more cautious with higher prices 
impacting disposable incomes. Retailers are also 
anticipating a more challenging environment, 
with import cost inflation, higher business rates 
in some areas and the National Living Wage 
putting pressure on margins. 
These dynamics have increased retailers’ focus 
on space which allows them to trade profitably 
across a range of channels. Our Regional and 
Local portfolio supports their strategy. Our 
Regional centres provide a broader offering, 
suited to larger, flagship stores and attracting 
visitors from a wide catchment for a longer 
dwell time. Our Local centres are convenient 
and accessible and so they work well for click 
and collect and more targeted shopping trips, 
as well as providing a range of amenities for 
local communities. Our placemaking activities 
and our community engagement encourage 
new and repeat visits to our sites and this has 
driven continued outperformance in both 
footfall (ahead of benchmark by 240 bps) and 
retailer in-store sales growth (220 bps ahead). 
We have made good progress on our 
development pipeline. As well as completions  
at 4 Kingdom Street and the offices element of 
Clarges, we committed to the redevelopment  
of 100 Liverpool Street at Broadgate and works 
commenced there in December. UBS have now 
vacated 800,000 sq ft of space across the campus 
on completion of their occupancy of 5 Broadgate. 
Located at the gateway to our Broadgate  
campus and adjacent to the new Liverpool Street 
Crossrail station, this development progresses 
our vision to create a world class, mixed use 
destination at Broadgate providing a range of 
space, including significant additional retail  
and restaurants. 
Gross investment activity since the start of  
the year totalled £2.0 billion and included the 
exchange of our 50% interest in The Leadenhall 
Building, which is due to complete later this 
month, reflecting our disciplined approach to 
capital allocation. This project has delivered 
annualised returns of 25% for us and our JV 
partner since our commitment in 2010 and 
demonstrates how our standalone office 
properties provide liquidity, allowing us to 
develop and trade opportunistically. On the 
retail side, we sold £881 million of single-let  
and non-core retail assets, including 
Debenhams, Oxford Street for £400 million  
and £226 million of superstores, reducing the 
weighting of superstores within our portfolio  
to 4%. Our £195 million of acquisitions were 
focused on adjacencies to existing holdings, 
notably the New George Street Estate in 
Plymouth (£64 million) which complements 
Drake Circus and 10-40 The Broadway  
(£49 million), adjacent to Ealing Broadway.
The net impact of our activity was a 7.4% 
increase in Underlying Profits to £390 million. 
Like-for-like income growth of 2.9%, together 
with lower finance costs reflected in a further 
reduction of our weighted average interest rate 
to 3.1%, has more than offset the impact of 
disposals. Diluted underlying EPS was up 
10.9% at 37.8 pence per share. The final 
dividend payment will be 7.3 pence per share, 
bringing the full year dividend to 29.2 pence per 
share, an increase of 3.0% and contributing to  
a total accounting return of 2.7%. The Board  
is proposing a quarterly dividend of 7.52 pence  
per share or 30.08 pence for the coming year,  
a further increase of 3.0%. The impact of recent 
sales and expiries on future profits, our target 
payout ratio, and the uncertain environment 
influenced the Board’s thinking, as well as the 
opportunities that we have within the portfolio 
to grow income over the medium term. 
The impact of our investment activity has been 
to reduce our proportionally consolidated LTV 
to 29.9% at March 2017 from 32.1% in March 
2016. This falls further to 26.9% pro forma  
for the sale of The Leadenhall Building. With 
our completed developments substantially  
let, and good progress on planning and pre-let 
discussions across the pipeline, we are  
well placed to exploit the optionality we have  
to create value and grow income. We have 
identified near term and medium term 
opportunities that enable us to apply our 
development and placemaking expertise  
in progressing the delivery of our strategy. 
Last week, we obtained approval from  
the London Borough of Camden on the 
redevelopment of 1 Triton Square at Regent’s 
Place, where we are under offer on all of the 
office space. We expect to commit to this, as  
well as refurbishments of 135 Bishopsgate and  
1 Finsbury Avenue at Broadgate in the coming 
months with an associated cost of c.£300 million.
Looking further ahead, our medium term pipeline 
covers a range of uses, including office-led 
development in London and retail and mixed use 
development across the country, notably Eden 
Walk in Kingston where we received planning 
permission for our 538,000 sq ft mixed use 
regeneration during the year. We will maintain  
an appropriate level of development risk; for  
our office-led developments commitment is  
likely to be influenced by the progress of pre-let 
discussions. We have a disciplined approach  
to capital allocation and retain flexibility to 
respond to the changing environment.
In addition, we are making progress at Canada 
Water where we are working closely with key 
stakeholders including the London Borough of 
Southwark. We held our fourth public consultation 
in May 2017 and are targeting submission of  
a planning application around the end of this 
financial year. We have held discussions with  
a wide range of potential occupiers and have  
been encouraged by the response. 
British Land received the Queen’s Award for 
Enterprise in 2016, the UK’s highest accolade 
for business success. One year on, we are 
continuing to deliver strong economic, social 
and environmental performance. Our industry-
leading energy and carbon reductions resulted 
in British Land being named European Sector 
Leader in the Global Real Estate Sustainability 
Benchmark for the third year running and in  
the CDP Climate A List, we rank in the top 9%  
of global companies tackling climate change. 
We have launched Bright Lights, our skills  
and employment programme helping a wide 
range of people into work within our industry. 
That includes within British Land. I was also 
particularly pleased to announce that we had 
updated our policy on Shared Parental Pay to 
provide equal enhanced benefits for all parents, 
one example of how we are promoting the 
development of a diverse and inclusive team.
Outlook 
Looking forward, the picture is a mixed one.  
The Brexit process has begun but uncertainty 
will continue for some considerable time. Though 
the UK economy has performed well since the 
vote, we can expect more inflation and increasing 
pressure on disposable incomes. This will impact 
consumer behaviour and retailer profitability. 
London occupiers, particularly financial 
institutions, are making contingency plans but 
there is a wide range of possible outcomes here. 
Our conversations with occupiers tell us that  
a large majority continue to value London and 
believe in its place as a global centre, as we do. 
Although we are seeing businesses taking 
longer to commit and being more thorough in 
assessing options, we see polarisation of both 
occupier and investor demand accelerating with 
an increasing focus on the best quality space. 
Our results show that our space continues to be 
attractive to occupiers and investors alike, with 
strong leasing across the portfolio, profitable 
disposals and material outperformance on  
our Retail operating metrics. This reflects the 
continuing execution of our strategy, providing 
space that responds to changing lifestyles  
and really fulfils customers’ needs. 
In this uncertain environment, we expect to 
benefit from the resilience of our business, the 
quality of our portfolio and the strength of our 
finances. We also look forward with cautious 
optimism as we believe that we can generate 
incremental returns by allocating capital to 
development opportunities we have created, 
whilst keeping risk at an appropriate level and 
flexibility to respond to changes in our markets.

7 British Land  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Brexit is just one factor impacting our 
markets. Technology is at the heart  
of many far-reaching changes we are  
seeing. In London, Brexit is accelerating 
the trends we are already responding  
to: how people work and live, the growth  
in creative and tech industries, and  
the relative decline in demand from  
traditional banks. 
 
We continue to believe in London in the  
long term and are encouraged by the 
demand we are seeing from occupiers  
and investors for our buildings since  
the vote. However, we have planned  
for a period of uncertainty: we have 
moderated our speculative development 
risk and have continued to diversify our 
office occupier base. We have made good 
progress on leasing discussions and this 
puts us in a strong position to commit  
to new developments to generate 
incremental returns, while keeping  
risk at a sensible level.  
 
Sales over the last year, including  
The Leadenhall Building, have reduced  
our leverage further putting us in a  
strong position to take advantage of 
investment opportunities we have  
created within our portfolio.

own and the strength of our finances  
serve us well as we face the potential 
challenges of Brexit.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED   What makes British Land different?
  We have a clear purpose at British Land to 
create Places People Prefer and this drives 
the business. We have a relentless focus  
on customers so we create the places  
they want; not just individual buildings but 
external environments too – it’s something 
I refer to as ‘inside and out’. And, we have 
the scale and capabilities to deliver on  
this long term approach. 
 
This means we invest heavily in data and 
insights to understand what customers 
really want, informing where we allocate our 
capital. This ensures our properties reflect 
the changing way people live their lives and 
provide what businesses need to thrive. 
 
By investing in well located schemes  
we can create great spaces alongside the 
broad range of amenities, experiences and 
services people want as their work and 
home lives becoming increasingly blurred. 
This is why our London campuses and 
multi-let retail centres are becoming  
more diverse and mixed use. 
 
Our operational scale, expertise and  
long term approach mean we have the 
capacity and skills to make the investments 
required and to deliver the benefits.  
It is the combination of all these things 
which makes us different. 
  You talk a lot about customer 
focus – why is this important to 
a property investment company?
  Successful businesses understand and 
deliver what their customers want. For  
us the interesting conversation has been 
defining who our customers are. It’s not 
just the businesses who lease space at  
our retail centres and offices but also  
the people who work in them, the people 
who choose to shop and spend time there 
and the local communities who live in  
and around them. Understanding these 
different stakeholders and the reasons why 
they prefer one location to another is what 
creating Places People Prefer is about. 
 
An outstanding place caters for all and 
often increases the connection between 
them. If your customers prefer your place 
then your business is well positioned for 
success. That’s why we focus on long term 
trends affecting how we work, shop and  
live and invest in our properties to ensure 
they remain relevant to our customers.  
 
This means people not only want to be in 
and around our properties but want to stay 
there longer too. Our new Leisure Quarter 
at Glasgow Fort comprises restaurants, 
green public spaces and children’s pocket 
parks in which to gather, socialise and  
play. More car parking was also added  
in response to shopper feedback. This,  
with other investments, is changing the 
demographic of people shopping at  
the centre and the retailers we attract.  
In turn, footfall has continued to increase 
and this is fuelling rental growth.  
 
We are changing our London campuses too. 
Broadgate, once home to predominantly 
large City financial institutions, is becoming 
a seven-day-a-week location. It is the 
largest pedestrianised commercial space  
in London and is responding to the changing 
needs of office occupiers, benefiting from 
its position in a dynamic part of London  
and the opening of Crossrail. The way we 
are configuring buildings and offering more 
flexible space on more flexible terms mean 
we are already appealing to a wider range  
of occupiers. By adding more restaurants, 
shops and events we are broadening the 
appeal well beyond the employees of the 
businesses based there. 
Understanding these 
different stakeholders  
and the reasons why  
they prefer one location  
to another is what  
creating Places People 
Prefer is about. ”
