MAJOR NEW WIN: COCKPIT YARD
A NEW DESTINATION FOR 
HOLBORN
Our partnership with Camden Council will deliver a new 
mixed-use destination for Holborn. Located on Theobald’s 
Road within the Bloomsbury Conservation Area, the site 
is currently occupied by Holborn library and Cockpit Arts 
– an award winning social enterprise and creative business 
incubator for designer-makers. 
We are now working on plans that will see the site completely 
redeveloped to provide brand new work spaces, a fully 
remodelled library, a local archive facility, and new public 
spaces. The redevelopment will also deliver 105 new homes, 
including new affordable units.
