 Ten Entertainment Group is focused 
on delivering family entertainment in 
a growing sector of the leisure market. 
Our mission is to make families and friends 
happy; to entertain and enthral profitably. 
The way that people and families interact 
has changed rapidly in recent times and 
we are able to bring families and friends 
together to play, and to have fun in a very 
modern way through the Tenpin brand. 
Our growth strategy is designed to support 
and strengthen our business model, and is 
focused on three simple routes: incremental 
organic growth; growth through acquisition; 
and ongoing investment into both our 
estate and into our support platform. 
This is because firstly, many more marginal 
gains exist across our operations; secondly, 
because value has been proven in acquiring 
single units, converting them to “The Tenpin 
Way” and of course accruing scale benefits; 
and lastly, because sustainability of profit 
growth derived from the lifeblood of a steady 
drip feed of capital to maintain modernity 
and relevance to our consumers and attract 
high-quality operating talent. The logic is 
entirely evident.
We have made very good progress with 
this strategy during recent years.
Our self-managed growth strategy 
is clearly defined and is driven by the 
three routes, but we are also determined 
to see our available market grow as 
consumers gain enthusiasm for spending 
time and their income on more experiences 
and less traditional product purchases. 
Ten Entertainment Group operates with a 
simple, profitable, proven business model 
and with a proposition that is entirely 
customer driven, underpinned by a 
strong culture formed and protected 
by our colleagues. 
2017 was a year of significant progress for 
the Group with the successful listing on the 
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
During April 2017, we welcomed our new 
shareholders to benefit from our robust, 
de-leveraged but growing business.
Ten Entertainment Group plc has 
performed well during FY17: good 
like-for-like sales growth again, the 
successful completion of a further three 
acquisitions and refurbishments at six 
of our centres. Following the successful 
pilot of a business transformation project, 
Pins & Strings, we are now extending this 
technology into ten more of our locations in 
2018 and in time, across each of our venues. 
The combination of these achievements 
has resulted in strong EBITDA growth 
of 14% during the year and therefore we 
can confidently propose a payment of a 
maiden full-year dividend. I am pleased 
to report Group adjusted earnings per 
share of 16.2p.
A key aspect of our sustained and 
most recent performance is our highly 
experienced and motivated leadership 
team, together with a very special culture 
which is focused on delivering consistently 
great experiences for our customers. 
One way we can see this is the most crucial 
measure: our impressive, sector-leading 
Net Promoter Score of 66%, up from 49% 
in 2016. We know it is a crucial correlate 
to sales growth, and therefore core 
underlying profit growth.
I believe operating teams across the 
Group, served by the senior leadership 
team and support group, has the right 
skillset to execute the Group’s strategy, 
deliver significant further growth and drive 
strong returns for shareholders. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to personally 
thank all of our teams and colleagues 
across the Group for their commitment 
and dedication to the Group during 2017. 
They are a remarkable group of people 
and we are privileged to enjoy their efforts 
and enjoyment in working for Tenpin.

heart of everything we do
At Ten Entertainment Group, our people are focused on making 
each customer’s visit a memorable one, and our culture supports

To develop and protect our business 
further we apply good corporate governance 
through a strong and independently minded 
Board which has been appointed to assist 
the Group achieve its aspirations and deliver 
its potential. It meets on a regular basis and 
all have already made substantial progress.
Our strong balance sheet is currently 
de-levered specifically to protect against 
any downside risk on future covenants 
and give us scope for assurance and flexibility 
to sensibly use free cash for dividends 
or acquisitions. The balance sheet also 
provides us with good access to capital 
to take advantage of current and future 
potential to deliver long-term value to 
our shareholders.
The Board are recommending a final 
dividend of 7.0p per share, resulting in 
a full-year dividend of 10.0p per share.
The business is in strong shape, with 
much potential remaining and has a simple 
and proven, low risk, but high growth 
strategy that will enable Ten Entertainment 
to continue to prosper further, delight its 
customers more and deliver consistent 
and stronger returns for shareholders. 
I strongly believe our business is well 
positioned in a growing sector of the 
wider leisure market, and can continue 
to provide our customers with great value, 
family-oriented entertainment, differentiated 
to many leisure propositions.
This ought to be a compelling case for 
many shareholders seeking security of 
income returns coupled with longer-term 
prospects of capital upside.
