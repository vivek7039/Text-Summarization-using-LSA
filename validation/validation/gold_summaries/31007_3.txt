Financial results
The strength of our business model and core value 
proposition once again underpins our robust financial results 
in 2017. Underlying operating profit
(1)
 was up 11% to £184.4m 
(2016: £166.2m) and operating profit was up 10% at £178.3m 
(2016: £161.6m) driven by  revenue growth of 11% to 
£243.3m (2016: £220.0m) and a disciplined approach to  
cost control. Underlying basic earnings per share

 and  
basic earnings per share were both up 14% at 163.3p  
(2016: 142.8p) and 156.8p (2016: 137.9p) respectively , even 
greater than the percentage increase in profits and in part as a 
result of 2.2m shares bought back during the year at a cost of 
£90.8m as part of our policy of returning cash to shareholders.
Returns to shareholders and dividend
Our commitment to return excess cash promptly to investors 
continues to be as strong as ever and in 2017 we returned a 
further £140.4m (2016: £131.3m) to shareholders through 
dividends and share buybacks. Operating cash conversion

was again very strong and remains in excess of 100% of 
operating profit.
The Board increased the interim dividend to 22.0p  
(H1 2016: 19.0p) per ordinary share, which was paid on  
3 November 2017. We are confident in our ability to deliver 
I am pleased to present Rightmove plc’s results for the year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Throughout our history we have enabled our property 
industry partners to be more informed, make better and faster 
decisions and realise efficiencies both during robust and 
quieter housing market cycles. Perhaps the most notable 
feature of 2017 was our continued innovation of digital 
solutions for the UK housing market. We have also continued 
to be the only place where consumers can see almost the 
entire UK property market, giving our customers access to an 
unrivalled audience for their brands and exposure for their 
sales and rental properties. 
Rightmove’s higher value Optimiser product package is a 
perfect example of the changing and improved nature of our 
digital product suite. It gives our customers the ability to select 
the tools and advertising that best strengthen their marketing 
plans and achieve their business goals after discussion with 
and insight from Rightmove account managers. 
Notable new products in 2017 include Rightmove Discover , 
which leverages Artificial Intelligence to assist estate agents 
with identifying instruction opportunities which are the raw 
material for our customers’ businesses. Property data  
has always been at the core of our business and we are  
excited about continuing to harness the power of our data  
to drive further efficiency in the property market, predict 
market opportunities and drive success for our customers 
and consumers.  
Rightmove’s culture is to remove complexity and our  
ambition is to make home moving easier and more  
efficient. Our attachment to our homes and the  
emotional experience of moving house over a lifetime  
is not lost on us. That recognition is underscored in our  
recent television advertising campaign that captures not

Chairman rightmove.co.uk 4
Andrew Findlay to the Board in advance of the retirement of 
our current Audit Committee Chairman, Ashley Martin, in  
May 2018. Andrew brings a wealth of financial expertise, 
commercial experience and a strong consumer-centric 
background and will be appointed Chair of the Audit 
Committee in May 2018. Ashley leaves Rightmove after  
nine years of providing sage advice during a period in  
which our business, financial systems and controls have 
evolved significantly. The Board has benefited from his 
valuable contributions and I am personally grateful for  
his wise counsel. 
Following the year end, we announced the appointment of 
Lorna Tilbian as a Non-Executive Director with effect from  
1 February 2018. Lorna has had a distinguished career in the 
media sector and I am delighted to welcome her to the Board. 
Lorna’s addition to the Board is also notable in that from  
May 2018, this will bring our female Board representation to 
50% overall with a 50:50 representation of men and women  
at both executive and non-executive director level.
Looking forward 
The Board and I are grateful for the confidence and support  
of all our customers and for the talent and dedication of our 
employees. We are clear that our goal is to continue to work 
together to position Rightmove as the essential marketplace 
for home hunters and for property advertisers to reach by far 
the widest possible audience.

policy of increasing the total dividend for the year broadly in 
line with earnings per share, the Board recommends a final

Corporate governance
One of the Board’s responsibilities is ensuring that the Group 
applies good governance to facilitate effective management  
of a high growth business. As the Company’s Chairman I am 
pleased to note that the Group is continuing to foster an 
environment of entrepreneurial leadership and innovation in a 
framework of responsible governance and risk management as 
set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 32 to 45.  
Board changes 
In May 2017, after 16 years of leadership, Nick McKittrick 
retired from the Board. Nick had led the Company as Chief 
Executive Officer since April 2013 and together with his 
management team helped deliver an outstanding financial 
performance with revenues growing by over 50% and a strong 
share price rise during that period that reflected our delivery 
of continued improvements in value provided to customers 
and consumers alike.
Nick passed the baton to Peter Brooks-Johnson, our  
Chief Operating Officer and Board director since 2011,  
and I am pleased to say , that as anticipated, the transition  
has been seamless with the strong results in 2017 and 
continued positive outlook being testament to this.
Having completed three full terms, Colin Kemp retired from 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director in May 2017. In June 
2017 as part of our Board succession plans, we welcomed 
It was a proud year of achievement serving 
property professionals and home hunters. 
We are committed to continue that effort 
with the same level of energy, innovation 
and sensitivity to the needs and demands  
of all our stakeholders in 2018.
