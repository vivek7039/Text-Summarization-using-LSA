Philip Crawford
Non-executive Chairman
I am pleased to report on a year 
of substantial growth and investment 
for Lombard Risk Management plc 
(“Lombard Risk”), underpinned by the 
injection of new equity through the 
placing and open offer that we closed 
in June and July of 2016 and which was 
well supported by our shareholders.
Results
The Group achieved revenue growth 
of 44.8%, giving a five-year compound 
annual growth rate of 21.9%. Recurring 
revenues grew by 21.0% to £12.4m 
(2016: £10.2m) and revenues from 
new licences and renewals of expiring 
term licences grew by 113.7% to £11.6m 
(2016: £5.4m). The Group raised £7.9m 
net during the year via a placing and open 
offer to support its plans for increased 
investment in its products and the launch 
of a new technology development centre 
in Birmingham, and as a result of this 
continued investment, the Group has 
recorded a loss before tax of £1.6m 
(2016: £2.2m). Net cash as at the year 
end stood at £7.0m (2016: £3.3m). 
Dividend
The Group suspended its progressive 
dividend policy in the year ended 
31 March 2016 and it remains the view 
of the Board that the Group’s resources 
are best directed towards the exploitation 
of the considerable opportunities that 
continue to present themselves in both 
the regulatory reporting and collateral 
management software markets. The Board 
does not therefore recommend the 
payment of a dividend. 
Strategy
The support of our shareholders in 
both the placing and open offer closed 
during the year has enabled the Group 
to accelerate its strategy on a number 
of fronts. First, we continue to invest in 
the evolution of AgileREPORTER
®
, which 
will provide clients with a global platform 
from which to service their regulatory 
reporting requirements across multiple 
jurisdictions. Second, the launch of our 
cloud-based collateral management 
product, AgileCOLLATERAL
®
, allows 
clients of all sizes to access the

on a module-by-module basis. Third, 
the opening of our new technology 
development centre in Birmingham, 
UK, will introduce new efficiencies to 
the development, testing and support 
of our software products. In addition, 
our alliance partnerships with a number 
of key partners provides us with both 
increased bandwidth and a breadth 
of support in our sales, implementation 
and support activities. 
Employees
The substantial growth experienced by 
the Group could not have been delivered 
without the dedication and diligence 
of the Lombard Risk team across all 
of our locations and I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all of our 
employees on behalf of the Board for 
their continued support. 
Board of Directors
There have been no changes to the 
composition of the Board since the 
Annual General Meeting held in July 2016. 
I would like to extend my thanks to my 
fellow Directors for their contributions 
to the Group over the last year. 
Outlook
The Board is very pleased with the progress 
made in delivering the Group’s two-year 
plan that supported the injection of new 
equity last year. The investment in both our 
product suite and our delivery capability, 
coupled with the strength of our alliance 
partners and the recent investment in our 
regional sales leadership teams, puts the 
Group in an excellent position to continue 
to deliver this plan. As I stated in our trading 
statement of 19 April 2017, the year to 
31 March 2018 promises to be a pivotal 
year for Lombard Risk as we continue 
to liberate our clients from operational 
and regulatory complexity, and the Board 
remains confident in our plans and our 
ability to continue to execute them.
AGM
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 
the offices of Newgate Communications 
Limited at 9.30am on Wednesday 19 July 
2017. My fellow Directors and I look forward 
to meeting shareholders at that time.
