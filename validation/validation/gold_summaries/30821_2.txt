DEMAND FOR UK HIGHER 
EDUCATION REMAINS STRONG
MARKET DRIVERS
Student numbers 
continue to outstrip 
accommodation supply.
With more young people choosing to 
continue their education and investment 
in themselves, there has been a 35-year 
period of growing student numbers 
throughout the country. Today there 
are more than 1.8 million students 
studying in the UK. 
Most UK Universities offer an 
accommodation guarantee for 
first year and international students, 
but even this is a challenge with current 
beds available. UK Higher Education 
institutions have c.300,000 beds 
available, with a further 280,000 
provided by the private sector. 
Demand for student accommodation 
significantly outstrips supply. Many 
Universities have responded to this by 
partnering with private accommodation 
providers, most notably through 
nominations agreements under which 
they make up their accommodation 
shortfall by reserving rooms in return 
for a guaranteed rent. 
Unite’s business is focused on addressing 
the demand for student accommodation. 
In doing so, we aim to provide our University 
partners and students with much-needed 
certainty and a living environment that 
helps some 50,000 students get the best 
out of their time at University.

There has been some speculation that 
changes in national demographics, 
combined with rising tuition fees and the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU, could lead 
to a decline in student numbers and, by 
implication, a reduction in demand for 
accommodation. 
However, data from the Universities and 
Colleges Admission Service (UCAS) shows 
that applications for 2018 from the EU rose 
by 3.4% and those from international 
students rose by 1 1.1%, to a record level. The 
combination of robust EU and international 
demand, growth in post-graduates and 
more 18-year-olds going to University has 
ensured that UK higher education remains 
a thriving, vibrant sector. 
Most significantly, the number of students 
choosing mid- and higher-tariff Universities, 
where Unite’s business is concentrated, 
increased while the numbers at lower-tariff 
institutions fell by 3 per cent in 2017 . As a 
result, in most cities where we operate, 
there remains a substantial shortage of 
student accommodation. 
A number of factors are likely to further 
underpin this demand in the future. Higher 
costs lead to a growing focus on the 
relative value that different Universities 
offer. Driving greater transparency and 
accountability will, for example, be a key 
priority for the newly established Office for 
Students, as under the government’s new 
Teaching Excellence Framework, in June 
2017 Universities in England and Wales 
were ranked for the first time according 
to the quality of their teaching.
These developments are likely to bring 
an even greater level of scrutiny among 
applicants. Against this backdrop, 
Universities increasingly consider their 
accommodation guarantee as a key 
point of competitive differentiation. It 
is a core element of providing support 
and welfare to students as it is where 
they spend more than half their time 
while at University. Some are looking to 
extend it to second and third year and 
all international students. 
In many cases, they are increasingly 
looking at established accommodation 
providers as long-term partners with, 
for example, extended nominations 
agreements or strategic partnerships 
involving their own student housing estate.
In parallel with these developments, 
changes beyond the world of higher 
education are also having an impact on 
student accommodation. The combination 
of an uncertain macro-economic climate, 
low interest rates and dramatic changes in 
the world of retail has brought uncertainty 
to the UK’s wider property sector. In some 
cases, this has created opportunities 
for providers of purpose-built student 
accommodation (PBSA), such as Unite, to 
expand in locations like London where the 
property boom of recent years has made 
investing economically challenging. The 
success of PBSA, meanwhile, has attracted 
significant new investment to the sector 
and, in some cities, increased competition. 
Our continued investment in our portfolio, 
ensuring we have the right properties, in 
the right places, and aligned with high 
quality Universities, means we are well-
placed for growth.
