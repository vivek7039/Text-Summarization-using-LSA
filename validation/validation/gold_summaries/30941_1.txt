 ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14
This excellent and very positive breakthrough 
was boosted after the period end, when further 
collected data showed that the VAL401 treatment 
has also measurable improvement on patient’s 
quality of life. Together, the results advocate the 
potential for VAL401 in treating very late stage 
cancer patients in the palliative arena. This data 
also implies the potential for VAL401, in the as 
yet untested combinations with, both traditional 
chemotherapies and immune-oncology 
treatments. Palliative stage patients could 
expect to see an improvements in symptoms 
with VAL401 treatment, together with improved 
survival prospects. The results seen in this first 
all-comer trial, provides a strong foundation for 
VAL401’s next stage of clinical testing. 
With the lung cancer market projected to be 
valued at USD 7.9 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 
6.6%, the Company continues to be in discussion 
with a number of large pharmaceutical 
companies who are looking to fill their pipelines 
in this important unmet medical therapeutic area.
VAL201
Excellent Safety and tolerability data together 
with early efficacy data leads to enhancement of 
the VAL201 Dose Escalation Clinical Study
During 2017, the VAL201 clinical trial has 
demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability 
profile. In addition, the treatments of patients with 
the compound showed early signs of efficacy 
with relatively low doses. Based on these results 
and in December 2017, ValiRx received MHRA 
approval for the enhancement of its VAL201 dose 
escalation and expansion clinical trial. 
The year ending in December 
2017 has been of profound 
importance to ValiRx. Not only did 
the Company see its two clinical 
compounds make exciting strides 
forward through the year, but it 
also saw those advances culminate 
towards the end of the period 
under review.
The conclusion of VAL401’s Phase II lung cancer 
clinical trial and the production of positive trial 
data showed that the VAL401 treatment has a 
measurable improvement on patient quality 
of Life, in addition to a positive impact on the 
disease and an extension in the overall survival 
of patients. 
The period also saw ValiRx’s VAL201 compound 
showing good safety, tolerability and early 
efficacy in clinical trials. Following the good 
results, VAL201’s Phase I/II prostate cancer clinical 
trial received approval from the UK Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) 
and the Research Ethics Committee (“REC”) for 
the Company to expand and substantial increase 
the dose being administered to patients. This will 
allow treatment to more speedily reach its full 
therapeutic potential and deliver its potential 
anti-cancer impact.
The Company’s preclinical developments of 
VAL301 and VAL101 are going ahead with 
exciting and encouraging results.
During the year, the Company’s patent portfolio 
has been greatly strengthened with patent grants 
for VAL401 and VAL201 in major territories. This 
expanding patent protection further supports 
the Company’s business model and gives the 
Company the basis for meaningful discussions 
with potential future partners.
These advances are of real significance for 
the Group and to patients, as ValiRx and its 
compounds become more attractive to potential 
partners and take a step forward towards 
addressing unmet need.
VAL401
Lung cancer
VAL401 is a re-formulation of existing drug 
Risperidone, into an orally administered gelatin 
capsule, showing in pre-clinical testing, anti-cancer 
properties in several oncological models. The 
period under review has been a defining period 
for VAL401’s clinical development and in Q4 
2017, ValiSeek, the joint venture between ValiRx 
and Tangent Reprofiling Limited, completed the 
Phase II trial and released pharmacokinetic data. 
Following analysis, ValiSeek announced positive 
formal data on the VAL401 compound and of its 
disease impact. The results clearly demonstrated 
that the VAL401 treatment had a statistically 
significant improvement on the overall survival of 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer compared 
to those receiving no treatment.

Governance
Financial Statements
complete the pre-clinical package and arrive at 
the optimal formulation so that the Company 
obtains the necessary regulatory approvals to 
enter VAL301 into a clinical trial in 2018.
GeneICE
Our GeneICE "rebellious gene" editing 
technology has shown continued good progress 
in its late pre-clinical phase. With the programme 
currently benefiting from a second Eurostars 
grant totalling up to €2.6m, this programme has 
been through scientific, medical and commercial 
evaluation. Rebellious genes are the ones that 
are working when/where they should not e.g. 
in cancers, inflammatory conditions, Alzheimer’s 
and autoimmune diseases. ValiRx’s proprietary 
GeneICE technology enables the design of 
compounds for selective binding and silencing 
of these specific genes. The lead GeneICE 
lead compound has been designed against a 
gene expressing Bcl-2 protein, which has been 
implicated and associated with various cancers. 
Pre-clinical work during the period under 
review has been conducted with our partners, 
DKFZ, Heidelberg and Pharmatest in Finland, 
to generate a commercially viable molecular 
structure for VAL101. ValiRx was pleased to report 
commercially viable efficient manufacturing 
capabilities for the compounds and preliminary 
results for the optimised second generation of 
the VAL101molecule are demonstrating gene 
silencing. As such, ValiRx intends to accelerate 
VAL101’s late pre-clinical studies in preparation 
for the compound’s entry into the clinic.
Outlook 
With the extremely encouraging results from our 
portfolio development programmes, I believe we 
are in an excellent position to deliver benefits to 
patients, as well as generate value for stakeholders. 
I very much look forward to the future further 
development of ValiRx and its therapeutic assets.

This approval allows for a substantial increase 
in the amount and frequency of VAL201 being 
administered to patients, thereby allowing 
treatment to more speedily reach its full 
therapeutic potential and potential anti-cancer 
impact. This represents a pivotal and substantial 
breakthrough for the VAL201 prostate cancer 
compound and the Company expects the 
accelerated study to speed-up the human 
development of the treatment, saving both time 
and money. 
Additional Clinical Trial Centres 
To facilitate the enhancement of the VAL201 trial, 
ValiRx will continue working with UCLH and also 
with other oncology clinical sites to participate 
in this latter part of the trial. Results from this 
stage can be taken forward by the Company 
or a partner into subsequent, larger, outcomes-
oriented clinical trials. These will establish 
VAL201’s effects as an anti-cancer agent, on 
overall survival and on the health-related quality 
of life in patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer
VAL201 is a potentially major breakthrough 
therapeutic treatment of Advanced Prostate 
Cancer due to its novel mechanism of action. 
A number of studies have demonstrated that 
Src kinase complete inhibition strongly reduces 
prostate cancer growth but may have side effects. 
VAL201 specifically targets the association of 
androgen receptor with Src,SH3 domain, a signal 
that is important in tumour cell proliferation 
without suppressing other Src-AR induced 
activities. This provides an advantage to current 
therapies, which in addition to abolishing the 
division signalling pathways, potentially also 
inhibit the other Androgen Receptor (AR) 
functions including metabolism.
The readout from the first part of the Phase l/ll 
clinical trial - showed strong safety and tolerability, 
in all trial subjects. Other measurements taken 
were completely consistent and comparable 
to the results seen in the pre-clinical studies. 
Furthermore, the trial has also shown indications 
of efficacy and disease stabilisation on imaging 
and a reduction of PSA progression, in the 
majority of patients. Importantly, the Pre-clinical 
data has also shown tumour growth suppression 
and significant reduction of metastatic growth.
The VAL201 target is also associated with  
other cancers with significant potential to be 
used as a treatment for other hormone-induced 
cancers, such as breast and ovarian, pancreatic 
and others and also for the non-cancerous, but 
very debilitating condition, Endometriosis.
VAL301
Endometriosis
VAL301 is derived from our lead compound, 
VAL201 and is currently in late-stage pre-
clinical development as a non-invasive, 
effective treatment for the non-cancerous, but 
hugely debilitating gynaecological condition, 
Endometriosis. Earlier pre-clinical work on VAL201 
has highlighted the compound’s potential to 
protect women from Endometriosis, with a 
minimal impact on bone density or fertility, which 
are major drawbacks frequently encountered 
with the current commonly used drugs and 
therapies for this condition. Our focus now is to
