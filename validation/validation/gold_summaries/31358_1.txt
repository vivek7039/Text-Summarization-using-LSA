expected to benefit particularly 
from the launch of GatedTalent,

Jason Starr 
Chief Executive
Dillistone Group Plc is a global 
leader in the supply of solutions  
and services to the recruitment 
sector worldwide.
Strategy and objectives
The Group’s strategy is to grow the business 
both organically and through acquisition. 
This strategy is made possible through our 
commitment to product development, which 
ensures that the business continues to 
command a leading role in all of the markets in 
which it operates. 
Our acquisition strategy typically entails 
consideration of businesses offering:
• products that would further increase 
market share in the Group’s core markets; 
• legacy applications, where clients could 
be transferred to our modern suite of 
products; or
• complementary applications, which may 
be cross-sold to clients of the Group.
The Group’s objectives are principally to:
• ensure our products meet the needs of 
the recruitment sector through continual 
investment and development;
• be a leading player in all of the markets 
we serve;
• develop our staff, delivering progressive 
career development;
• increase our profitability and deliver 
increased shareholder value year on year 
in conjunction with a progressive  
dividend policy.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Our business model
The business is split into three Divisions. Dillistone Systems and Voyager Software are our established businesses, with GatedTalent launched in the 
second half of 2017.
Dillistone Systems specialises in the supply of software and services into executive-level recruitment teams. Voyager Software’s clientele are primarily 
involved in contingent recruitment, including permanent placement, contract placement and the provision of temporary staff. GatedTalent is a private 
network of executives, accessed by executive recruiters. This Division generates revenue based on a combination of recruiter subscription and 
transaction fees for connecting with executives. There is a close relationship between GatedTalent and Dillistone Systems.
The majority of our products are commercialised through one or more of the following:
1. An upfront licence fee plus a recurring support fee;
2. Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription basis; or
3. A hybrid model incorporating an upfront payment and recurring support and cloud hosting fees.
There is a continuing move away from the upfront license model towards our cloud delivery services.
The business operates out of four countries: the UK, Germany, the US and Australia. As well as supplying and supporting our software we also host  
the software for a proportion of our clients. This is done through data centres in Europe, the Americas, Singapore and Australia.
In 2000+ ﬁrms across 60 countries, our clients are situated  
across the entire recruitment landscape.
They say that we provide them with:
Stability, ﬂexibility and functionality
Easy access to their data 
Rapid deployment
Ongoing development ensures upgrade path for clients
Our large client base means that we do not depend  
on a small number of clients.
We generate revenue typically through three pricing mechanisms:
Upfront licence fee plus recurring support fee
Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription basis
Hybrid model incorporating upfront payment 
and recurring support and hosting fees

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017 continued
Group review of the business
2017 saw recurring revenues grow 6% to 
£7.474m (2016: £7.027m) reflecting the 
increasing adoption of our SaaS offering.  
Non-recurring revenues decreased to £1.644m 
(2016: £2.370m). As a result, overall revenues 
decreased by 4% to £9.582m (2016: £9.963m) 
with recurring revenues representing 78% 
of Group revenues (2016: 71%). Costs have 
increased in part due to GatedTalent which 
made an operating loss of £0.439m and which 
was in development for all of 2017. We saw our 
first revenue from GatedTalent in Q1 of 2018 
although, as anticipated, revenue in the first 
half will not be significant and the Division will 
be loss making in 2018.  
Adjusted EBITDA
1
 fell to £1.409m (2016: 
£2.433m). Adjusted operating profit fell to 
£0.309m (2016: £1.463m) and pre-tax profits 
before acquisition related items and one-off 
adjustments reduced to £0.303m (2016: 
£1.458m). There was an operating loss for 
the year of £0.514m (2016: profit £0.412m) 
and loss for the year of £0.071m (2016:profit 
£0.526m). Cash at the year end was £1.390m 
(2016: 1.537m).

Adjusted EBITDA is adjusted operating profit with 
depreciation and amortisation added back. See note 3.
Divisional Reviews
Dillistone Systems
The Dillistone Systems division is primarily 
focused on providing technology solutions to 
the executive search market via our range of 
“FileFinder” applications. This client group is 
made up of both executive search firms and 
executive search teams in major organisations.
Dillistone Systems’ head office is in London and 
it has offices in the US, Germany and Australia. 
The Division accounts for 47% (2016: 49%) of 
the Group’s revenue and it saw revenue fall 6% 
to £4.548m (2016: £4.858m). The Division is 
expected to benefit particularly from the launch 
of GatedTalent, which targets the same market 
as FileFinder and is tightly integrated.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (‘EBITDA’) fell to £0.778m (2016: 
£1.434m) as sales fell and costs increased. 
Total amortisation and depreciation charge 
was £0.589m (2016: £1.229m). (In 2016 we 
reviewed our amortisation policy for capitalised 
development costs to bring it more into line with 
industry practice by writing off all such costs 
over five years rather than a range of five to ten 
years and the impact of this on the Dillistone 
division was an increase to the 2016 charge 
by £0.600m). Operating profit for 2017 was 
£0.189m (2016: £0.205m).
Voyager Software
Voyager Software is a provider of technology 
products targeted at the entire recruitment 
landscape, from front office to back office 
and bureaus, and includes both recruitment 
management systems and pre-employment 
skills testing technology.
In 2017, the Voyager Software division 
accounted for 53% (2016: 51%) of Group 
revenues. The Division’s revenues decreased 
by 1% to £5.034m (2016: £5.105m). EBITDA 
increased by 10% to £1.200m (2016: 
£1.093m). Amortisation and depreciation 
increased to £0.511m (2016: £0.461m). 
Divisional operating profit increased 9% to 
£0.689m (2016: £0.632m).
2017 saw some major developments in the 
Division including:
• Development of TempNinja – A new mobile 
companion app allowing candidates to view 
and accept temporary jobs, update their 
availability and chat directly with recruiters 
using Voyager’s popular VDQ! and Infinity 
SaaS solution.
• Additional functionality released in 
Infinity (including Infinity SaaS) including 
enhanced support for the temporary 
recruitment sector & Power BI reporting. 
• A well-received industry wide education 
programme around the forthcoming GDPR 
legislation being recognised as an industry 
leader.
• Enhancements and new content for ISV.
Online including tests around the GDPR.
GatedTalent
GatedTalent was established in 2017 to 
provide a network allowing executives to share 
information with selected executive recruiters 
in a GDPR compliant manner. The GatedTalent 
product was under development throughout 
2017 and therefore did not generate revenue. 
GatedTalent is the most exciting product we 
have developed in recent years. The platform 
is free to executives. Revenue will be generated 
from executive recruiters through subscriptions 
to the platform and through charges for 
”connection requests” made through the 
platform.
The platform is now live, with clients using it; 
compliance messages being sent and profiles 
being created. Subscription revenue is now 
being generated. We expect that GatedTalent 
will manage the process of sending around 
3 million such messages during the course 
of 2018. We believe that the vast majority of 
our clients will not send messages before May 
2018, with a number of firms likely to complete 
the process in June or even July.
The Division is effectively a start-up business 
within the Group and is expected to be loss 
making in 2018, although we do anticipate that 
it will have a direct and positive impact on the 
performance of our Dillistone Systems business 
starting in 2018. During 2017, GatedTalent 
incurred an operating loss of £0.439m and 
development expenditure of £0.391m was 
capitalised.
The Board is confident that all three Divisions 
have strong futures.
Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a number 
of risks that include the effect of changes in 
interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange 
rates and liquidity. The Group does not trade in 
financial instruments. Further details in relation 
to these risks are shown in note 25. 
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk 
through its floating rate overdraft, and through 
its management of retained cash. The Group 
monitors its exposure to interest rate risk when 
borrowing and investing its cash resources. 
Credit risk
The Group has a large customer base in excess 
of 2,000 customers and is not dependent on 
a small number of customers. Accordingly, 
the Group does not believe it is exposed to 
significant credit risk. In addition, it only places 
money with banks with strong credit ratings. 
Exchange risk
The Group is exposed to translation and 
transaction foreign exchange risk. The Group’s 
foreign operations primarily trade in their own 
currencies, reducing the transaction risk.  
As a result, the main foreign exchange 
transactional exposure arises when repatriating 
profits. The Group only seeks to remit cash 
when required in the UK and it usually has 
some flexibility on timing of such appropriations 
to minimise any exchange losses. The Group 
is, however, exposed to translation risks on net 
assets held. 
Liquidity risk
Although the Group has some borrowings, it 
maintains positive cash resources and has 
sufficient available funds for its operations and 
planned expansion of its existing activities.  www.dillistonegroup.com 11
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017 continued
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have an impact on the Group’s long term performance and cause actual results to differ 
materially from expected and historical results. The Directors seek to identify material risks and put in place policies and procedures to mitigate any 
exposure. The table of risks that follows gives details of the principal risks and the approach being taken to manage them.
Risk Potential adverse impact Mitigation
Economic risk The recruitment industry has a reputation for being 
vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the economy. This can 
impact significantly on non-recurring revenue and to a 
lesser extent recurring revenue. 
The Company operates globally and so is not reliant on 
one economy. It enjoys a high percentage of recurring 
revenues. Acquisitions have increased the exposure to the 
UK economy. Future acquisitions may be overseas.
In a downturn there may be a reduction in new permanent 
hires which may be replaced by temporary hires.  
The temporary recruitment market is potentially anti-
cyclical. The Group’s products support both permanent 
and temporary hires.
Innovation and new products help maintain opportunities 
for the business world-wide.
New product risk All technology suppliers need to develop new products and 
applications and there is always a risk that new products 
may lead to issues. This could damage the Group’s 
reputation and result in loss of new orders and therefore 
reduce revenue growth. It could also result in claims 
against the Group.
The cost and time frame for developing and releasing new 
products could be a bigger drain on resource than built into 
budgets and forecasts. 
Products are tested pre-launch, and launch and 
implementation strategies developed to minimise risks. 
The development plan is regularly reviewed by 
management and the Board.
Agile project methodology so stakeholders have regular 
visibility and influence on what is being developed.
Product Manager added in 2018 for Dillistone Systems  
to help ensure product is fit for purpose.
Additional UX (User Experience) Resource to be added  
to help deliver software that meets the needs of clients  
in 2018.
Attrition of customer 
base
Failure to attract new customers, or the loss of existing 
customers, may have a detrimental effect on the Group’s 
ability to generate revenues.
Actively manage existing customer relationships through 
account management structures and promptly dealing  
with issues. 
The Group continues to invest in new products with new 
features being added.
Competitor activity The market for recruitment software is extremely 
fragmented with a large number of small suppliers 
operating in all of the Group’s geographical markets. 
Very few of these suppliers have the necessary financial, 
technical and marketing resources to be able to develop 
their competitive position. However, the competition may 
intensify through consolidation or new entrants to  
the market.
Some competitors offer a broader product range enabling 
them to compete across the whole of the sector.
The businesses can easily lose market share if its products 
are not well regarded either from being “out of date”  
or “buggy”.
Some firms may try to compete on price, particularly if the 
market deteriorates.
The Group has strong customer relationships and uses 
account management to keep in touch with clients.
The Group continues to invest in its product development 
and 2017 saw the continued development of temp 
functionality to Infinity, TempNinja and the continued 
development of ISV Online. The Group continues to 
innovate and provide solutions to client needs.
There is a focus on fixing bugs and issues as they arise to 
ensure the user experience is good.
Pricing strategies are reviewed on a regular basis. 
If successful, GatedTalent will provide a competitive 
advantage to FileFinder. Close integration with FileFinder is 
likely to lead to a sustained competitive advantage for our 
executive search CRM platform.
The Group continues to look into developing new products 
and additional features to more readily compete.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017 continued
Risk Potential adverse impact Mitigation
Business continuity 
risks associated with 
information systems, 
operational failure, 
data security and 
cyber security risks
A failure of systems or failure of hosting facilities leading 
to loss of customer confidence in the Group being able to 
deliver their requirements.
Loss or corruption of data held on behalf of customers 
which could have a detrimental effect on their confidence 
in data security processes and could cause financial loss.
External attacks on servers could result in lost or corrupted 
data and loss of reputation. 
Each division is reliant on data centres. Work ongoing to 
move data centres to the cloud through Amazon and Azure. 
Plans are regularly reviewed on how to improve data centre 
management as the business grows worldwide. 
Data backups occur at least daily and the necessary 
test carried out on a regular basis to ensure data can be 
restored. 
Penetration testing helps minimise the risk of attacks. 
Regular review of Group wide infrastructure to improve cyber 
defences locally and at data centres.
Employee engagement 
and retention
Capability to meet the demands of the markets in which 
the Group operates and competes effectively with other IT 
suppliers is largely dependent on the skills, experience and 
performance of staff.
Failure to attract or retain high calibre employees could 
seriously impede future growth and present performance. 
Reliability on small group of people, especially in parts of  
the business.
To retain staff the Group operates competitive remuneration 
packages.
Appraisals are carried out which also consider individual’s 
personal development.
Cross training being carried out where possible.
Ability to finance 
acquisitions and new 
development
The Group wants to grow either by acquisition or through 
development of its own products. This requires that it will 
have the ability to fund such expansion either via borrowing 
or placement, or through the availability of its own cash 
resources.
Ongoing discussions with investors and potential investors to 
build a following in Dillistone.
Management capacity Size of business means that management tends to be 
stretched and under resourced. As the business grows there 
may be insufficient support to ensure that the growth is 
effectively managed and integrated.
In 2018 we anticipate a further strengthening of product 
development management capability and review of 
divisional structures.
Foreign exchange 
volatility
The Group has substantial operations in both the UK and 
overseas. Profits are exposed to variations in exchange 
rates thereby impacting on reported profits.
There is usually some element of natural hedge in the 
currencies, although if sterling strengthens against all 
currencies it can have a negative impact on results.
Brexit Potential economic uncertainty could lead to a reduction in 
orders in the short to medium term, impacting adversely on 
the Group’s results.
Clearly, any changes brought about by Brexit are likely to 
be implemented in the lead up to the exit date, which might 
introduce changes to the UK-EU trading arrangements.
This may impact where recruiting individuals with European 
languages requirement. It may increase the time and 
difficulty in recruiting skilled employees.
Clients usually choose best in class and already buy from 
global firms. The Group continues to monitor implications 
and is continually reviewing its products and pricing to 
ensure it stays competitive.
We deal with visa requirements for some staff already.
Data protection 
legislation
Ensure that all Group products comply with international 
data protection legislation and demonstrate to clients that 
they do.
Work being carried out to ensure data is secure and 
protected at appropriate levels.
Senior member of executive team has GDPR practitioner 
certificate. Appropriate internal committee established.
Numerous webinars held for clients and prospects on the 
impact of GDPR.
Ability to source new 
talent
The Group is reliant on specialist skills, especially in 
Development and Dev Ops and it may not be possible to 
recruit resources locally.
Look more broadly at where staff are based or use of 
outsourcing.
