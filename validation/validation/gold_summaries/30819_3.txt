Divisional Review – Personal Injury
During 2017 we made strong progress in preparing for 
the regulatory changes previously announced by the 
Ministry of Justice. It is anticipated that these changes 
will take place no earlier than Q2 2019.
 
Our preparation for these changes included a 
brand relaunch for National Accident Helpline and 
the establishment and operational launch of two 
ABS ventures. These ventures involve investment 
in certain types of PI cases, with a consequential 
deferral of cash flow, revenue and profit 
recognition. We continued to invest in cases with 
our strategic PLF partners. 
 
Metrics from our brand relaunch in June 2017 have 
been building and we are pleased with progress, 
operating under the theme ‘When it’s wrong, make 
it right’.
 
Investment in cases with PLFs and through our 
ABS ventures changes our medium-term profit  
and cash profiles as we build the number of cases 
in progress, and is the primary reason behind the 
reduction in Group profits in the current year. PI 
operating profits are down from £14.1m in 2016 to 
£11.0m in 2017, with the related deferral of profits 
intended to support future earnings’ stability  
and predictability. Early indications from our ABS 
ventures have been positive, moreover, we are 
already identifying ways to improve their returns, 
supporting our strategy of investing in ABS 
structures.
Our preparations for regulatory changes continue 
in 2018, particularly in relation to the 
consequences of the expected significant change 
in the small claims limit, and the potential 
compensation available for low value whiplash 
injuries in road traffic accidents (RTA). We 
anticipate a broadly unchanged landscape in terms 
of the number of accidents, and the number of 
consumers seeking redress, but expect to 
experience a progressive reduction in PLF appetite 
for these smaller value cases.
Our strategy is twofold – namely to continue to 
work with our PLF partners and ABS ventures on PI 
cases, whilst establishing processes in-house to 
support consumers who might be unable to access 
justice through more traditional channels. Whilst 
our PLF partners may be less inclined to work with 
smaller value cases, handled correctly, we believe that 
I am pleased to report the Group’s results for the 
year ended 31 December 2017.
Summary of Financial Performance
2017 has been a year of considerable change for 
the Group, primarily in our Personal Injury (PI) 
division. We performed as expected, with 2017 
revenue ahead at £51.9m (2016: £50.6m), primarily 
due to a 5.5% increase in PI revenues. Underlying 
operating profit declined as expected to £14.5m 
(2016: £18.0m), reflecting marginal growth in our 
non-PI businesses and significant structural 
changes in our PI division, as we invested in cases 
through our newly launched ABSs. Total operating 
profit was £12.6m, down from £16.2m in 2016, after 
charges for share-based payments, amortisation 
of intangible assets acquired on business 
combinations and exceptional items, with profit 
before tax of £12.4m (2016: £15.8m). Earnings per 
share declined 19.6% to 21.7p (2016: 27.0p). 
“We are enthused by the potential for 
change in PI. We have a market leading 
brand, and the leadership team to 
evolve and develop the division to 
create strong, predictable and 
sustainable earnings and cash flow.” 17 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

they still offer NAH a valuable opportunity to leverage 
its twin attibutes of process efficiency and empathic 
customer focus. With this in mind, during 2018 we 
intend to establish a third ABS, incurring set up costs in 
2018 and 2019. This ABS will be small claims ready, 
and will, in due course, provide digitally enabled 
consumer advice and support. Set up costs, including 
capital expenditure, are expected to amount to 
approximately £4.0m during the next 2 years and will 
comprise investment in people, technology and 
process capability.
 
Divisional Review – Critical Care
The Group’s Critical Care (CC) division has 
performed ahead of last year, but experienced 
slightly softer trading in Q4 compared with our 
expectations. Revenue was up 6.6% to £11.0m 
(2016: £10.4m), delivering operating profits up 
2.5% at £3.9m (2016: £3.8m). 
The division has recently secured a number of 
strategic business development opportunities that 
we expect to contribute to growth in H2 2018. 
Divisional Review – Residential Property
The Group’s Residential Property (RP) division has 
performed solidly in difficult market conditions. 
Revenue was down 7.5% to £8.3m (2016: £9.0m), 
with operating profits unchanged at £1.4m. 
Weakening consumer demand and taxation 
changes have impacted residential conveyancing 
volumes across the market. Management has 
responded to difficult market conditions by 
focusing on operational efficiency to good effect.
 
We expect trading conditions to continue to be 
difficult reflecting the macro-economic dynamics 
facing homeowners and consumers generally. 
Balance Sheet and Final Dividend
As previously indicated, cash generation across the 
Group has been lower than in prior years, with a 54.8% 
(2016: 79.7%) cash conversion of underlying operating 
profit from continuing operations into net cash flows 
from operating activities before interest and tax. 
This decline reflects the planned investment in PI 
cases, with a corresponding increase in trade 
receivables and payables on the balance sheet. We 
expect this lower level of cash conversion to continue in 
2018 as we build a sustainable business model for the 
new PI regulatory environment.
 
At the year -end we had adjusted net debt of £12.7m 
(2016: £8.2m), which includes £0.7m of other payables 
relating to the legacy pre-LASPO A TE product. During 
the year we refinanced and significantly increased our 
banking facilities with a £25.0m rolling credit facility 
(RCF) maturing in December 2021, which will support 
our investment in our PI business.
 
The Board proposes, subject to approval of 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 23 May 2018, a final dividend of 10.6p per share 
payable on 31 May 2018 to ordinary shareholders 
registered on 27 April 2018, making a total of 15.9p per 
share payable for the year . 
Dividend Policy
In 2017 , we have invested over £6.5m in PI cases 
through our ABS ventures and with our PLF partners. 
With positive early indications from both ABS 
structures, as well as the identification of ways of 
enhancing their future returns, we expect to accelerate 
this investment in  2018. Whilst our internal projections 
show significant banking facility headroom available 
we wish to maintain this to preserve maximum 
operational flexibility and to allow us to take advantage 
of opportunities which may arise in due course. 
Accordingly, the Board intends to fund further ABS 
investments, partly by amending its dividend 
policy.  With effect from the 2018 interim dividend, 
dividend cover will be increased from 1.5x to 2.0x 
EPS though the total dividend will continue to be 
paid as to one third at the interim stage with the 
balance to be paid following the full year results.  
We will review our dividend policy again in 2020 
having regard to our rate of cash generation and to 
our debt levels both in absolute terms and as 
compared to our operating profits.
Outlook
T rading during the early part of 2018 has been in line 
with expectations.
The evolution of our PI division is on track and we 
plan to counter the financial challenges caused  
by changing regulation. Whilst this necessitates 
investment in both PI cases and operational 
structures and processes, we expect to see some 
payback in 2019, accelerating thereafter. We 
continue to expect 2018 to be a year of transition 
and earnings contraction, however, we are enthused 
by the potential for change in PI. We have a market 
leading brand and the leadership team to evolve and 
develop the division to create strong, predictable and 
sustainable earnings and cash flow.
We anticipate further growth from CC, supported by 
recent commercial successes. The residential 
property marketplace is likely to remain challenging in 
the short term and our focus will be on operational 
efficiency whilst we engineer market share gains.
2017 has been a challenging year, as 2018 will be. 
Our businesses have responded to those 
challenges strongly, and I would like to thank both 
our business partners and our employees for their 
continued support.
