THE UK’S LARGEST  
INDEPENDENT VEHICLE RETAILER
Motorpoint sells nearly-new vehicles, most of which are up to two years old 
and have covered less than 15,000 miles. We sell vehicles from all of the 
biggest brands, with our best sellers including models from Ford, Vauxhall, 
Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
We operate from 12 retail sites across Great Britain (11 at 31 March 2017), 
supported by a central contact centre which deals with digital and 
telephone enquiries.
Our Auction4Cars.com, a business to business digital auction  
platform, allows an efficient and quick route for sale of  
part-exchange vehicles which do not fall into our  
nearly-new retail criteria.
