Business review
Our business
CMC Markets is a leading global provider of online and mobile 
trading, servicing both retail and institutional clients. The 
company enables clients to trade over 10,000 financial 
instruments including indices, commodities, FX and equities 
through its multi award-winning Next Generation trading 
platform, supported by sophisticated charting, competitive 
pricing and automated execution.
Clients can trade the markets via contracts for difference 
(CFDs), financial spread bets (UK and Ireland only) and binaries. 
The Group also offers a stockbroking service in Australia.
Revenues are generated through a combination of transactional 
spreads, financing income, commissions and trading income 
arising from clients’ trading activities. Our risk management 
strategy is based on highly-automated flow management, 
dynamically hedging net client exposures and risk. The level of 
revenue is predominantly influenced by the number of clients 
actively trading and the value of those trades.
