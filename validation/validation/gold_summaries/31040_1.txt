 “ Polypipe’s balanced business model, underpinned 
by the long-term growth drivers of legacy material 
substitution and continuing legislative tailwinds, has 
helped produce another record performance in 2017.”
CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S REVIEW
In my first review since appointment as 
Chief Executive Officer, I am pleased to 
report that Polypipe has delivered another 
record performance in 2017, with revenue 
from continuing operations 6.3% higher 
than the prior year at £411.7m (2016 
restated: £387.2m) and underlying 
operating profit 6.0% higher at £72.6m 
(2016 restated: £68.5m). Against a 
background of mixed conditions in the 
UK construction market, this performance 
shows the robust nature of the Polypipe 
business model and the strength of its 
long-term strategic drivers of legacy 
material substitution and continuing 
legislative tailwinds in water management 
and carbon efficiency. Polypipe continues 
to be cash generative and has reduced 
leverage to 1.6 times EBITDA (2016: 1.9 
times) leaving the Group well invested and 
able to pursue bolt-on acquisitions that 
complement the Group’s current activities. 
The Group will continue to focus on its 
key strategic and operational priorities, 
and I am confident that we will maintain 
revenue growth ahead of the overall UK 
construction market.
In January 2018, the Group announced 
that it was in advanced negotiations to 
dispose of its French subsidiary (Polypipe 
France) to Ryb S.A., a private French 
business that operates in similar French 
markets to Polypipe France, for €16.5m 
on a cash-free, debt-free, normalised 
working capital basis. In 2017, Polypipe 
France generated revenue of £58.4m 
and underlying operating profit of 
£1.4m. There is very little strategic 
overlap between our UK and French 
businesses as they operate in different 
product areas, the latter operating in 
the significantly lower margin electrical 
conduit, potable water, gas and irrigation 
pipe product groups. Following a full 
review of the business, the Board decided 
Polypipe France was not core to the 
Group and to dispose of it. Completion 
of the transaction is expected in the first 
half of 2018. I believe this deal represents 
excellent shareholder value and once 
completed will allow the Group to 
concentrate on its higher margin product 
areas. For the purposes of this report, 
the results of Polypipe France have been 
treated as discontinued. 
I am pleased to say that the Group 
has risen to several commercial and 
operational challenges during the year. 
Following the EU Referendum in June 
2016 and the subsequent devaluation 
of Sterling, materials costs rose 
substantially in the second half of 2016 
and into 2017. While we do all we can 
to ameliorate price increases through 
cost reduction, selling price increases 
were inevitable. These were successfully 
implemented across the Group in the first 
half of 2017 to mitigate materials and 
other inflationary increases, taking effect 
progressively throughout the period. 
Although exchange rates were relatively 
stable throughout 2017, increasing oil 
prices as well as tight polymer markets 
in the second half of the year pushed 
materials prices higher still, and impacted 
on second half performance. Further 
selling price increases are being actioned 
in early 2018 to address this and other 
inflationary effects. The Group has a 
good history of cost inflation recovery, 
even in difficult market conditions, and 
I have confidence the Group will be 
successful with this latest challenge.

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
22 In June 2017, a trade embargo was 
introduced between Qatar and many of 
the Gulf states following ongoing political 
disagreements. With approximately 
60% of our pipeline projects emanating 
from Qatar, and the more general 
project financing issues in the wider 
Gulf in the first half of the year, the 
decision was taken to temporarily cease 
manufacturing in our Dubai facility, and 
a non-underlying charge of £0.9m was 
recorded in our interim results covering 
redundancy costs and stock provisions. 
During the second half of the year there 
has been no change to the situation 
between Qatar and the other Gulf states; 
the trade embargo remains in force, and 
general project financing still appears 
to be slow as the region adjusts to a 
lower oil price. While the Middle East still 
represents a significant opportunity for 
the Group, we have decided to pursue an 
alternative manufacturing strategy in the 
region through use of sub-contractors 
and to close permanently our Dubai 
manufacturing facility. All equipment will 
be relocated back to our Horncastle plant 
where Polystorm is manufactured for the 
UK market, enabling us to remove the 
need for more expensive sub-contract 
manufacturing in the UK. A further non-
underlying charge of £3.1m has been 
recorded covering machinery relocation 
costs, further redundancy, onerous lease 
costs and asset impairments, leaving the 
total non-underlying charge for the year 
at £4.0m, of which £1.7m is non-cash. 
As well as expanding capacity where 
necessary, we continue to invest in both 
new product technology and automation 
in our businesses. Our new £2.2m 
multi-layer extrusion lines in our main 
Doncaster plant became operational in 
the early part of 2017 which has allowed 
us to significantly increase the amount of 
recycled material used in manufacturing 
our drainage and latterly our soil and 
waste pipes. Towards the end of the 
year, our new £5.0m large diameter 
continuous corrugator came into 
operation at our Horncastle plant. This 
increases our capacity to manufacture 
750mm and 900mm drainage pipes 
and allows the Group to make further 
inroads in this area of the market. These 
new pipes, as well as much of our 
existing civils drainage pipe offer, are 
manufactured from recycled milk bottles 
and other polyethylene consumer liquid 
bottles using our wash plant recycling 
facility at Horncastle. We consume 
approximately 44,000 tonnes of recycled 
material representing one-third of the 
overall material requirement across the 
Group, and both of these projects further 
enhance our already strong sustainability 
and recycling credentials, something that 
is important to Polypipe, our customers 
and our wider stakeholders.
As well as new product technology, 
there has been further investment 
in automation in the year to expand 
capacity, but also to test out new 
automation techniques. We took 
delivery of our first collaborative robot in 
December, which when fully integrated 
into our manufacturing process will 
further improve productivity and quality. 
This advanced, lower cost automation 
technology has the potential to unlock 
productivity opportunities that have not 
been achievable previously because of 
technical or financial constraints.
The treatment of Polypipe France in this 
report has caused the Group to review its 
segmental analysis. The remaining part 
of the previously reported Commercial 
and Infrastructure – Mainland Europe 
segment, being our Italian business 
Effast, will be consolidated with the 
existing Commercial and Infrastructure – 
UK segment to create one segment called 
Commercial and Infrastructure Systems.

STRATEGIC REPORT RESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS
Revenue in our Residential Systems 
segment, which is almost exclusively 
derived from the UK market, was 10.3% 
higher than the prior year at £223.5m 
(2016: £202.7m), of which 6.6% is 
volume growth, considerably ahead of 
the market.
Strong demand in the new housebuild 
sector continued to drive growth in 
the year as the Government’s Help-
to-Buy scheme continues to support 
first time buyers’ demand. The Repair, 
Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) 
market however continues to be slow, 
with weak consumer confidence and 
falling real wages constraining private 
RMI, and austerity in Government 
spending on social housing stock 
constraining public RMI.
Continued growth in this segment, 
exacerbated by merchant pull forward of 
orders ahead of the February 2017 selling 
price increase, led to some challenges 
in the earlier part of the year, notably in 
capacity planning and logistics. The year 
started with below normal levels of stock 
following some pull forward of orders 
into December 2016, but as a number 
of areas moved into seven day working 
these stock levels normalised. Capital 
expenditure on new capacity allowed 
us to revert back to more normal shift 
patterns in those areas during the year, 
and leaves the business well placed to 
continue to benefit from the buoyant UK 
residential market. 
Residential Systems delivered an 
underlying operating profit 13.3% higher 
than the prior year of £44.3m (2016: 
£39.1m) representing a 19.8% margin 
(2016: 19.3%).
CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S REVIEW
COMMERCIAL AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
Revenue in our Commercial and 
Infrastructure Systems segment was 
2.0% higher than the prior year at 
£188.2m (2016 restated: £184.5m). 
UK revenue, which accounts for 79% 
of the overall segment revenue, was 
4.1% higher than the prior year, against 
strong comparatives in 2016. In the 
infrastructure sector, our Civils business 
has seen strong demand for stormwater 
collection, storage and attenuation 
products from the new housebuild 
sector. However, strong demand in 2016 
from the Aberdeen Bypass road project, 
which finished in early 2017, and delays 
in the A14 road upgrade and other 
projects has meant the roads sector 
has been more challenging. The dip in 
commercial project awards seen around 
the time of the EU Referendum in the 
middle of 2016, together with a 12 to 18 
month lag before delivery to site for our 
products, led to subdued demand in the 
commercial sector. Although the project 
pipeline improved towards the back end 
of the year, it is clear that projects are 
being delayed as the continuing political 
and economic situation in the UK causes 
uncertainty. 
Export revenue, which accounts for 
approximately 21% of overall segment 
revenue, was 5.4% lower than the prior 
year, with the performance in the Middle 
East driving this. The large Jebel Ali Hills 
project in 2016 that was supplied initially 
from our Horncastle plant, and later in 
the year from our Dubai manufacturing 
facility, completed in early 2017. A 
combination of project customer funding 
issues, and latterly the Qatar trade 
embargo, meant new projects did not 
come through at a pace to compensate. 
More encouragingly, exports to Europe 
performed well, and in particular our 
Italian business, Effast, made good 
progress.

The Group gains significant resilience by having a balanced exposure to the different 
elements of the UK construction market, all of which have different drivers and move at 
different paces, and this year’s performance perhaps more than most demonstrates this.

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Polypipe Group plc
24 Commercial and Infrastructure Systems 
delivered an underlying operating profit 
of £28.3m (2016 restated: £29.4m) 
and represents a 15.0% margin 
(2016 restated: 15.9%). The financial 
performance of our Dubai manufacturing 
facility, including the temporary cessation 
of manufacturing in the second half 
of the year, is the main driver behind 
this reduction in operating profit and, 
as described earlier, decisive actions 
have been taken to improve future 
performance in the Middle East.
OUTLOOK
Following the Group’s record 
performance in 2017, the current year 
has started ahead of the same period 
last year. Forecasts for 2018 show a 
broadly flat construction market although 
the Group has a strong track record 
of outperforming the market. While 
the UK RMI market is likely to remain 
tough throughout the coming year, the 
strength of the UK new housebuild sector 
will continue to drive demand for our 
Residential Systems segment, for which 
the year has started well. Conditions in 
the UK commercial and infrastructure 
sectors remain positive in terms of project 
pipeline, and demand from key road 
projects such as the A14 road upgrade 
should gather pace this year, but there is 
evidence that project starts continue to 
be delayed, impacting performance in our 
Commercial and Infrastructure Systems 
segment in the early part of the year. The 
news of Carillion’s demise in January may 
potentially lead to further project delays 
as main contracts are renegotiated and 
the impact on sub-contractors works 
through the market. 
Having successfully delivered the 
necessary actions in 2017 to mitigate 
polymer and other cost inflation 
arising from the post EU Referendum 
weakening of Sterling, we again need 
to pass through polymer and other cost 
inflation seen during 2017 and into early 
2018. While doing everything we can 
to alleviate the need for selling price 
increases, we are confident that our 
customers expect us to pass on essential 
increases, and we expect to see the 
benefit of these price increases coming 
through as we move into the second 
quarter of 2018. 
Our continued focus on delivering 
innovative new products and excellent 
customer service, together with the 
strength of our growth drivers of 
legacy material substitution, continuing 
legislative tailwinds and our balanced 
exposure to the different sectors of 
the construction industry, gives the 
Board confidence that despite a mixed 
market outlook, 2018 will be another 
year of progress for the Group and 
our expectations for the year remain 
unchanged.
