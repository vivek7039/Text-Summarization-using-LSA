STRATEGIC REPORT
Chairman’s letter
and we invested in increased resilience which will deliver 
long-term benefits to easyJet and its customers. We also 
continue to ensure that we have a strong and flexible balance 
sheet to underpin our plans for the future.
RESULTS
As a result of this strategy we have been able to deliver a 
robust performance this year. Our passenger growth was 
healthy, increasing by 9.7% to 80.2 million, and revenue 
increased to £5,047 million, an increase of 8.1%. Headline profit 
before tax was £408 million, despite the impact of £101 million 
from adverse foreign exchange rates. Reported profit after  
tax was £305 million.
We have achieved a headline return on capital employed  
of 11.9% as we start to take deliveries of our new fleet order, 
including our first A320neo aircraft.
We are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable returns  
to shareholders and in our dividend policy. As a result we are 
recommending a dividend of 40.9 pence per share based on 
our payout policy of 50% of headline profit after tax.
BOARD
In July Carolyn McCall resigned to become CEO of ITV plc. 
After joining in 2010, Carolyn built and led the management 
team that transformed easyJet’s performance in every  
respect. She put easyJet’s passengers and people at the  
heart of the business, having first built a solid operational 
performance. This has seen both the number and loyalty of 
easyJet’s passengers grow as a result and has led to sustained 
and continuing financial success, which has been shared with 
shareholders with a more than trebling of easyJet’s share price 
and the payment of £1.2 billion in dividends. On 10 November 
2017 the Board announced the appointment of Johan 
Lundgren as its new Chief Executive. Johan was previously 
Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer of TUI Group. He will  
be joining the Company on 1 December 2017, with Carolyn 
stepping down on 30 November.
This year we welcomed Moya Greene to the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. Moya brings significant transport and 
logistics expertise as well as her experience as a FTSE 100 
Chief Executive. At the same time François Rubichon decided 
to step down after three years on the Board. Keith Hamill also 
indicated that he would retire, but kindly agreed to remain  
on the Board whilst we found a successor to Carolyn McCall. 
François and Keith leave easyJet with our gratitude and  
best wishes.
PEOPLE
Once again I would like to thank all of our people, in particular 
those on the front line as they represent easyJet at its best in 
sometimes challenging situations. We continue to invest in our 
pilots and crew to deliver excellent service and as we continue 
to grow. In addition, I would also like to thank those in support 
functions who have participated in the organisational review 
during the year, which creates a better platform for the future. 
With both of these communities I believe that easyJet is 
building a strong and sustainable advantage for the long term.

DELIVERING OUR STRATEGY

our purposeful growth strategy, which will deliver long-term 
returns to shareholders. As a result, easyJet grew capacity by 
8.5% this year, focusing on reaching strong number one 
positions in Europe’s primary airports. Cost control was robust
