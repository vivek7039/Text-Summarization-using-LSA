At a Glance
At Wilmington plc, we transform knowledge into advantage, keeping our 
clients at the centre of everything we do. In today’s knowledge economy, 
where differentiation using traditional criteria is often difficult, we help our 
clients to better understand their challenges and to use information to 
improve their businesses.
We aspire to treat every client as we would treat our only client; 
we equip our businesses accordingly and provide best-in-
class support and infrastructure. We are innovative, adopting 
new technologies and embracing the digital environment; we 
understand that today’s organisations are as concerned with 
sustaining the pace of change in business generally as they are 
with competition. Throughout Wilmington plc, we are fortunate 
to have highly talented people working in our businesses. 
People whose energy and shared commitment to success drives 
exceptional performance. Wherever in Wilmington plc you look, 
the power of our people, working towards common objectives, 
is immense; we set ourselves demanding goals and we achieve 
them. Consequently, we deliver consistent growth – both 
personal and financial – and aim to deliver increased stakeholder 
value for clients, employees and shareholders alike.
