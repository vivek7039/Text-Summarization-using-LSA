Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
A YEAR OF  
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS
Chairman’s statement
Our position going into the next financial year 
is strong. Our year-end private forward order 
book is at a record level at £242.4m, which, 
combined with a strong pipeline in both 
divisions, positions us well to achieve our 
ambitious growth plans. 
Returns to shareholders
Our share price performed well over the course 
of the financial year, reflecting the performance 
of the business along with continued investor 
education. In the year to 30 September 2017, 
we delivered a total shareholder return of 
46.6 per cent compared to 13.5 per cent for 
the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts). 
With the growth in earnings, our proposed dividend 
per share has also increased by 147 per cent 
with a recommended final dividend per share 
of 5.0 pence. Subject to approval at the AGM 
on 25 January 2018, the dividend will be paid 
on 9 February 2018 to shareholders registered 
at 22 December 2017. T ogether with the interim 
dividend of 3.4 pence per share, this will give a 
total dividend for the year of 8.4 pence per share.
Priorities of the Board
The Board continues to regard corporate 
governance as a core and vital discipline 
complementing our desire to continually improve 
upon the success of the Group on behalf of 
our shareholders. During 2017, particular areas 
of focus were to develop policies and procedures 
to address the new Consumer Code for Home 
Builders and to prepare for the introduction of 
the Criminal Finance Act and the General Data 
Protection Regulation. 
Countryside has delivered another 
year of significant progress completing 
3,389 homes while maintaining a 
strong balance sheet and with 
excellent visibility over our future 
growth ambitions.
Well positioned for growth
During 2017 the business continued to perform 
well, delivering on the key targets set out at 
our initial public offering (“IPO”) in February 
2016. Political support for the housebuilding 
industry remains strong and we welcome the 
Government’s commitment to housing with 
the white paper “Fixing our broken housing 
market” and subsequently announced increased 
funding for both affordable housing and the 
Help to Buy scheme.
At our interim results in May 2017, we upgraded 
the targets that we set out at our IPO as we 
saw opportunities to accelerate delivery on a 
number of our Partnerships sites. We remain 
firmly on track to deliver these targets and indeed 
exceeded our 28 per cent return on capital 
employed (“ROCE”) target in 2017, a year 
ahead of plan. 
We maintained our focus on capital discipline 
and ended the year with £77.4m of net cash 
on the balance sheet. During the year we 
extended our £300m revolving credit facility 
out to May 2022 and we continue to have 
significant headroom. While there are substantial 
plans for investment in our developments during 
2018, our policy remains to be broadly debt 
neutral at the end of each financial year. 
As we enter 2018, our key areas of focus 
continue to be to support implementation 
of the Group’s business strategy, to deepen 
the succession planning for the Board and 
Executive Committee and to ensure that 
corporate governance and risk management 
mitigation plans are embedded across 
the business.
There were two Board changes during the course 
of the year. On 26 May 2017, we announced 
that Oaktree had completed a sale of shares in 
Countryside, reducing its remaining shareholding 
to approximately 23 per cent of the Company’s 
issued share capital. As a consequence, James 
Van Steenkiste stepped down from the Board 
on 5 June 2017 as per the Relationship Agreement 
between Oaktree and the Company. Additionally, 
on 2 October 2017, Richard Adam announced 
his intention to step down as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company, with his last day of 
service being 31 December 2017. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
both James and Richard for their significant 
contributions to the Board and its Committees 
since joining Countryside. The whole Board 
wishes them both well for the future. A search 
for Richard’s successor is well under way and 
an announcement of the appointment will be 
made in due course.
Our people
We recognise that our people are the 
most important factor in delivering on our 
ambitious growth plans and we continue to 
invest in developing them at all levels. As at 
30 September 2017 we had over 1,200 employees , 
12 per cent more than a year ago. We are 
recruiting more apprentices, graduates and 
trainees than ever before. In addition, we have 
placed great focus on succession planning at all 
levels during the year. In May, we were delighted 
to announce the reshaping of our Executive 
Committee following the retirement of Richard 
Cherry, with Ian Kelley, Nick Worrall and Phillip 
Lyons, who joined the business as Chief Executive 
of our Housebuilding division, joining the 
executive team. 
The quality and commitment of our people 
was recognised with a number of awards during 
the year including “Large Housebuilder of the 
Year” at the Housebuilder Awards.
I would like to thank each and every one of our 
employees for their hard work during the course 
of the year.
