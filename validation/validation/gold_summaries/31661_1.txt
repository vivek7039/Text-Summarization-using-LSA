 12 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
— CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
IN SUMMARY
• Outcomes reflect stated intentions 
and unique Master Developer 
licence model.
• EPRA NAV up 7.1 per cent to 
304.4p per share.
• Large site discount starting to 
reverse as forecast. Alconbury and 
Rugby pro-rata discount estimated 
at £99 million, based on CBRE 
150-unit parcels. Equivalent to 
68p per share against 71p per 
share at March 2017.
• Practical advantages of Master 
Developer facilitating large-scale 
residential build strengthened by 
our five-year licences that are capital 
efficient to housebuilders but which 
require minimum annual payments 
that transparently underwrite annual 
forward receipts to Urban&Civic. 
• Post balance sheet events reinforce 
clarity: switch from Stansted Hotel 
into Priors Hall. Meanwhile, political 
mathematics direct increasingly 
towards large sites, witness housing 
reset in the Autumn Budget.
• Increased final dividend of 
2p per share, recognising 
progress and positive outlook. 
Full year 3.2p per share: up 
10.3 per cent. 
NIGEL HUGILL — CHIEF EXE CUTIVE
No silver bullet but 
significant positives.
Introduction
Good results. Significant positives to our enlarging business 
base underlined by further advantageous post balance sheet 
transactions and public pronouncements. EPRA net assets 
per share were up 7 .1 per cent to 304.4p as at 30 September 2017 . 
EPRA net assets reached £439.3 million, as compared with 
£409.8 million at 30 September 2016. Unlike last year , the growth 
was divided pretty equally across the two periods. Reported 
pre‑ tax profits of £7.9 million, whilst down on £25.9 million in 
the 12 months to 30 September 2016, also showed a maturing 
profile. Residential property sales contributed £5.7 million to 
profits and will rise from here. Post balance sheet sales of the 
bulk of the remaining commercial assets aggregating £70 million 
will lift pre‑ tax profits above trend in the first half of the 
current year.
The core reason for establishing Urban&Civic was to provide 
new housing choices and accelerate supply through Master 
Development. In accordance with our strategy, that involves 
creating environments in which people actively want to live 
and a delivery structure that encourages speed and quality 
from those housebuilders looking to expand output. Our results 
demonstrate the extent to which the Master Developer 
model can be seen to be working financially as well as 
philosophically. The recent commercial asset realisations 
reflect the determination of the Board to position the balance 
sheet in the direction that the Company holds clear competitive 
advantage. A proportion of sales proceeds was redeployed 
almost immediately in the acquisition of Priors Hall in 
Northamptonshire at a cost of £40.5 million. Buying from 
administrators is never straightforward and our new project 
purchase demonstrates the ability of Urban&Civic to work 
through large site challenges that other developers often 
find too daunting.
Following the off‑ market purchase earlier in the year of a 
33 per cent equity interest in the near 3,000 unit Wintringham 
project at St Neots, Cambridgeshire, there can be no mistaking 
where your Company has set its stall. The 400‑ acre site had 
been in the ownership of trusts associated with Nuffield College, 
Oxford, since the 1940s and was bequeathed by the late Lord 
Nuffield. Urban&Civic has taken charge of project delivery with 
a collective determination that the partnership can provide an 
appropriate financial and environmental legacy. The related 
opportunity lies in the prospect of taking our Master Developer 
model and harnessing the Nuffield experience of creating 
healthier lifestyles to show just what well‑ structured new 
large‑ scale projects can contribute when improved wellbeing 
is prioritised from the outset. 13 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  14 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Much of the difference in relative performance 
comes from careful project selection in the 
more affordable locations within 100 miles 
of London, supported by good transport 
links and recognised demographics of 
high employment and population growth. 
The remainder is grounded on disciplined 
on‑ site procedures honed over 30 years 
of large and complex project delivery. 
We have learnt our ways from commercial 
development and we are sticking with them. 
Our Master Developer differentiator is 
paving the way for new policy assumptions 
in the process. Following recent commercial 
asset sales, substantively all Group project 
loans are ten‑ year facilities from the 
UK Government’s Homes and Communities 
Agency. The recent National Infrastructure 
Commission recommendations followed 
by the November Budget could not have 
been more categoric as to the requirement 
for additional strategic housing provision 
across a brain belt between Cambridge and 
Oxford. There is nobody better equipped 
in this country to deliver in those areas and 
at that scale than Urban&Civic.
No real negatives to report, other than 
perhaps, the pipeline of Catesby 
monetisations has become a little held up 
including by post‑ appeal judicial challenges. 
Introduction continued
Adjusting for post balance sheet disposals 
and the acquisition of Priors Hall, 80 per cent 
of property assets of the Company are 
now invested in strategic projects with a 
further 6 per cent in Catesby. I can also 
relay increasing enthusiasm amongst 
our housebuilder customers as to the 
reciprocal benefits of the Urban&Civic 
Master Developer model. Your Company 
is absolutely succeeding in setting aside the 
shibboleths too often attaching to strategic 
residential sites in the past. Our projects are 
rigorously managed with key infrastructure, 
schools, cycleways, footpaths, roads, planting 
and playgrounds all delivered early to reduce 
any sense of pioneering amongst incoming 
residents. Our licences encourage housing 
quality and the signs are that delivery will 
be faster. We are on track to double historic 
industry averages. 15 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

Master Developer and security of income
As Master Developer, Urban&Civic retains 
project responsibility and licenses fully serviced 
plots in typical lot sizes of 150 to 200, ready 
for the housebuilders to commence early 
construction. We receive around one‑ third 
of sales value when houses are sold; subject 
to the underpinning condition that we are 
paid a minimum annual drawdown, typically 
35 to 40 plots per year, at fixed prices 
irrespective. Our housebuilder customers 
can accelerate sales and payments to us 
but they cannot slow down beyond the 
contracted minimums. Put another way, 
our licence arrangements see us sell 
roughly five years forward for a basic 
consideration paid annually plus overage. 
Urban&Civic is acting as wholesaler to our 
housebuilder customers but with better 
security over contracted income.
We are now five years forward sold 
across four sites to a range of successful 
housebuilders with licence participations 
or overage in practically all instances. 
First agreements have been contracted 
with Avant and Bellway at Newark and will 
contribute a further minimum £2.8 million 
per year . Meanwhile, receipts from contracted 
sales at Priors Hall were estimated on 
acquisition at approximately £11.8 million, 
of which £4.2 million is expected to be 
received in the current financial year. 
With the addition of Priors Hall receipts, 
contracted sales are expected to raise 
around £17.0 million in the current year, 
on flat house price assumptions. It is that 
security of income, in combination with 
the potential for accelerated delivery, 
which underwrites our confidence to 
realise commercial assets for further 
reinvestment into strategic projects.
The likelihood is that we will have at least 
17 separate agreements with housebuilders 
at the March 2018 interim stage. We delayed 
the start of our own building to allow our 
primary customers first run. The Civic Living 
designs are more contemporary and will 
feature a higher proportion of apartments. 
We are confident they will help broaden 
the product mix alongside housebuilders 
already on site. Construction has begun 
at Alconbury to be followed by Rugby and 
Newark in the first half of 2018.
Operating highlights 
The principal operating highlights during 
the year were the start on site at Alconbury 
of Morris Homes and Redrow, with 
continuing strong sales from Hopkins 
Homes, (53 completions and a further 15 
reservations or exchanges from start on site 
in April 2016), and the Davidson’s show house 
now being open at Rugby (15 reservations), 
with construction having also commenced 
by Crest Nicholson and Morris Homes. 
Avant Homes are building at Newark and 
Bellway will follow shortly. Two new parcels 
are under negotiation at Alconbury and 
preliminary agreements with at least two 
more housebuilders will be reached at 
Wintringham early in the new year. There 
are seven housebuilders of varying sizes 
on site for the first phase of Priors Hall.  16 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

a shortfall in new UK housing construction. 
Were there a silver bullet it would most 
certainly have been fired by now, given the 
meticulous search for a weapon. We are 
currently adding about half a million people 
a year to the national population, of which 
just less than one‑ third is net immigration 
from the European Union. The Office for 
National Statistics has revised down 
population forecasts but still expects 
population numbers to exceed 70 million 
before the end of the next decade. The 20‑year 
growth average is around 0.5 per cent per year . 
It is also as well to remind ourselves as 
to the exceptional nature of the challenge 
(and what I see as the corresponding business 
opportunity). The sustained UK population 
growth is unmatched in any of the major 
European economies. Equally, our 
unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent and 
working age employment ratio of 75.0 per cent 
are genuinely remarkable. Our country is 
one of the world’s great workplaces. 
One can argue about the quality but there 
can be no disputing that England, at least, 
has been a job‑ creating machine over the 
past decade.
Post balance sheet sales
Whilst after the year end, the effective switch 
of a part of the sales receipts from the recently 
completed Hampton by Hilton Hotel at 
Stansted Airport into the acquisition of 
Priors Hall warrants specific comment. 
The sale of the hotel, which only opened 
for trading in July 2017 , was an obviously 
strong outcome for the Group. The minimum 
consideration of £48.3 million represented a 
projected yield on stabilised EBITDA three 
years forward of 6.75 per cent and was 
15 per cent higher than the EPRA valuation 
of the completed asset in the interim balance 
sheet as at 31 March 2017. Profit realised 
on actual cost is in the order of £8.5 million. 
Cash returned back into the business, after 
accounting for development project bank 
debt, exceeded £30.0 million. An additional 
sum of up to £1.1 million will be paid to 
Urban&Civic, depending upon operational 
performance over the next two years. The signs 
are that we will receive at least a percentage. 
Initial occupancy levels and achieved room 
rates are running above pre‑ opening 
forecasts. The subsequent sale of Feethams 
in Darlington realised a further £22 million, 
representing £8 million after repayment of 
secured debt. The September 2017 EPRA 
balance sheet takes account of the realised 
values, using the minimum consideration in 
the case of Stansted. Additional commercial 
disposals remain in train.
Acquisition of Priors Hall, 
Northamptonshire
If we have sold well, we have to believe that 
we have bought better. The Priors Hall 
transaction represents an important business 
win on a project that we have monitored 
closely for several years. The acquisition 
of 965 acres of partly built land is right in 
the Urban&Civic sweet spot: chequered 
history, long and supportive funding structure, 
demonstrable potential for better project 
organisation and improved planning. Plus 
the demographic fundamentals are attractive: 
28 per cent population growth over the past 
15 years with seven million people living 
within 50 miles. Recent house price growth 
in the local area is amongst the highest in 
the country, no doubt boosted by a 68 minute 
direct rail service to London. Priors Hall has 
been achieving sales of around 200 new homes 
a year despite being under managed and 
over leveraged. The scheme will benefit 
from the love and attention that it has 
begun already to receive. Our skills and 
experience as incoming Master Developer 
confer competitive advantage for which we 
expect to be rewarded with superior returns.
Housing by numbers
A virtual forest of newspaper columns and 
no few analysts’ commentaries have sought 
to address the causes and consequences of  17 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
S
The aspect that is often overlooked is the 
extent to which population and employment 
growth has become concentrated. The 
consequence is that population increases 
within 100 miles of London are sometimes 
double those of the headline national rate. 
Nor are the highest numbers limited to the 
capital. As examples, recent population 
growth in Cambridge and Peterborough 
has exceeded that of London. Compound 
one to two per cent growth over ten years 
and the increase is often 15 per cent. This 
is of a quite different scale from almost all 
provincial European locations.
Carrying that exposition further, a local 
authority in Southern England normally  
has around 170,000 residents. Simple 
mathematics are that 15 per cent growth  
in ten years adds 25,000 people. 
London and a few other overbought locations, 
renting is more expensive than buying 
leaving access to the deposit as the remaining 
hurdle to ownership. To that end and despite 
the interest rate rise, we should enter 2018 
in slightly better shape than one may have 
expected earlier in the year. Mortgage 
approvals are likely to be up over the year 
and transactions about 5 per cent higher. 
Borrowing costs remain historically low, 
employment levels show no signs of going 
down and income growth in the wider 
economy is likely to drift upwards as the 
labour market tightens. 
Following a hesitant recovery, housebuilding 
activity has picked up steadily in recent years. 
This has been most apparent in the period 
since the introduction of the Help to Buy 
scheme in 2013. Measured on a 12‑ month 
rolling basis, housebuilding is running at 
around 170,000 new constructions a year, 
still less than 1 per cent of existing stock. 
For this ratio to return to its long‑ term 
average, housing starts would need to 
increase to around 220,000 per annum. 
In short, all roads lead to new build, for 
the foreseeable future, as Help to Buy 
supports the marginal buyer.
Help to Buy
Help to Buy was designed to do what it said 
on the tin: to provide assistance to home 
buyers by increasing the supply of low‑ deposit 
mortgages. Since the scheme was introduced 
in April 2013, the value of Help to Buy equity 
loans has totalled £6.75 billion while the value 
of the properties bought within the scheme 
has been around £32 billion. This is equivalent 
to 4 to 5 per cent of all mortgage loans for 
house purchases over this period but a much 
higher percentage of new builds. Moreover, 
utilisation is increasing. In the year to June 
2017, there were around 43,000 Help to Buy 
completions. This was up from around 35,000 
in the same period a year earlier. The average 
property price within the scheme has been 
around £240,000. Without the scheme 
first‑ time buyers especially would be denied 
access to the mortgage market, despite 
relative affordability. It should come as 
no surprise that it was extended.
On standard occupation assumptions,  
that requires 10,000 new dwellings over  
the same period. Our conclusion is that  
the most practical way of meeting that 
requirement is to bring forward more  
big sites and to have them deliver faster.  
Now that we are five years forward sold  
to a spread of housebuilders on the initial 
parcels on our consented sites and carry 
strong backing from the Homes and 
Communities Agency, we can direct the 
balance sheet without betting the business.

The comparison is not so direct at Priors Hall 
in Northamptonshire, where we acquired 
an existing over leveraged project in 
administration. Urban&Civic has owned 
the project for just over a month but I am 
pleased to be able to inform shareholders 
that the signs are already good.
Planning normally constitutes firm ground 
for Urban&Civic but the identification of 
immediate priorities is not in any way to 
gainsay the importance of continuing to 
deliver quality and accelerated numbers 
at Alconbury, Rugby and Newark and to 
bring Priors Hall up to scratch. Quality 
delivery is a necessary accompanying 
condition in superseding the historically 
sedate rates of sale too often witnessed on 
large scale sites elsewhere. Our commitment 
includes the clearly stated intent to deliver 
a tangible dividend to the stakeholders and 
communities with which we work. We have 
sought to augment our reputation on this 
by establishing and testing some 
repeatable metrics.
Finally, the acquisition of Priors Hall in the 
course of development and the likely pace 
to delivery at Wintringham enables us to 
look to establish a chronology that includes 
new major schemes at initial commencement. 
Shareholders can be assured that we will 
only be taking on projects where the realistic 
expectation is for much faster delivery 
under our stewardship than has been the 
third party average in the past. The recent 
National Infrastructure Commission Report, 
immediately followed by the Budget, both 
require the rapid delivery of new large sites 
to achieve the housing numbers required in 
South East England. Our Master Developer 
model is halving the time from outline 
planning to start on site and thereafter 
we are on track to double historic rates 
of delivery. This is transformational to 
project economics and political credibility. 
Your Company is shortlisted or actively 
evaluating a number of significant new 
projects including opportunities along 
the Cambridge to Oxford Corridor. 
Should we achieve planning consent at 
Wintringham and Waterbeach in the current 
financial year, with at least one/two new 
strategic scale projects to come alongside, 
that would meet the previous target that we 
set ourselves of having 40,000 residential 
dwellings with Urban&Civic as Master 
Developer. Moreover, in that eventuality, 
three‑ quarters of all units would be consented. 
Catesby
There are frustrations around consented 
applications obtained by Catesby for 
790 dwellings in high growth areas, 
languishing in the judicial process. In one 
instance, the earliest a Court of Appeal 
date could be scheduled is for April 2018, 
some 20 months after the initial grant of 
planning consent in August 2016. We will, 
however , continue to account for the trading 
profits on realised sales only as they 
come through.
The competitive position of Catesby is 
strengthened by specialist expertise and 
the ability to infrastructure. The environment 
for promotions is becoming more challenging, 
both in terms of the margins being bid on 
smaller projects and in appeal decisions on 
five‑ year land supply. Consistent with broader 
Group priorities, Catesby is responding 
to changing market conditions in the land 
promotion market by targeting larger 
projects of up to 2,000 dwellings. 
Immediate priorities
One of the most pleasing aspects of your 
Company’s performance over the past 
12 months has been the manner in which 
we have been able to fulfil the immediate 
priorities articulated this time last year. 
We were able to add two important new 
projects to our portfolio and submit a planning 
application at Waterbeach, three miles north 
of the Cambridge Science and Business Parks 
which is arguably the most significant 
application being processed in the country 
at the present time.
The focus for 2018 is to secure approval for 
the submitted applications at Waterbeach 
and Wintringham, comprehensively revisit 
the assumptions for future development at 
Priors Hall and do what we can to unblock 
the prevarications that have log jammed 
consented Catesby projects that would 
otherwise be helping to add to national 
housing numbers. We are also evaluating 
making an application to open up a new 
area of 1,500+ further dwellings at 
Alconbury, which is consistent with the 
emerging Local Plan for Huntingdonshire.
We acquired our interest in the near 3,000 unit 
scheme at Wintringham in St Neots, 
Cambridgeshire, in April and submitted 
a hybrid planning application in October. 
My expectation is for a resolution to grant 
in the first quarter of 2018. Such is our growing 
reputation that housebuilder customers are 
prepared now to invest time and resources 
in working up designs ahead of consent. 
As a result we have a decent shot at getting 
foundations in the ground for contracted 
partners before the end of next year. In stark 
contrast, recent reports describe the period 
from submission of outline planning consent 
through to the delivery of first dwelling is 
typically approaching seven years for sites 
above 2,000 units. Urban&Civic as Master 
Developer is shaking those prevailing 
assumptions to their very core. Wintringham 
ought to be our fastest yet: we are on track 
to come in around 24 months from formal 
planning application submission to first 
housing delivery.  19 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

the effective applied discount for strategic 
scale remains considerable. Using CBRE 
assumptions, the corresponding large site 
discount can be calculated at £99 million at 
September 2017 , equivalent to 68p per share, 
in addition to our reported EPRA NAV figure. 
This figure has started to reverse at Alconbury 
and Rugby and ought to become more 
incorporated in base valuations as the 
pace of sales increases and our valuers 
are able to factor in greater corroboration. 
The estimated September 2017 discount 
is higher than the equivalent figures last 
year (September 2016: £91 million, or 
60p per share) but lower than our interim 
(March 2017: £103 million, or 7.1p per share). 
In the meantime, maintained housing demand 
ought to be sufficient to ensure that net cash 
proceeds under our sales arrangements 
realise better than 2x current EPRA 
September 2017 plot values, even on 
completely flat house price assumptions.
Dividend
The final dividend of 2.0p per share 
maintains the stated policy of increasing 
annual dividends by 10 per cent when the 
performance of the Company and the 
Board’s estimation of future prospects 
is seen as warranting such. There will be a 
scrip dividend alternative for which I shall 
again be electing.
Continuing thanks
The outcomes this year underlined by the 
pace of progress in recent weeks speak 
loudly to the commitment and dedication 
of Board and staff colleagues alike. It is 
most gratifying to report that our collective 
judgements appear to be proving sound. 
It is a privilege and a delight to be part of 
such a team. We are far from finished yet.
Nigel Hugill
Chief Executive

In addition, Catesby is promoting 
10,000 new units on its own account and 
on behalf of third parties, which would lift 
the total to 50,000 prospective new dwellings 
overall. We are not about to get ahead of 
ourselves and will reset our targets only 
when the existing objectives are met. Internal 
governance has been strengthened with the 
formalisation of the Executive Management 
Committee, reporting directly to your Board, 
which establishes a broad and efficient corporate 
structure for risk management, delivery 
and future growth.
Outlook
Unusually for the property sector, there are 
very few qualifications in relation to the 
near‑ term outlook of your Company. 
In terms of the markets in which we operate, 
overall levels of housing activity have generally 
been more resilient than had been expected 
in the period since the EU referendum. 
Across all regions, house price inflation has 
been steady at around 5 per cent during 
2017. Outside London, house price inflation 
is broadly stable while housing transactions 
have been trending gently upwards. This 
confidence is reflected by housebuilders 
continuing to enter into contracts with 
Urban&Civic containing minimal annual 
commitments that extend well beyond 
the Brexit horizon.
Measures of affordability that capture the 
impact of lower borrowing costs have improved 
considerably since the recession. Across all 
regions, it has been estimated that initial 
mortgage payments for first‑ time buyers 
are currently equivalent to about a third of 
average post‑ tax earnings. This compares 
with a peak of over 50 per cent in 2007/08. 
Reflecting this, the number of first‑ time 
buyers has increased from a recession 
low of around 150,000 to around 350,000. 
The abolition of stamp duty for that group 
of purchasers on properties of up to £300,000 
can only assist sales on our sites at present. 
With high employment and borrowing costs 
remaining at historic lows, overall levels 
of housing market activity are, in my view, 
likely to trend upwards. The reasonable 
expectation is for house prices rising broadly 
in line with average earnings over the 
medium term and housing transactions 
rising further.
Your Company has been blazing its own 
trail towards the creation of a new asset 
class for licence sales on strategic projects. 
The resulting lack of comparable transactional 
evidence continues to provide challenges 
to our valuers. They are starting to nudge 
down the discount rates applied to contracted 
sales. Nevertheless, the gap between their 
starting point of the current appraised 
open market value of 150–200 plots and
