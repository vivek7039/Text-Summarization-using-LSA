Strategic Report
SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE
Group revenue increased by 6.2% to 
£294.0m (FY2016: £276.9m). Bespak 
delivered growth of 3.3% to £121.1m 
(FY2016: £117.2m) while Aesica 
revenue grew by 8.2% to £172.9m 
(FY2016: £159.7m). The Group achieved 
underlying growth of 2.0% at constant 
exchange rates.
EBIT before special items increased by 
8.3% to £40.0m (FY2016: £37.0m) and 
by 4.1% at constant exchange rates. 
This included 3.9% growth from Bespak 
to £26.1m (FY2016: £25.2m) which 
continues to deliver strong operating 
leverage on higher revenues. Bespak 
EBIT margin increased by 10bps to 
21.6%. Aesica EBIT increased 17.7% to 
£13.9m, with EBIT margin growing 60bps 
to 8.0% reflecting improved underlying 
operating performance. 
Special items before tax were £13.7m 
in the year (FY2016: £21.0m), largely 
comprising charges associated with the 
acquisition of businesses with: £13.0m 
of amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles (FY2016: £13.1m); £0.2m of 
advisory and acquisition costs (FY2016: 
£1.4m) and £0.5m of reorganisation 
costs (FY2016: £6.5m).
Finance costs were £4.5m (FY2016: 
£4.7m) benefiting from a reduction in 
interest on borrowings. Group earnings 
before tax and special items increased 
by 10.4% to £35.6m (FY2016: £32.3m). 
Adjusted basic EPS increased by 13.1% 
to 65.1p (FY2016: 57.6p). Basic EPS 
increased by 50.5% to 46.2p  
(FY2016: 30.7p).
Cash generated from operations before 
special items decreased by £2.6m 
to £51.5m (FY2016: £54.1m). EBITDA 
before special items grew £4.4m (9.1%) 
to £52.7m (FY2016: £48.3m). Bespak 
EBITDA grew 5.6% to £32.1m, with Aesica 
growing 15.0% to £20.6m. Working 
capital decreased by £0.5m to £13.5m 
(FY2016: £14.0m). Capital expenditure of 
£18.1m (FY2016: £21.5m) included £6.6m 
from Bespak (FY2016: £12.7m) and 
£11.5m from Aesica (FY2016: £8.8m).
The Group balance sheet closed with 
a net debt position of £92.6m (FY2016: 
£97.0m), representing gearing of 
1.7x Net debt: EBITDA. This reduction 
in gearing is in line with our strategy 
and comfortably within the banking 
facility covenant (maximum 3.0x). The 
Group has comfortable cash resource 
availability with total committed 
facilities of £166.6m.
The Board is proposing an increased 
final dividend of 13.21p (FY2016: 12.56p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 
20.30p (FY2016: 19.31p).
FURTHER INVESTMENT IN  
ATLAS GENETICS
In January 2017, Consort subscribed 
for a further £3.1m equity investment 
in Atlas Genetics Ltd (“Atlas”) as part 
of a £28.4m Series D funding. Atlas is a 
diagnostic company developing ultra-
rapid point of care tests for a range of 
infectious diseases. Consort now holds 
a 15.2% shareholding in Atlas (13.4% on 
a fully diluted basis) having invested a 
total to date of £9.4m in the company.
This investment followed Atlas 
Genetics’ successful CE marking for the 
Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT) io
®
  
test cartridge and the funding was 
raised to finance the continued 
development of the combined 
Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea (CT/NG) 
assay and test cartridge. This is planned 
for regulatory approvals in the US and 
Europe around early 2018. The equity 
raise also provides funding to expand 
manufacturing capacity at Bespak, 
which is Atlas’ development, and 
manufacturing partner. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR PERFORMANCE
Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
CONTINUED
Bespak has a well-established and 
diverse core business of products in 
volume manufacturing with a strong 
pipeline of innovative products. 
These products include: respiratory, 
nasal, ocular and injectable drug 
delivery, as well as point of care 
diagnostics. Once again, the business 
has grown in the year supported by 
the commercialisation of two of its 
development pipeline projects.
Revenue grew 3.3% to £121.1m with 
Bespak’s leading respiratory products 
continuing to perform well and strong 
growth of the injectables business. 
The Group’s diversification strategy to 
reduce its dependence on respiratory 
products has made good progress with 
non-respiratory sales now at 21% of 
revenue (compared to 8% in 2012). 
Bespak grew revenue despite the 
impact of a lower level of activity with 
Nicovations due to the termination 
of the supply agreement. This 
demonstrates the strength of the 
business through its broad range of 
programmes. Service revenue also 
continued its strong contribution 
given the growing development and 
innovation pipelines.
The good revenue performance 
translated to EBIT growth, which 
increased 3.9% to £26.1m, as EBIT margin 
increased 10bps to 21.6%.
In October 2016, Bespak exhibited 
alongside Aesica at the CPHI exhibition 
in Barcelona. This was the second  
time both companies have shared a 
major industry exhibition platform,  
and the event drew increased interest 
in the joint service offering of device 
and drug.
Product Development
In line with our strategy we have 
assembled a full and broad product 
development pipeline of underlying 
growth opportunities, which 
supplements the strong core business 
going forward. Successful conversion 
of these opportunities will provide 
progressive revenue and profit growth, 
in both contract manufacturing and 
products with our own proprietary IP. 
This is across a range of therapeutic 
areas, including commercial  
drug handling.
Our published development portfolio 
provides an update on the key business 
development projects in the business. 
We guide that for inclusion in the 
published portfolio, projects must have 
a reasonable expectation of success, 
though timescales are difficult to 
predict, and are expected to produce 
peak annual sales of at least £3m  
per annum. 
In the period, UCB received regulatory 
approval from the European Medicines 
Agency for INJ570, an auto-injector  
for UCB’s Cimzia
®
, which was 
successfully launched in the UK. The 
product has also been launched in 
other European markets.
Bespak also entered into a landmark 
commercial supply agreement for 
Bespak’s proprietary respiratory devices 
with AstraZeneca AB (referred to as 
project VAL100). This is a multi-year 
agreement for the scale up and supply 
of Bespak’s proprietary pressurised 
metered dose inhaler (pMDI) valves and 
actuators. These have been assembled 
with AstraZeneca’s Bevespi Aerosphere
®
 
(glycopyrrolate and formoterol 
fumarate) inhalation aerosol indicated 
for the long term maintenance 
treatment of airflow obstruction in 
patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), including 
bronchitis and/or emphysema. 
AstraZeneca announced that its device 
was approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) on 25 April 2016 
and the Bevespi Aerosphere
®
 has now 
been launched in the US.
We have also signed a significant new 
master agreement for our proprietary 
Vapoursoft
®
 Syrina
®
 auto-injector 
technology (project SYR075) with a 
leading global biopharmaceutical 
company. Initially there is a single 
drug/device combination, but the 
agreement allows for the addition of 
others, and contains outline terms for 
commercial supply.
Bespak has made good progress on 
DEV610 where it is working with Mylan in 
developing a generic Advair product. 
Mylan has announced that they are in 
discussion with the FDA following receipt 
of a Complete Response Letter as part 
of the regulatory process. 
Inevitably, not all of Consort’s 
development projects reach 
commercial launch, and on 3 January 
2017 we announced that Nicovations 
had terminated its supply agreements 
with Bespak for Voke
®
, exercising its 
contractual right in the event that 
Voke was not commercially launched 
before 31 December 2016. Confidential 
settlement terms have since been 
agreed with Nicovations.

to 33 people (22 as at FY2016) at our 
dedicated facilities in Cambridge.
The commercial and innovation 
teams continue to generate very 
strong interest in our new technology 
platforms on a range of opportunities. 
The innovation funnel has progressed 
broadly during the period across a 
number of therapeutic areas and 
technologies. These development 
and feasibility programmes cover a 
range of therapeutic areas and are 
all in partnership with biotech and 
pharmaceutical companies. These 
complement our current customer 
portfolio in our core business. This is 
again indicative of the strength and

 AR 2.25 
Auto-injector
In October 2016, Bespak unveiled 
its Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 auto-injector. This 
innovative auto-injector is the latest 
addition to the Vapoursoft
®
 powered 
Syrina
®
 range and is suitable for 
delivering volumes of up to 2.0ml using 
a standard 2.25ml pre-filled syringe. The 
Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 provides patients with 
a fully-automatic two-step, compact 
device for self-administration of viscous 
drug formulations.
Bespak’s proprietary Vapoursoft
®
 
compact energy source is able to 
deliver 2.0ml of viscous drug solutions 
smoothly and safely in less than 15 
seconds. Designed with a hidden 
needle, Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 offers automatic 
needle insertion and retraction, as well 
as drug delivery with a single push-on-
skin operation. Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 has  
been tailored specifically for higher 
viscosities while still enabling the safe 
use of glass syringes.
Using Vapoursoft
®
 at its core allows 
a compact design and, with quiet 
operation, provides a discrete solution 
for patients. Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 is clinical 
trial ready, enabling a fast track 
implementation process once paired 
with a specific drug formulation. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR PERFORMANCE
Strategic Report
Aesica revenue grew 8.2% to £172.9m, 
which included underlying growth of 
£1.6m (1.0%) at constant exchange 
rates. The division has continued to 
make solid progress in the year in 
improving its operating performance 
and EBIT margin. EBIT in FY2017 grew 
by 17.7% to £13.9m, with EBIT margin 
growing by 60bps to 8.0%. Underlying 
profit growth was £0.5m (4.5%) at 
constant exchange rates.  
This includes improvements in 
operational performance across the 
network from upgrades to teams and 
processes as well as an improvement in 
the product mix. 
We are now routinely supplying 
commercial product using the first 
semi-continuous processing line 
and technology installed at the 
Queenborough site and we anticipate 
using this line for additional third party 
development work in the future.
Aesica has moved from validation to 
routine supply of S+ flurbiprofen to a 
leading Japanese pharmaceutical 
company to provide the active 
ingredient for an anti-inflammatory 
formulation.
Aesica attaches a very high priority 
to maintaining a solid track record of 
compliance in an evolving regulatory 
environment. During the year two sites 
were subject to routine FDA audits and 
the observations raised have been 
addressed and shared across other 
sites. Aesica continues to focus on 
safety in the work environment and 
there has been a further reduction in its 
lost time accident rate over the last  
12 months.
Business Development  
and Innovation
We are beginning to see the benefits 
of restructuring our sales and marketing 
activities, although the lead times in 
our industry can be long. We recently 
signed a contract extension with one 
of our major customers and have seen 
some diversification of our customer 
base in some geographies towards 
speciality pharma which is providing 
further opportunities for growth. 
We are in receipt of significant orders 
from a European speciality pharma 
customer to manufacture proprietary 
API following a technically challenging 
validation exercise. 
Recent contract wins with regional 
pharma companies demonstrate 
that our commitment to operational 
performance, customer focus and a 
more targeted business development 
effort across Europe is beginning to 
generate returns. The increase in the 
number of potential opportunities 
we are seeing provides us with an 
encouraging backdrop to secure 
further growth.
A changing regulatory requirement 
within the pharmaceutical industry is for 
products to be uniquely identifiable at 
the individual pack level. This process 
is known in the industry as serialisation. 
Aesica has been an early provider 
of serialisation services to the industry 
including China and Latin America that 
have adopted this process. It is also well 
advanced in developing the service 
for the next wave of territories adopting 
serialisation including the EU. We believe 
Aesica is in a strong position relative 
to the sector in general and we have 
been actively promoting this offering 
with marketing and industry events 
such as a recent webinar series. Further 
capital expenditure is being committed 
to enhance our capabilities in this area.
Pipeline
Aesica is primarily focused on two pools 
of business development: development 
services and manufacturing services, 
with some overlap between the two.
• Development services applies 
to know-how in API/formulation 
development to a wide range of 
project opportunities for a wide range 
of customers at differing stages of the 
clinical trial cycle
• Manufacturing services revenue 
mainly comes from the application 
of its process technology and know-
how to specific API and drug product 
manufacturing opportunities. Many 
of these may be different from 
those API/formulation development 
opportunities
The Aesica commercial team is focused 
on a growing pipeline of API/formulation 
development opportunities supported 
by our ability to meet customer needs 
across a number of technology 
offerings. This includes an opportunity for 
API and formulation development that 
could lead to commercial manufacture 
and packaging of finished products  
for patients.
