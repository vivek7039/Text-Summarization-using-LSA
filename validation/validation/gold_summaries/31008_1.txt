The wealth management sector  
remains robust 
The wealth management industry continues to be an exciting  
and rapidly changing place to do business. In 2017, the industry  
has not only had to navigate a particularly uncertain political 
climate, but has also had to respond to a considerable amount  
of new regulation.  
Importantly, many positive drivers for long-term private wealth 
accumulation are still in place. The challenge the current climate 
brings is to secure the scale economies and operational efficiencies 
necessary to respond positively to demographic changes and 
technological advances, whilst reacting to a climate of increasing 
price pressure.  
In this respect, Rathbones contin ues to be well positioned in  
the industry with our own funds under management reaching 
£39.1 billion at 31 December 2017, up 14.3% from £34.2 billion at the 
end of 2016. Total funds under management in our Investment 
Management business at 31 December 2017 were £33.8 billion, up 
11.9% from £30.2 billion in 2016, whilst our Unit Trusts business 
reached a milestone of £5.3 billion, up 32.5% from last year.  
Strong financial performance underpinned 
by a 30% operating margin 
Despite investing in a number of areas across the business during 
the year, we maintained a leading operating margin of 30.6%  
(2016: 29.8%) through a combination of relatively supportive 
investment markets and continued net funds growth and cost 
discipline. Underlying profit before tax totalled £87.5 million  
(2016: £74.9 million), generating an underlying earnings per share 
of 138.8p, an increase of 13 .7% from 122.1p in 2016.  
In 2017, the group added £4.8 billion gross funds under 
management organically, split between £3.1 billion in our 
Investment Management business and £1.7 billion in our Unit 
Trusts business (2016: £2.3 billion and £1.3 billion respectively). 
Outflows from intergenerational wealth transfer, property 
purchases and other uses of funds to support lifestyle continue 
unabated in this low interest rate environment. Net organic 
growth in this business was 3.0% (2016: 2.9%), which represents a 
satisfactory result in an investment climate that was largely 
directionless until the end of the year. Net flows into our Unit 
Trusts business were very strong however, totalling £883 million 
in the year (2016: £554 million) and helping its total funds under 
management to reach a record £5.3 billion (2016: £4.0 billion)  
at 31 December 2017.  
Profit before tax for the year of £58.9 million was 17.6% higher than 
the £50.1 million in 2016 and reflects the impact of a number of 
non-underlying items. A full analysis of these items can be found 
on page 31. 
As reported on page 116, our balance sheet remains stable with a 
consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 31 December 2017 of 
20.7% compared with 17.7% at 31 December 2016. Our consolidated 
leverage ratio at 31 December 2017 was 7.8% compared with 6.6% 
at 31 December 2016. We remain a capital-efficient business, 
generating an underlying return on capital employed of 19.5% for 
the year compared to 19.3% a year ago. A detailed analysis of our 
regulatory capital position at 31 December 2017 can be found on 
page 38.

The journey to £40 billion has significantly 
improved our capabilities as a firm 
Four years ago, I shared an ambition for the firm to reach  
£40 billion of funds under management by the end of 2018,  
and I am encouraged that this goal is within our reach. Since 2014, 
we have delivered a significantly improved investment platform 
to support our investment teams, built new distribution channels 
addressing both IFA networks and professional intermediaries, 
acquired Vision Independent Financial Planning, expanded our 
research and specialist investment capabilities, simplified our 
pricing structures and materially grown our Unit Trusts business. 
We have also delivered learning and development programmes to 
employees, strengthened our brand profile, improved our website 
and broadened our marketing capability.  
Alongside this demanding programme, we have taken advantage 
of a number of opportunities to deliver inorganic growth through 
team hiring and bolt-on acquisitions. Our culture of ‘professional 
autonomy with accountability’ on which our investment 
managers thrive, remains very much at the heart of our business, 
but does place more demands on our ability to manage risk. Hand 
in hand with this considerable level of activity, we have ensured 
that we continue to operate a risk and control framework that 
allows us to adhere to our core philosophies of delivering an 
investment-led, highly personal, whole of market investment 
service to our clients.  
Investing in the future  
There are, of course, areas of the business that we must continue 
to develop to adapt to the changing needs of our clients. This year, 
we have been reviewing the processes we use to maintain and 
manage information about our clie nts, and have made a number 
of enhancements. In 2017, we embedded a new way of capturing 
and evaluating our clients’ attitude to investment risk and 
significantly increased the usage of asset allocation tools across  
the firm, with over 97% of discretionary funds now linked to  
these tools.  
In 2018, we will continue to keep abreast of evolving client 
suitability standards. We will also be looking to improve our 
account opening processes, making use of a material upgrade to 
our client relationship management systems and providing more 
administrative support to ensure that investment teams can 
continue to focus on serving our clients well.  
The output from our research team has increased considerably 
over the last two years, as has access to this output, through the 
introduction of a research hub, which disseminates information to 
our growing community of investment managers. In 2018, we will 
continue to ensure that we attract the right level of investment 
skills to support and develop our in vestment process, but, just as 
importantly, ensure that the amount of external research we 
procure is right for us. MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments 
Directive) has made some signif icant changes to the way in  
which external research is priced, delivered and administered,  
and we will work hard to keep abreast of developments to secure 
value for money.  
Building our presence in the inte rmediary market has remained a 
key priority, so a May 2017 report by Defaqto, which confirmed 
that the use of Rathbones as a discretionary fund management 
provider to advisers had more than doubled in the last year,  
was a good outcome. Vision Independent Financial Planning 
made strong progress during the year, growing funds under 
management to £1.4 billion (2016: £1.0 billion) and continuing to 
attract quality advisers. In addition, our specialist intermediary 
team continues to focus on a number of important strategic 
partnerships, and is now well established. We expect flows to 
improve from the £265 million introduced in 2017 to around  
£350 million as the proposition continues to gain momentum.  
This year, we deliberately invested in establishing the right 
infrastructure to support our internal financial planning teams and 
further develop the proposition. We are now able to expand its 
footprint across more of our regional offices over the next year  
and expect to increase the number of professional staff in 2018.  
In total, we expect net costs to increase by up to £1.5 million as a 
result. The Rathbone Private Office became fully operational 
during 2017, with a marketing programme positioning the firm  
as a credible alternative for larg er and more complex clients, and 
raising its profile within the intermediary community.  
We remain mindful that current employee ownership in the 
business is culturally important and over recent years there has 
been a decline, primarily as a result of retirement. From 2018,  
we will seek to correct this by creating opportunities for more 
employees to build a larger el ement of equity ownership.  
Finally, investment markets inevitably present an element  
of cyclicality to earnings and stock performance and we will 
continue to monitor this as we review and update our goals for  
the next five years.

Regulation and infrastructure  
continue to evolve 
In 2017, we and the industry have had the task of implementing 
the significant regulatory changes that arise from the introduction 
of MiFID II and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 
particular. Whilst MiFID II has be en successfully delivered on time 
and work on GDPR is advanced, these new regimes will continue 
to require some significant chan ges to our core processes and 
systems, with costs continuing at similar levels into 2018.  
MiFID II, in particular, will have an impact on our Unit Trusts 
business, which will bear the full cost of external research in 2018. 
Research costs borne by the funds in 2017 were £0.8 million.  
This is in addition to the expect ed ban on ‘risk-free’ box dealing 
profits (2017: £3.1 million) foll owing the FCA’s Asset Management 
Market Study. We will look to offset these impacts in profit terms 
by continuing to grow the business and build on the momentum 
the team has achieved.  
Technology continues to be a significant entrant in our sector and 
I believe it will continue to play a disruptive role in the future if not 
wholly embraced. Whilst we are committed to our highly personal 
approach to providing investment and advisory services, we will 
continue to invest to capture the opportunities that these new 
technologies can offer to improv e our services and operational 
efficiency while increasing the capacity of our investment teams.  
In 2017, we reorganised and upgraded the skills of our IT team, 
which over the medium term will improve our data management 
capabilities, enhance our client communications and introduce 
additional security measures to combat the ever-growing  
cyber threat. We expect that this expansion of our IT capability, 
together with more general cost inflation, will add approximately 
£2.5 million to our running costs.  
Outlook 
This year has presented many challenges and opportunities and 
I fully expect 2018 to do so in equal measure. Brexit continues to 
be a regular discussion topic wi thin the investment community, 
but, as a predom inantly UK-based firm, our own view is largely 
focused on the wider economic environment and any impact it 
may have on the investments we make for our clients. 
I would like to take this opportunity to praise the efforts of our 
employees in this eventful last year. Notwithstanding the 
demands of our own change programme and a complicated 
market environment, they have ke pt the needs of our clients at 
the forefront of what we do and concentrated on providing an 
exemplary service.  
We enter 2018 in a good position, with industry-leading operating 
margins and a strong balance sheet. We will continue to look for 
accretive acquisition opportunities and to invest in our future  
with discipline.
