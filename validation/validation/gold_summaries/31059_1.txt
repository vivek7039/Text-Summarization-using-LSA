Introduction
I am delighted to present my c hief 
executive’s Review statement for 
Medica’s first year as a public 
company. 2017 has been a milestone 
year in the development of the 
Group with the successful listing on 
the Main Market of the l ondon 
stock exchange an important step 
in Medica’s development.
t he business has continued to 
develop throughout the year, 
improving services to clients, 
growing volumes and engaging with 
increasing numbers of radiologists 
whilst at the same time adapting to 
life as a public company.
I would like to thank the whole 
Medica team for their hard work  
and dedication this year and we are 
well positioned to take advantage of 
the many growth opportunities we 
see before us. o ur clinical, technical 
and operational excellence 
combined with financial strength 
and our new profile as a public 
company give Medica a great 
platform to develop its services in 
teleradiology and beyond.
Delivered robust volume growth
t his has been another strong year of 
double-digit growth for Medica with 
revenue increasing by 18.2% from 
last year. t he Group has successfully 
grown organically year-on-year 
through the continued successful 
deployment of new clients and by 
increasing the revenue generated 
from existing customers, which has 
been the main driver of revenue 
growth in the year.
s ignificantly volume growth was 
driven by both n ightHawk and 
Routine c ross-s ectional (cs ), 
computerised tomography (ct ) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
reporting which saw scan volumes 
increase by 31.1% and 23.8% 
respectively. Routine plain Film 
x-ray (pF) decreased by 5.9%.
t his growth in volume is being 
driven by several factors. t he overall 
market dynamics remain a key 
driver with the number of ct and 
MRI scans performed across the u K 
increasing year-on-year and 
continued shortages of radiologists 
to provide increasingly complex 
diagnostic reports. Medica, as the 
market leader in teleradiology, are 
leading the way to support the n Hs 
through the use of technology to 
bridge geographical and specialist 
gaps in resource and using its 
technical and clinical infrastructure 
to increase reporting productivity.
t he high quality of Medica’s clinical 
governance process has given 
clients more confidence in 
outsourcing. Increasingly n Hs 
t rusts are planning their activities 
around a deeper partnership with 
Medica and our services are more 
embedded within departments than 
ever before. Although the overall 
proportion of scans outsourced 
remains modest the proportion is 
growing as the market develops. 
Medica continues to attract new 
clients but the primary reason for 
growth is through additional 
reporting for existing customers.
Gross profit margin edged down 
from 49.8% to 48.7% as anticipated, 
reflecting the ongoing renewal of 
the Group’s contracts at marginally 
lower prices as the teleradiology 
market develops and outsourcing 
becomes normal practice. Increases 
in sales volume for our n Hs services 
more than offset the reduction in 
average price in 2017 from 
anticipated pricing pressures.
Recruitment
Recruitment remained a key focus 
during 2017 and we significantly 
increased the number of radiologists 
from 248 at the start of the year to 
306 at 31st december to meet 
growing market demand. Investment 
in recruitment, retention and training 
are priorities for the business as we 
seek to ensure radiologists are 
supported at all times, that the 
reporting experience is as smooth 
and efficient as possible and that 
radiologists can work in a high 
quality clinical environment.
Word of mouth recommendations 
from existing Medica radiologists 
who contract with the Group has 
become the most significant factor 
in bringing new radiologists into the 
recruitment process to be converted 
by our skilled recruitment team. In 
addition, the Group maintains a 
presence at many specialist and 
national events and maintains a 
database of candidates for 
recruitment. Medica’s recruitment 
pipeline remains stronger than ever.
Continued investment 
and development
during 2017 we have continued to 
invest in our clinical governance, 
technical and operational 
infrastructure and processes and we 
continue to raise the bar for the 
quality of teleradiology services in 
the u K.
t he clinical governance base is 
arguably the strongest element of 
Medica’s offering giving clients the 
confidence to outsource greater 
volumes and more complex work. 
Work in this area has continued 
apace in 2017 with particular 
emphasis on improving the quality 
of clinical internal audit and 
managing clinical issues. 18

As volumes grow it is important to 
continue to improve the operational 
processes so as to be able to deal 
with increasing volume whilst 
minimising cost increases. 
c onsiderable effort has gone into 
refining workflow management 
processes and as the proportion of 
more specialist exams increases, the 
balancing of capacity and demand 
in a timely manner is more 
important than ever.
t here has been considerable 
investment in Medica’s technical 
platform in recent years which 
continued in 2017. As the volume of 
scans and the number of clients and 
radiologists continued to grow the 
scalable platform has expanded but 
it has been important that Medica 
has continued to innovate and 
improve its systems and that 
information security has remained 
at the heart of all we do.
Strategy
t he directors have to date focused 
on building a platform that can 
deliver a high quality teleradiology 
service to the Group’s core 
customer base of n Hs hospitals, 
centred on its n ightHawk and 
Routine offerings.
t he Group’s strategy can be broadly 
categorised into three areas: 
developing the core business; 
accelerating the expansion into 
areas closely related to the core 
business; and broader 
diversification.
Developing the core business 
t he Group’s core strategy remains 
to develop and grow its business by 
adding additional Medica reporting 
capacity to meet growing demand, 
maintaining the highest clinical 
standards and continuing to win 
new work for its existing 
service lines.
Having invested in the Group’s It 
and services platform, both in terms 
of the technical and clinical aspects 
and the ongoing recruitment of 
Medica radiologists, the directors 
believe that the business can 
continue to grow strongly within its 
existing service lines. continual 
development of the current core 
services, improving the offering to 
clients and the radiologist 
experience as well as improving the 
efficiency of Medica’s internal 
infrastructure are a key part of 
Medica’s strategy.
Medica will continue to improve the 
workflow for clients and radiologists 
and a good example is the 
forthcoming launch of a new 
n ightHawk portal and process. t his 
will bring considerable advances for 
both clients and our radiologists 
and enable improved efficiency and 
performance in the specialist 
emergency services Medica can 
offer.
Increasing specialisation of 
radiologists and demand from 
clients will evolve the Routine cs 
service line and using Medica’s 
substantial and growing pool of 
specialist radiologists, Medica can 
offer national cover to the n Hs for 
specialist reporting services.
Radiographer reporting is a key 
growth area for the core business. 
l aunched in August 2016 this 
service has been grown in a steady 
and controlled way and advanced 
practitioner radiographers represent 
an increasing part of Medica’s 
routine pF capacity, representing 
14% of the total pF exams in 2017. 
u nderpinned by strong clinical 
governance growing this service can 
play an important role in the n Hs 
managing their waiting times and 
minimising backlogs.
t here are also further opportunities 
in the independent sector and 
internationally that can expand 
Medica’s core business.
Accelerating expansion into 
related areas
Medica has developed specialist 
reporting lines including virtual 
colonoscopy and dual energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (dXA) o steoporosis 
scanning. t he service lines have 
been developed with specialists but 
currently form a small part of 
Medica’s business and the next 
stage is to increase the number of 
clients using these services.
Most recently we have developed a 
c ardiac reporting service, which has 
launched in the first quarter of 2018 
and there are other specialist 
services currently under 
development. After an initial piloting 
stage these services can be 
expanded to new and existing 
clients.
t he Group has a strong clinical 
governance structure, including an 
internal clinical audit function 
focused on maintaining the high 
clinical and service standards of 
Medica radiologists. Having been 
approached by our customers and 
others to audit their own in-house 
radiology departments, there is a 
clear opportunity to market this 
service to existing and new clients. 
Medica has developed bespoke 
software in 2017 to facilitate this 
service with a view to growing 
demand in 2018.
Broader Opportunities
t he directors believe that there are 
a number of wider tele-health and 
broader healthcare opportunities 
that the Group would be well-placed 
to take advantage of.

t hese are considered longer-term 
opportunities and would likely 
require investment in additional 
expertise to augment that already in 
place and, in some circumstances, 
may be better achieved through 
acquisition. t he Board intends to 
develop plans for some of these 
opportunities in coming periods.
Outlook
l ooking forward to 2018, the year 
has started well, with trading in line 
with the Board’s expectations. t he 
prospects for new work from 
existing and new clients and the 
pipeline for recruiting radiologists in 
the new financial year continues to 
be strong which gives me 
confidence in our outlook for 2018.
As the market evolves the Board is 
confident that, in the short to 
medium term, Medica will continue 
to grow revenues at a double-digit 
rate similar to that seen in 2017.
