 Creating quality outcomes
for our employees, customers and for patients
Chief Executive’s Statement
I am pleased to report another strong set of results across the 
Group. Our revenue has increased 16% to £96.9 million and we have 
improved our adjusted
2
 profit before tax by 29% to £25.4 million 
and our reported profit before tax by 32% to £25.3 million 
(2016: £19.1 million).
Our strategy for growth remains unchanged. We continue to expand 
into new geographies, increase our distribution of surgical products 
through our direct sales forces, and enhance our product portfolio 
by developing high quality products that add value to patients and 
payors in our advanced woundcare and surgical markets.
As reported at the half year, we have streamlined our reporting 
structure and now operate under two Business Units: Branded 
and OEM.
Branded 
The Branded Business Unit reports the sales of all our own brands. 
Branded reported revenue was 22% higher at £55.2 million 
(2016: £45.4 million) and 16% higher at constant currency. 
LiquiBand
®
 topical adhesives 
LiquiBand
®
 is our range of medical adhesives based on 
cyanoacrylate, and is our largest brand with sales of £26.0 million, 
(2016: £19.3 million) up 35% on the prior year and 30% at 
constant currency. 
Our LiquiBand
®
 range of products utilises different formulations of 
cyanoacrylate in innovatively designed applicators. They are designed 
to meet the requirements of the clinician and to treat the full 
spectrum of wounds that they need to close and protect. They have 
several key attributes that compare favourably with the existing 
market leader, including wound closure strength, tensile strength, set 
time, surface area coverage and adhesive yield.
Sales in the US, which remains our largest market, increased by 47% 
to £18.2 million (2016: £12.4 million) at reported currency and by 
40% at constant currency. We access this market through distributors 
who target both hospitals and non hospitals, helping us to identify 
customers and convert opportunities into sales following surgeon 
evaluation. We support our partners with marketing and clinical data 
demonstrating the efficacy of our products. We continue to grow our 
volume market share which is now at 26%, up 2% from June 2017 
and 3% over the full year.

In the UK and Germany good progress has been made. 
Revenues have increased 12% to £5.3 million (2016: £4.7 million) 
and 10% at constant currency with new hospitals being accessed. 
In the EU and ROW, sales of LiquiBand
®
 increased by 19% to 
£2.5 million (2016: £2.1 million) at reported currency and 18% at 
constant currency. 
We are now targeting new geographic markets for LiquiBand
®
. 
Following on from establishing distribution agents in Asia, we have 
also identified opportunities for LiquiBand
®
 in a number of Central 
American markets and anticipate first sales in this region in 2018. 
Our primary focus for R&D is to extend our LiquiBand
®
 product range 
to compete in the growing market for combined glues and tape used 
for larger wound closure. We expect to receive approval to market 
this in the US around the end of 2018. 
Hernia Mesh Fixation device – LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™
LiquiBand
®
 Fix 8™ is used to hold hernia meshes in place within 
the body instead of tacks and staples. This accurate laparoscopic 
application of adhesive is expected to both reduce surgical 
complications and reduce the potential pain associated with the use 
of tacks and staples. It also provides the ability to attach mesh in areas 
where tacks and staples cannot be applied, helping to improve the 
patient experience and surgical outcomes.
As reported at the half year, sales growth of LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™ 
has been restricted due to design enhancements we have made 
following surgeon feedback. Further feedback has been received 
on the updated device and modifications have been completed. 
We have chosen not to actively promote the device while the 
modifications were ongoing, nevertheless sales increased by 3% 
to £1.7 million (2016: £1.7 million) and 1% at constant currency. 
We expect to see a return to sales growth this year.
At present, the device is approved for use within Europe and those 
markets that accept European approval standards. We have started 
the process to get LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™ approved in the US market. 
This necessitates a full Pre Market Approval (PMA) involving clinical 
trials with patient enrolment expected to start in mid 2018 and 
enrolment completing by the end of the year. We expect the total 
cost of completing the approval process will be around £3 million 
with the majority of the spend being incurred in 2018 and 2019. 
In R&D, we are also working on broadening the claims on the use of 
the device for hernia mesh fixation as well as for a number of other 
laparoscopic surgical applications and developing a device suitable 
for hernia mesh fixation in open surgery which we expect to launch 
in Europe in the first half of 2019. 
RESORBA
®
Our RESORBA
®
 branded products portfolio is comprised of a 
comprehensive range of sutures which are used to close wounds 
and a range of bio-surgical products that include collagens, cellulose 
and bone substitutes that can be used as haemostats or scaffolds 
for tissue growth. Sales of RESORBA
®
 products increased by 15% to 
£20.8 million (2016: £18.1 million) and by 6% at constant currency. 
Within this, sales of sutures increased by 15% to £13.0 million 
(2016: £11.3 million) and by 6% at constant currency and sales of  
bio-surgical products increased by 16% to £7.9 million 
(2016: £6.8 million) and by 8% at constant currency. 
During 2016, we renegotiated the supply agreement with an OEM 
partner for collagen products in order to go direct. We are pleased 
that we have started to sell these products into a number of 
new territories. 
Germany remains our largest market with £13.0 million of sales 
(2016: £12.0 million), up 8% on the prior year and up by 1% at 
constant currency while sales to markets outside Germany 
accessed by our distributors increased by 30% to £7.5 million 
(2016: £5.8 million) and 19% at constant currency. Our initiative to 
offer a range of dental sutures into the US market is developing 
and following launch in 2016, sales have increased to £0.3 million. 
The total US surgical suture market is estimated to be in excess of 
$1 billion and is dominated by a few major brands and provides a 
significant opportunity for the Group in the medium term.
We continue to access new markets, in particular Asia Pacific, and 
have recently hired a new sales manager to target Australasia for both 
our RESORBA
®
 and LiquiBand
®
 brand ranges. 
In R&D we continue to work on preparing a range of different 
antibiotics that can be incorporated in our bio-surgical products. 
We expect to file for European approval in the second half of 2018.
ActivHeal
®
ActivHeal
®
 is our range of high quality woundcare dressings 
specifically designed to offer the NHS significant cost savings 
without compromising on clinical outcomes or patient care. Sales of 
ActivHeal
®
 increased by 4% to £6.3 million (2015: £6.0 million), 
reversing the decline that was reported in 2016, however the market 
remains difficult with increasing price pressure becoming evident. 
The Group has enhanced its education and marketing materials 
as well as broadened its product range with our antimicrobial and 
atraumatic foam dressing ranges. 
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017 06 OEM
Our OEM business supports our partners with a multi-product 
portfolio of advanced woundcare products and bulk materials. 
We have been working with many of the world’s major wound care 
companies for a number of years providing manufacturing services to 
supply their woundcare dressings, new products they can incorporate 
into their portfolio of brands, as well as regulatory assistance in 
obtaining product approvals in overseas markets. Revenue increased 
10% to £41.7 million (2016: £37.8 million) and increased 8% at 
constant currency. 
A key driver for this Business Unit is in supplying products that 
incorporate antimicrobials. Sales of our antimicrobial dressings 
increased by 11% to £19.4 million (2016: £17.5 million), and by 9% at 
constant currency. Within this, silver alginate products grew by 12% 
to £18.0 million (2016: £16.2 million) and by 9% at constant currency 
while the Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB) foam range, which 
was launched in 2016 into Europe, increased 2% at reported and 
constant currency. 
PHMB is an antimicrobial which is effective against several bacteria 
including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 
Escherichia coli (E.coli). Although we received approval to market 
PHMB foam into the US in 2017, we deferred a launch until we could 
market these products with extended claims. We expect to obtain 
these approvals in 2018.
Sales of our non-antimicrobial foams were down 16% at reported 
currency to £7.4 million (2016: £8.8 million) and by 20% at constant 
currency. Sales were impacted by the pipeline fill of our atraumatic 
foam launches in 2016, which we estimate to have been around 
£1 million. We also had some issues caused by a change of raw 
material from one of our suppliers which interrupted our ability to 
promote part of our more established range of products. These issues 
are now resolved. Sales of our other technologies, which include 
alginates and gels, increased 7% at reported currency to £11.8 million 
(2016: £11.0 million) and by 5% at constant currency.
In October 2017 we agreed an out-licensing agreement with 
Organogenesis Inc., a commercial leader in regenerative medicine 
focused on advanced woundcare and surgical biologics, on a U.S. 
patent for a collagen-based wound dressing containing PHMB.
Under the terms of the agreement, Organogenesis has been granted 
an exclusive license in the United States to the patent. In exchange 
for this, we have recognised £2.5 million from royalties, and will 
receive a minimum royalty of $1 million for each of the financial 
years ending 31 December 2018 and 2019. This is part of an ongoing 
royalty stream that will be payable to AMS on the net sales of the 
Licensed Product for the life of the patent. The patent is due to expire 
in October 2026.
The Group’s ability to out-license our patented technologies is an 
endorsement of the quality of our innovation and we are pleased to 
be working with a partner that is using the AMS patent to access the 
US market so effectively. 
In the latter part of 2017, we noted that a number of our partners have 
reported a slowdown in the European advanced woundcare market. 
We continue, however, to believe in our medium and long term 
prospects in this market.
In R&D, we continue to work on extending our advanced woundcare 
portfolio with focus on our antimicrobial range, improving the 
absorbancy of dressings and combining a number of materials to 
enhance product performance. We are developing a range of surgical 
dressings for which we are expecting to obtain approval in mid 2018 
for the US market. We are also expecting to receive approval to 
market an antimicrobial high performance dressing in the US before 
the end of 2018.

Operations and regulatory
With the business continuing to show strong organic growth, we 
have made investments in our converting capability at our Etten Leur 
site, as well as improving our packaging capability in Nuremberg 
which is expected to complete in 2018. 
As a result of the continued success of our medical adhesives 
business, we have also made plans to extend the capacity of the 
Plymouth facility. This will be a significant project for us and we 
estimate that the spend will be around £4 million and will take 
around three years. It will provide us with the capability to increase 
production of our existing product range as well as allowing us 
the capacity to manufacture new products such as the open 
hernia device. 
Following the FDA inspection of our Winsford site in June 2016, 
our Plymouth facility was inspected by the FDA in April 2017. 
We were very pleased with the outcome of this audit with no non-
conformances raised. 
The new European Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) entered into 
force on 25 May 2017, marking the start of the transition period 
for manufacturers selling medical devices into Europe. The MDR, 
which replaces the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) has a transition 
period of three years and manufacturers have this transition period 
to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the 
new requirements. The MDR brings more scrutiny on product safety 
and performance and stricter requirements on clinical evaluation 
and post-market clinical follow up. Our notified body, BSI, is already 
adopting the new standard and we are working with our OEM 
partners to ensure that we meet the new requirements. We anticipate 
that, although there will be some additional costs associated with 
meeting the new requirements, overall, the tighter regulatory 
standards should prove beneficial for the Group in the longer term.
Our implementation of Oracle ERP in Germany was successfully 
completed at the end of September. This will bring benefits 
from better availability of information and enhanced controls. 
This completes our major ERP conversions across the Group, 
although ongoing improvements to systems will continue. 
Acquisitions strategy
The Group is actively looking for businesses that meet its acquisition 
strategy of:
 e licensing or acquiring technology that allows us to leverage our 
global OEM customer base or branded routes to market;
 e licensing or acquiring additional brands within woundcare, wound 
closure or surgical setting that complement our existing range; and
 e geographic expansion through acquiring surgically focused 
companies with strong direct sales capability and ownership of 
complementary products.
We have an internal team working with advisors to identify, appraise 
and progress acquisition opportunities. 
The UK and the European Union 
To date, there has been no day-to-day operational impact of the 
referendum vote to leave the European Union, other than changes 
to currency exchange rates. In preparation, the Group has submitted 
its application to obtain Authorised Economic Operator status for its 
UK trading entities and expects to achieve this designation by the end 
of the year. With its footprint in mainland Europe, the Group is well 
positioned to deal with the uncertain outcome of the UK negotiations 
with the EU, moving activities into jurisdictions that are beneficial to 
the business.
Our culture
As a Group that is highly dependent on the innovation and creativity 
of our employees for our future growth and success, it is important 
that we have a culture and set of values that is understood and 
embraced across the business. We have adopted the business motto 
of ‘The AMS Care, Fair, Dare approach’ to summarise our culture, 
underpin our values, and to deliver results, building a sustainable 
future for our business. Under this motto, we have defined the 
principles and expectations of how we will operate together to 
deliver success. We have run workshops across all our sites and have 
responded to feedback about how we can improve the Care, Fair, 
Dare ethos in the workplace. We are now embodying these attitudes 
into our objectives and appraisal process. 
We recognise the importance of our people to the Group and that 
it is only by their effective engagement that we will continue to be 
successful. We value their commitment and determination to achieve 
and deliver good results. Our working environment encourages 
openness, teamwork, an understanding of others’ needs and the 
ability ‘to make a difference’. We continue to develop the talent 
at AMS by training and by providing a place to work where our 
employees feel valued, incentivised and fulfilled.
Summary and outlook
2017 has seen another good performance by the Group. T rading in 
the current financial year has begun well and is in line with the 
Board’s expectations. With our increasing portfolio of products, 
high quality business partners, the opportunities we see from our 
R&D pipeline and our strong financial position, the Board remains 
optimistic about our long-term prospects and the potential for 
further growth.
