 Financial performance showed progress with 
a return to organic growth. 2018 will continue 
to reflect the focus on strategic delivery underpinned 
by a focus on safety performance.

2017 was the second year of the three-year plan 
to reinvigorate the Company through investment 
in products, people and better operational 
processes. It was pleasing to see that financial 
performance showed some modest progress, 
particularly as the global economy started to 
show some signs of growth in the latter part of 
the year. On an organic constant-currency basis*, 
revenues increased by 1.4%, and the balance 
sheet was stronger at the end of the year due to 
better operational management and disposals 
with net debt* reducing to £181.3 million from 
£242.5 million in 2016. Despite disposals of 
mature assets with good margins the operating 
profit margin was stable with the negative effects 
of those disposals offset by operating efficiencies 
and higher revenues. The proposed dividend is 
unchanged at 1 1.0p per share.
The next year will see further progress in the 
important areas of achieving greater effectiveness 
in winning new business through training and 
key new hires, improving Leadership behaviours, 
and making the support functions as efficient 
as possible. Together with the reinvestment 
in our Centres of Excellence the Board believes 
the Group has the capability to generate organic 
growth in the future by concentrating on areas 
of the markets with needs particularly attuned 
to our capabilities.
In addition to growing the business, the right 
behaviours must be observed and all employees 
should be sure of operating in a safe environment. 
It was very disappointing to see a road accident 
in the USA which injured 19 of our employees, 
some of them seriously. Aside from this the 
accident rates in some of our other businesses 
did not improve. Performance objectives of 
top management continue to place emphasis 
on causing positive change in this area.
There has been a further change in the Board 
during the year with Rob Rowley stepping down 
as Non-executive Director and Chairman of 
the Audit Committee. I am very grateful for Rob’s 
interest in, and support for the Company during 
his tenure. I therefore welcome Jane Aikman to 
the Board as a Non-executive Director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. Jane is a 
highly experienced plc Finance Director from 
various businesses, and was Chairman of the 
Audit Committee of Halma plc from 2009 to 
2016.
