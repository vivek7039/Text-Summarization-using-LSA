CHAIRMAN’S  
STATEMENT
2017 was a transformational year for Animalcare 
Group plc. Whilst characterised by continued 
organic growth, the most dominant factor during 
the year was the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar 
NV (“Ecuphar”). The transaction completed 
on 13
th
 July 2017 and our statutory results for 
the year ended December 2017 reflect a full 
12 months contribution from Ecuphar and five 
and a half months of Animalcare Group plc 
(“Animalcare”), as previously constituted. 2016 
comparatives are only for the Ecuphar business. 
Financial Trading
Group revenue increased by 22.4% to £83.7m 
(2016: £68.4m) with 11.3% organic growth 
within the Ecuphar business which contributed 
£76.1m to overall Group revenues and 
£7.6m from the original Animalcare business. 
Underlying EBITDA (which excludes fair value 
adjustments on acquired inventory, amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and acquisition and 
integration costs) increased by 11.9% to £10.0m 
(2016: £8.9m) with £1.6m contributed by the 
Animalcare business. This performance primarily 
reflects the impact of lower gross margins, 
investments to support future growth and the 
disposal of Nutriscience which Ecuphar sold in 
October 2016. Including non-underlying items, 
the Group’s profit before tax decreased to £0.5m 
(2016: £5.1m). The Group generated £2.6m 
(2016: £9.3m) net cash from operations which 
included a cash outflow from non-underlying 
items totalling £3.8m. 
Further details on business performance 
can be found in the CEO Review and CFO 
Review respectively.
Board
Following the acquisition, the executive Directors 
comprised Chris Cardon, who took on the role of 
Chief Executive Officer for the enlarged group, 
supported by Iain Menneer as Chief Operating 
Officer and Walter Beyers as Chief Financial 
Officer. In September 2017 Chris Brewster, who 
at the time of the acquisition stood down as a 
Board Director but remained within the business, 
was reappointed to the Board as Chief Financial 
Officer, replacing Walter Beyers who resigned  
to pursue other interests. More recently Iain 
Menneer stood down as Chief Operating Officer. 
I would like to take the opportunity to recognise 
both Iain’s and Walter’s contributions and we 
wish them well for the future. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.0 
pence per share, which when added to the 
second interim dividend of 4.7 pence per shares 
gives a total dividend of 6.7 pence per share 
since the reverse acquisition. This final dividend 
is subject to shareholder approval at the  
Annual General Meeting on 27th June 2018  
and will be paid on 6th July 2018 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on  
8th June 2018.
Product Development
A key strategy for growth remains the continued 
cultivation of a strong new product development 
pipeline. In 2017 we launched Acecare, a 
sedative, from Animalcare’s original UK pipeline 
and sales have performed in line with internal 
forecasts. We have deliberately focused the 
development team on 17 active projects and we 
have a steady flow of products that are going 
through registration and are expected to launch 
in 2018 and 2019. 
Summary and Outlook
Having brought together two highly 
complementary businesses, in particular with 
regard to our respective geographic markets, 
product portfolios and product development 
pipelines, we are growing a successful pan-
European animal health business. We have the 
opportunity to continue this growth through 
further strategic acquisitions, but also through 
organic growth focused on existing products 
and our product development pipeline, as well 
as the synergies and benefits of cross-selling 
which we expect to see impacting our Q4 2018 
performance and more meaningfully in 2019. 
We believe we have created a platform for strong 
future growth and I look forward to updating on 
our progress.
