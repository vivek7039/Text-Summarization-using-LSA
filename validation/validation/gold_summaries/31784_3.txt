Chairman’s statement
“This performance would not 
be possible without the ongoing 
commitment and hard work 
of our employees across our 
stores, distribution centres 
and head offices.” 
 
 Henry Staunton
 Chairman
It is with great pleasure in this, our 225th 
anniversary year , that I report another year of 
strong performance to 31 August 2017. We have 
seen a good sales performance across our Travel 
businesses both in the UK and internationally , 
driven by our key initiatives and growth in passenger 
numbers, some strong performances from recently 
opened stores in international locations; and a High 
Street performance equal to the particularly strong 
result from last year . 
The distinct strategies of our Travel and High Street 
businesses continue to be successful in driving 
profit and creating shareholder value. The Group has 
grown its profit again with Group profit before tax 
increasing by seven per cent to £140m. 
The Group remains highly cash generative delivering 
a free cash flow¹ of £105m. 
We remain focused on profitable growth, cash 
generation and creating value for shareholders, 
while investing for future growth.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance remains an important area of focus for 
the Board and underpins the sustainability of our business and 
the achievement of our strategy. A more detailed explanation 
of our approach to corporate governance can be found in our 
Corporate governance report on pages 30 to 56.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
During the year , we have continued our focus on managing those 
social and environmental issues which are most material to our 
business and to our stakeholders. Our workstreams cover a 
wide range of issues from ethical trade and sustainable forestry 
to mental health awareness and diversity. In this, our 225th 
anniversary year , we wanted to make a lasting difference to 
charities which our employees care about. Our teams across the 
business have been undertaking a number of activities as they 
work together to reach our £2m fundraising target. It has been a 
fantastic year so far , bringing the business together in a shared 
objective, and we hope that our three charity partners, Cancer 
Research UK, Mind and the National Literacy Trust, will see 
the benefits for many years to come. Further information on all 
aspects of our CR programmes can be found on pages 25 to 27.
PEOPLE
This performance would not be possible without the ongoing 
commitment and hard work of our employees across our stores, 
distribution centres and head offices. I would like to thank each 
and every individual for their ongoing support. 
OUTLOOK
While the economic environment remains uncertain, we believe 
we are well positioned for the year ahead and we remain focused 
on the distinct strategies of each of our businesses in order 
to maximise the contribution from both and best deliver value 
for shareholders.
