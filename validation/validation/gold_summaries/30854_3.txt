DRIVING VALUE 
CREATION
Chairman’s statement
growing customer programmes and build 
further capacity for growth.
Our second priority is to grow our ordinary 
dividend in line with earnings through the 
cycle. Over the past five years we have 
grown our dividend by 6.1% p.a, during a 
period of significant reinvestment. During 
this period, we have delivered free cash 
flow of more than 140% of our dividend, 
demonstrating the cash generative nature 
of our business model.
Reflecting the continued confident 
outlook for the medium term, the Board 
is proposing a 5% increase to the full year 
dividend to 15.85p per share for 2017  
(2016: 15.10p per share).
With products installed on over 69,000 civil 
and military aircraft, increased content on 
new aircraft and consistent growth in air 
travel, Meggitt is well positioned for growth 
over the medium to long term.
Having passed the peak of investment 
in research and development, the focus 
of the business is now on building the 
capability and capacity to deliver these new 
programmes to our customers and driving 
operational efficiencies that will enhance 
our competitiveness and accelerate growth 
in shareholder returns.
Capital Allocation
To deliver this sustainable growth in 
shareholder returns over the medium to 
long term, the Board has outlined a series of 
priorities for capital allocation. 
Our first priority is investing in the organic 
growth and operational efficiency of the 
business. In 2017, we have continued to 
make significant investments to develop 
new technologies, fund our participation in 
In last year’s report I talked about the significant increases in 
content Meggitt had secured on new generation aircraft 
during a period of unprecedented product renewal by the 
major airframe and engine manufacturers. As we mostly 
supply products as a sole source provider, we are the only 
provider of spare parts on these platforms that will be in 
operation for decades to come.

Our third priority is to target value accretive 
acquisitions in attractive markets where we 
have or can develop a strong competitive 
position. The Board meets regularly to review 
the Group’s strategy and has a clear view 
on the areas of capability we should grow by 
acquisition. This list is refined on an annual 
basis and potential targets are assessed 
against a rigorous set of criteria including 
both financial metrics and more qualitative 
assessments, including cultural fit.
Finally, in the absence of any compelling 
investment opportunities for a prolonged 
period, our fourth priority is to maintain 
an efficient balance sheet in line with the 
Board’s guideline range of 1.5x to 2.5x Net 
debt:EBITDA

, designed to ensure clear 
headroom against our covenants. 
Board Changes
In November, we announced that Stephen 
Young would step down from the Board 
and his role as Chief Executive in December 
2017 before retiring in April 2018. Stephen 
has served as our Chief Executive for  
five years and prior to that, for nine years as 
Finance Director. During this 14 year period, 
Group revenue grew fivefold, profitability 
increased by nearly 460% and total 
shareholder returns grew by 420%. We 
thank Stephen for the significant role he has 
played in the development of the Group and 
we wish him well in his retirement.
Stephen has been succeeded by Tony Wood 
who joined Meggitt in December 2016 as 
Chief Operating Officer. With over 30 years of 
experience in senior aerospace roles, both at 
Rolls-Royce and Safran, Tony brings a wealth 
of industry knowledge, skills and extensive 
operational experience that will make him 
an excellent successor. Further details on 
the process to appoint Tony is included in 
the Nominations Committee report on page 
69. As reported last year, Nancy Gioia joined 
the Board in April 2017, replacing Brenda 
Reichelderfer who retired after serving six 
years as a Non-Executive Director.
People
I was pleased to be able to visit a number 
of our sites in 2017 and I continue to be 
impressed by the skills and commitment our 
employees demonstrate. This, combined 
with our specialist capabilities and leading 
positions in our core markets, is at the centre 
of everything we do. I would like to thank all of 
our employees for their hard work this year. 
In 2018, I will ensure the Board continues 
to focus on culture, inclusion, diversity 
and employee engagement, in support of 
executive management’s ambition for Meggitt 
to be an employer of choice.
