How it has changed  
during the period
Oil price fluctuations
  
Oil prices can be volatile and subject to fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in 
the supply of, and demand for, oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that 
are beyond the control of the Group such as the impact of a greater market shift to renewable 
energy sources. It is impossible to predict accurately future oil price movements. Accordingly, 
oil prices may not remain at their current levels. Declines in oil prices may adversely affect the 
cashflows generated from the EPS and may also affect market sentiment and consequently, the 
market price of the Company’s ordinary shares and the ability of the Group to raise finance.
The viability of the Group’s assets is assessed on a regular basis. Economic models of development cases are stress tested 
using varying oil price forecasts. Investments have and will only be made if development cases are robust to downside 
price sensitivity scenarios. For Hurricane’s producing assets the Group will consider the use of oil price hedging to manage 
any potential exposure.
Third party infrastructure
Any field development, including gas export, is likely to be dependent upon the availability of 
third party infrastructure. If this fails, or is not available on reasonable commercial terms, it may 
result in delays to field development, production and cash generation. This would have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, financial condition and operations.
In planning the development scenarios for the Group’s assets, the use of third party infrastructure is assessed. 
Consideration is given to the extent, nature and commercial arrangements of potential use of third party infrastructure. 
The Group minimises the use of third party infrastructure where appropriate. Where third party infrastructure is used the 
Group seeks to align the third party with the Group’s success on the project via its commercial agreements. 
Development project delivery
  
Development projects are subject to various risks including availability of third party services and 
manufacturing slots, solvency of major contractors, correct fabrication of key components to 
specification, incident-free installation operations, installation windows, permits, consents and 
weather. Problems with any of the above can cause project delays that would impact both the 
timing for completion of the project, as well as the cost. This can have a material impact on the 
projected cashflow from the project and the funding required. Delays to target first oil or cost 
overruns in the case of the EPS could have a particularly significant impact on the Group given 
that it currently has no alternative source of revenue.
As the Group gets closer to first oil on the EPS, the importance of successful development 
delivery has increased.
The Group invests significant time and resources to plan its development projects and focuses on minimising the various 
development risks. The Group uses a range of third party service providers and experts to co-ordinate, plan and deliver 
development projects. Contingency is built into all project plans to allow for unexpected delays and cost overruns. A large 
portion of capital expenditure for the EPS was fixed under lump sum contracts which has reduced the Group’s exposure 
to cost overruns. 
Health, Safety and 
Environmental (HSE)
In performing offshore exploration, development or production activities and onshore 
fabrication activities there is a risk of harm to the workforce, to the environment (e.g. from 
fabrication processes, hydrocarbon releases and/or oil spills, damage to seabed ecosystems 
or disturbance to marine mammal populations from noise pollution), to the assets during 
construction or in use, and to the Company’s reputation as a result of some or all of the above.
The Group adopts its procedures in relation to HSE to assess, manage and control the risk faced by the workforce and 
mitigate against accidental damage to the environment and its assets and in doing so seeks to protect its reputation. 
HSE risks are minimised by the Group’s corporate processes which ensure the employment of competent individuals, the 
procurement of appropriate equipment and the selection and monitoring of operational activities. In addition, the Group 
uses external consultants and specialists to plan and prepare for various emergency scenarios, including but not limited 
to oil spills. As part of its preparedness, the Group undertakes training and exercises to assess the effectiveness of its 
procedures, processes and specialist service providers. The Group also carries various insurances.
Compliance
There is a risk of a major breach of the Group’s business or ethical conduct standards due to 
unethical behaviour or breaches of anti-corruption laws, resulting in investigations, fines, loss of 
reputation and loss of assets. 
Top-down leadership of the Group’s values supported by Group-wide corporate compliance training, including 
implementation of the Group’s anti-corruption and bribery procedures across the Group’s organisation and  
contracting arrangements.

Financial Statements
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in this Strategic Report. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows and liquidity position are described 
in the Financial Review. Further details of 
the Group’s commitments are set out in 
notes 25 and 26 of the Group Financial 
Statements. In addition, note 24 to the 
Group Financial Statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments; and its exposures  
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has no source of operating 
revenue prior to first oil from the EPS 
(currently anticipated to occur in H1 2019) 
and currently obtains working capital 
primarily through equity and debt financing. 
During the year, the Group raised gross 
funds of $547 million (before expenses), 
split between $317 million from the issue of 
ordinary shares in the Company of £0.001 
each (Ordinary Shares) and $230 million 
from the issue of Convertible Bonds. 
The directors have performed a robust 
assessment, including a review of the budget 
for the year ending December 2019 and 
longer-term strategic forecasts and plans, 
including consideration of the Principal 
Risks faced by the Company, as detailed on 
pages 18 to 21. In particular, the directors 
considered a number of scenarios which 
included the impact of a delay in first oil 
from the EPS, cost and schedule overruns 
during the installation period and, following 
first oil, downside sensitivities in relation 
to production rates, operational uptime, 
oil price, opex and foreign exchange rates. 
Following this review, the directors are 
satisfied that, taking into consideration 
reasonably foreseeable downside 
sensitivities, the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue to 
operate and meet their liabilities as they 
fall due for the foreseeable future, a period 
considered to be at least twelve months 
from the date of signing these Financial 
Statements. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the Going Concern Basis for 
preparing the Financial Statements.
Principal Risks, Going Concern  
and Long-Term Viability Statement continued
Long-term viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2. of the Code, the Board confirms that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the three-year period ended 31 December 2020 (the Lookout Period).
The  Lookout Period: 
The directors have determined that the 
appropriate period to assess the long-term 
viability of the business is three years. 
This period incorporates the engineering, 
procurement, construction, installation and 
commissioning of the EPS and between 
approximately 18 months and two 
subsequent years of production. At the 
end of the second year of production the 
Company has to elect whether to extend its 
contract on the Aoka Mizu; a decision which 
will be informed by the first two years of 
production. During the three-year period over 
which the directors have reviewed the long-
term viability of the business there are two 
distinct phases.
•  Phase 1 includes the period to first oil. 
The risks and analysis for this period are 
included within the going concern analysis 
outlined above. 
•  Phase 2 is a period of two years of 
production until the directors must 
decide whether to extend the contract 
on the Aoka Mizu. During this phase the 
Company will also seek to undertake 
further development, exploration and 
appraisal activity from its own cash-flow 
and, potentially, from farminees across its 
Rona Ridge licences.
• During Phase 1, the directors principally 
reviewed the development project 
delivery risk for the EPS.
•  During Phase 2, the directors reviewed 
each of the principal risks related to 
the EPS, with particular reference to 
geological and reservoir risk, production 
operational performance risk and oil price 
fluctuations risk.
 A n a l y s i s P e r fo r m e d: 
Whilst each of the risks outlined on 
pages 18 to 21 has a potential impact 
on the business, in Phase 2 the directors 
focussed on geological and reservoir risk, 
production operational performance risks, 
and the impact of oil price on the business, 
by running sensitivities including lower 
production rates and different oil price 
scenarios. The risks have been assessed 
for their potential impact on the Group’s 
business model, future trading and funding 
structure. The range of downside scenarios 
tested was carefully considered by the 
directors, factoring in the potential impact, 
probability of occurrence and effectiveness 
of the mitigating actions, where appropriate. 
A combined sensitivity containing an 
aggregation of all scenarios considered was 
performed and, whilst considered unlikely 
to occur, it demonstrated the Group’s 
ability to take mitigating actions, within 
management’s control, to maintain liquidity.
•  The review was conducted with 
sensitivities including a scenario delivering 
production in line with the 1P production 
case in the Lancaster CPR.
• The review assumed that further 
development, exploration and appraisal 
activity would only be undertaken 
if fully-funded and therefore such 
incremental activity was not included 
in either scenario planning or sensitivity 
analysis. The Group’s ability to develop its 
assets beyond the EPS is dependent on 
performance of the EPS being sufficient 
to provide cash flow that is surplus to the 
Group’s other requirements, or on future 
fundraising activity.
 
Risks explicitly considered 
in the LTV analysis are 
highlighted on the Principal 
Risks table on pages 18 to 21.

Year Ended 31 December 2017
Overview
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
The Lincoln well was completed at the end 
of 2016, with results being analysed as the 
rig relocated to Halifax to drill the fourth and 
final well in a campaign that lasted 265 days. 
In parallel, the development and operations 
teams were focused on delivering the EPS. 
Transitioning this project from a planning and 
contracting phase, to project execution is a 
landmark achievement for Hurricane. At the 
same time, the Company’s organisation was 
supplemented by a number of new positions 
as we move from being an exploration 
and appraisal (E&A) company to being an 
exploration and production (E&P) company.
The achievements below represent some 
of the highlights for the year. Of particular 
importance from Hurricane’s perspective, 
is that these were achieved with no major 
HSE incidents, despite expending more 
than half a million man-hours between 
Hurricane and its primary contractors both 
on and offshore.
Review of Operations 
The year in review commenced with 
both offshore drilling operations, West of 
Shetland, and front-end engineering and 
design (FEED) studies for the EPS ongoing.
Subsurface
Lincoln well
Hurricane’s exploration model was that 
Lincoln represented a similar reservoir 
to Lancaster and would contain a 
hydrocarbon column height of at least 
455m, based on the ODT from offset well 
data. To evaluate Lincoln’s potential, an 
exploration well was planned to drill to 
a depth of 2,135m true vertical depth 
subsea (TVDSS) and detect the presence 
of hydrocarbons through a detailed 
mudlogging and wireline programme. 
The well was drilled to the target depth of 
2,135m TVDSS. On evaluating the available 
data, it was concluded that the wellbore 
had not encountered a water leg and so 
the well was deepened to 2,325m TVDSS. 
Drilling was terminated before an oil 
water contact had been identified due to 
time constraints and the requirement to 
undertake Halifax operations.
A hydrocarbon column has been detected 
in the range of 2,109 to 2,325m TVDSS, 
indicating a minimum hydrocarbon column 
height of between 444m and 660m TVT. 
The depth of the penetrated hydrocarbon 
column is indicative that Lancaster and 
Lincoln are not in pressure communication 
and therefore the two assets exist as 
separate hydrocarbon accumulations.
Analysis of gas isotope data indicated that 
the encountered hydrocarbon is sourced 
from the same ‘kitchen’ area as Lancaster 
and is therefore most likely to be a light 
oil of a similar API gravity to Lancaster. 
“ Transitioning this project 
from a planning and 
contracting phase to 
project execution is a 
landmark achievement”
– Neil Platt
This interpretation is corroborated by gas 
chromatography, wireline and core data, 
all of which indicate that the encountered 
hydrocarbon is a light oil.
Lincoln has the potential to be similar to 
Lancaster in productivity. The first step in 
realising this potential is for an appraisal well 
to be drilled to confirm hydrocarbon type 
and the ability for the reservoir to deliver a 
flow rate commensurate with commercial 
productivity. Depending on distance from the 
FPSO, an appraisal well has the potential to be 
tied back to the EPS infrastructure.
Halifax well 
Hurricane’s exploration model was that 
Halifax and Lancaster form part of the 
same accumulation, the Greater Lancaster 
Area (GLA) and that the Halifax well would 
encounter a hydrocarbon column with 
a height of at least 980m TVT (based on 
the Lancaster maximum ODT). To evaluate 
the Halifax potential, an exploration well 
was planned to drill to a depth of 1,800m 
TVDSS and the presence of hydrocarbons 
detected by drill stem testing and a detailed 
mudlogging and wireline programme. The 
specific objectives of the well were to: 
i.  Demonstrate the presence of mobile oil 
and an oil water contact below structural 
closure as mapped
ii. Bring an oil sample to surface
The reservoir section was drilled to  
1,801m TVDSS and then tested, after which 
additional drilling deepened the well to 
2,004m TVDSS. The well was a discovery, 
encountering a hydrocarbon column of 
approximately 1 kilometre TVT. Testing was 
unable to acquire a representative reservoir 
fluid sample to surface and consequently 
the oil type cannot be verified. Despite the 
challenges in testing the formation, the 
analysis of gas chromatography, wireline and 
core data indicated that the encountered 
hydrocarbon is most likely a light oil. 
The inability to flow the well during testing 
was due to near-wellbore formation damage 
caused by the use of over-weighted drilling 
mud and chemical additives in the drilling 
brine during well operations. The near-
wellbore formation damage was further 
compounded by a bullheading operation 
(forcibly pumping fluids into the well bore) 
applied during testing in an attempt to clean 
up the formation. In fact, the bullheading 
forced drill cutting material (a combination 
of rock cuttings, rock flour, and chemically 
enhanced drilling brine) further into the 
formation, thus drastically reducing near-
wellbore permeability. 
The well has been suspended and therefore 
has the potential to be re-entered for the 
purpose of further drill stem testing and/or 
deepening. A decision to re-enter the well will 
be based on ongoing technical work and the 
Group’s Rona Ridge asset appraisal strategy.
The Halifax discovery has the potential to be 
similar to Lancaster in productivity potential. 
The first step in realising this potential is for 
an appraisal well to be drilled to confirm 
hydrocarbon type and the ability for the 
reservoir to deliver a flow rate commensurate 
with commercial productivity. Further 
appraisal work will also be required to test 
the Company’s exploration model that 
Halifax and Lancaster are part of a single 
hydrocarbon accumulation.
Lancaster CPR findings
A CPR was issued for Lancaster in 2017 as an 
update to the previous CPR released in 2013. 
The 2017 CPR supports the Company’s view 
of an extensive oil column on Lancaster and 
the basement reservoir being productive. 
The range of oil water contacts has 
narrowed on Lancaster since 2013 as a result 
of the 2016 Lancaster drilling campaign. 
The previous 2C depth of 1,597m TVDSS 
has become the new 1C depth, and the 3C 
contact is now 103m shallower compared to 
2013 at 1,678m TVDSS. 
RPS assigns 2P Reserves of 37.3 million 
stock tank barrels of oil attributed to the 
initial six-year period of the planned EPS. 
An additional 486 million stock tank barrels 
of 2C Contingent Resources are based on a 
recovery factor of 22.5%. Combined, this is 
an increase of 162% compared to the 2013 
estimate of 200 million stock tank barrels 
of oil. Should Hurricane extend the EPS to 
10 years, 2P Reserves volume would rise to 
62.1 million barrels. The expectation is that 
within the six-year base case duration of 
the EPS, full field planning and development 
will be undertaken. However, should it be 
commercially attractive, the Company has 
the ability to extend the contract duration 
with Bluewater for the Aoka Mizu for a 
further four years.

Halifax CPR findings
A second CPR was issued by RPS in 2017 
covering the Halifax and Lincoln discoveries, 
as well as including the Whirlwind and 
Strathmore discoveries as reported in 2013. 
RPS has agreed with Hurricane’s view that 
Halifax has comparable reservoir properties 
to Lancaster. RPS states that the drill 
stem test carried out on the Halifax well 
was compromised by induced formation 
damage, as discussed above, rather than 
limited flow being a function of reservoir 
quality. RPS is supportive of the observation 
that no data so far acquired indicates that 
there are any significant differences in oil 
type between Lancaster and Halifax. Halifax 
water properties are also comparable to 
Lancaster, indicating the potential for a 
common aquifer. RPS also recognise that 
the difference in oil water contact depths 
between Lancaster and Halifax does not 
preclude them from being part of the 
same structure. However, as an alternative 
model to a single accumulation at Lancaster 
and Halifax, a major fault that bisects 
the Rona Ridge to the east of Lancaster 
and southwest of Halifax could act as a 
boundary between the two accumulations. 
Halifax has been assigned 2C Contingent 
Resources of 1,235 million barrels of oil 
equivalent. 
Lincoln CPR findings
As with Halifax, RPS is supportive of 
Hurricane’s interpretation of basement 
reservoir properties at Lincoln being 
comparable with Lancaster. Oil properties 
are also recognised as being likely to be the 
same as Lancaster. Due to the presence 
of deep oil on the Lincoln structure, RPS 
recognises that a seal must exist between 
Lancaster and Lincoln and agree that 
Hurricane’s interpretation that the Brynhild 
Fault Zone is the most likely candidate for the 
seal is robust. Although RPS believes there 
is the potential for Warwick and Lincoln to 
be part of the same accumulation, it has 
conservatively assigned them as two separate 
accumulations constrained by regional 
faulting. A successful exploration well on 
Warwick followed up by appraisal drilling will 
ultimately be required to determine if Lincoln 
and Warwick are connected. 
Lincoln has been assigned 2C Contingent 
Resources of 604 mmboe, and Warwick 
has been assigned Prospective Resources 
of 935 mmboe. 
Project Development 
FEED and long lead items
During 2017, the Group completed Front 
End Engineering and Design (FEED) work 
in relation to the key elements of the EPS 
development. This included FEED work in 
relation to:
a)  upgrade and life extension of the  
Aoka Mizu FPSO, and fabrication of  
a new turret mooring system buoy,  
with Bluewater;
b)  SURF, and Subsea Production System 
(SPS) with TechnipFMC; and
c)  well completions with Petrofac Facilities 
Management Limited (PFML). 
The results of these studies allowed detailed 
budgeting to take place, which informed 
our mid-year capital raise and formed the 
basis for the Board to be able to take FID in 
mid-2017.
To maintain the target first oil date of 
H1 2019, whilst taking advantage of the 
market conditions at the time, Hurricane 
had identified and placed orders for certain 
schedule-critical long lead items using the 
results of initial FEED work in 2016. During 
2017 , in parallel with ongoing FEED studies, 
the Group continued to place orders, carry 
out surveys and make milestone payments 
on these pre-sanction items. In particular, we 
placed orders for the TechnipFMC Xmas trees 
and subsea control modules in late 2016. This 
enabled both Xmas trees and their respective 
control modules to be delivered ex-works in 
time for the commencement of the planned 
completion campaign in Q2 2018. 
Contracting
The Group had chosen three Tier 1 
contractors for the EPS, with each having 
primary responsibility for a specific key area 
of operations. 
Bluewater is responsible for provision of 
the project’s FPSO upgrade scope of work 
and associated turret mooring system 
under an engineering, procurement and 
construction (EPC) Contract. Under the 
agreement, Bluewater Energy Services is 
contracted to fabricate and deliver a new 
mooring system and buoy and the upgrade, 
hook up and testing of the FPSO. Following 
first oil, the Bluewater group entities will be 
responsible for the operation, maintenance 
and decommissioning of the FPSO, and 
the operation and maintenance of the 
subsea pipeline, pursuant to the terms of a 
Production Operating Services Agreement 
(POSA). A Bluewater group entity, Bluewater 
Lancaster Production (U.K.) Limited, has also 
been approved as installation operator and 
pipeline operator.
In another example of innovative 
contracting, Bluewater is incentivised to 
reach first oil and deliver stable production 
through an incentive tariff. This is based 
on a percentage of the sale price of each 
barrel of oil, after deducting certain 
costs and is higher for the first two years 
(in exchange for a reduced day rate), 
encouraging prompt commissioning.
In addition to external contracting, 
Hurricane has also expanded its internal 
organisation structure to suit its role 
as licence operator and expanded the 
operations team to satisfy the roles 
required by the EPS development. These 
enhancements have been made in a 
targeted manner, to avoid potential 
inefficiency from overlapping with our Tier 
1 contractors, whilst also enabling Hurricane 
to effectively coordinate the development.
Regulatory approval
The Group’s regulatory approvals passed 
a critical juncture with the approval 
of the Group’s FDP in September 2017. 
This was the culmination of a period of 
extensive engagement both directly with 
regulators and with other stakeholders, 
including via a public consultation on the 
Environmental Statement.
Review of Operations continued
The FDP approval for the EPS was the first 
approval for a standalone development 
in the UKCS since Culzean in 2015. It is 
also the first ever approval of a basement 
development in the UK. The ability of the 
project to reach sanction whilst so few 
other developments are doing so illustrates 
the attractiveness of the Lancaster field 
and of fractured basement on the Rona 
Ridge as a whole. 
We would like to extend our thanks to the 
Oil and Gas Authority, the Department 
for Business, Energy, Industrial Strategy, 
and the Health and Safety Executive and 
all other consultees for their support in 
Hurricane progressing to this stage. 
Development progress
Hurricane’s progress towards first oil on 
the EPS is unmistakeably evident at Dubai 
Drydocks World, the yard selected by 
Bluewater for the upgrade and life extension 
of the Aoka Mizu and the fabrication of 
the buoy for the turret mooring system. 
The Aoka Mizu FPSO arrived at the facility 
on 30 September 2017 and has already 
undergone its two planned drydock phases 
and a significant portion of additional work. 
The buoy has been fabricated in parallel and 
following the success of trial fit operations 
in February, is expected to depart Dubai for 
Lerwick on the Shetland Isles in order to 
arrive by the end of H1 2018.
Hurricane has permanent representatives 
onsite in Dubai and has been pleased with 
the standard of safety and operations at the 
facility. Together with Bluewater, Hurricane 
has operated an HSSEQ incentive programme 
and is pleased with the number of awards and 
overall HSSEQ performance to date. Further 
details on this programme are outlined in the 
Sustainability Report section on pages 31 to 
33. The vessel remains on track for sail away 
to the field by the end of Q3 2018.
Progress towards subsea installation by 
TechnipFMC and its subcontractors has 
also been substantial. The second of the 
two horizontal Xmas trees and associated 
structures were delivered ex-works in March 
2018 and fabrication of the umbilical, risers 
and flowlines remains on schedule. Following 
a programme of boulder relocation during 
2017, ahead of schedule, everything remains 
on track for summer 2018 installation.
Hurricane has shown that it has an effective 
working relationship with Petrofac Facilities 
Management Limited and Transocean on 
previous drilling campaigns, and is looking 
forward to using the Paul B. Loyd Jr. rig for 
well completions later this year.
Future operations
In parallel with the focus on delivering 
first oil from the EPS, Hurricane’s well 
operations teams continue to work closely 
with Hurricane’s subsurface team to study 
future well opportunities, whilst the facilities 
engineering team are engaged in looking 
at future gas export and tie-back options, 
FPSO debottlenecking opportunities and 
performance improvements from the 
existing EPS design. 
Neil Platt
Chief Operations Officer
“ We chose our Tier 1 
contractors on the basis 
of demonstrable industry 
reputation, technical 
expertise, health safety 
and environmental track 
record, and supportive 
contractual structures”
“ Hu r r ic a n e b e l iev e s  
that its approach to 
contracting has helped 
to reduce schedule and 
budget risk to the project, 
thereby maximising 
chance of success”
TechnipFMC is responsible for the 
fabrication, installation, testing and 
commissioning of the subsea equipment, 
including the SURF and SPS under the terms 
of the TechnipFMC Integrated engineering, 
procurement, construction and installation 
(EPCI) Contract and the installation of the 
mooring system and buoy.
Responsibility for Hurricane’s well integrity, 
future drilling activities and EPS well 
completions and a number of well control 
packages, including variable speed drives, 
subsea control modules lies with PFML. The 
Group has a longstanding relationship with 
PFML, which in this role has been nominated 
as Hurricane’s well operator and well 
management services provider in relation to 
the EPS, as well as our broader appraisal and 
exploration programme.
Hurricane believes that its approach to 
contracting has helped to reduce schedule 
and budget risk to the project, thereby 
maximising chance of success. The Group 
focussed on a small number of highly 
competent contractors, reducing interfaces 
and giving each a meaningful stake in 
the project. In the case of Bluewater and 
TechnipFMC, large lump sum components 
were included, thereby passing back a large 
portion of the cost risk and meaning that 
Hurricane’s contingency within the budget 
is applicable to only the remaining costs, 
which represent less than 25% of the total.

Year Ended 31 December 2017
Overview
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
In 2017, Hurricane transitioned from 
being a pure exploration and appraisal 
company to one that is undertaking a 
significant development project and fast 
approaching first oil. 
Therefore, the Group purchased the required 
USD at the time of the July capital raise in 
order to match our currency exposures and 
thereby mitigate the foreign currency risk on 
the project.
The Group’s loss after tax for the year 
was $7.0 million (2016: profit after tax $0.9 
million). This loss was driven by increased 
operating expenses, predominantly related to 
increased corporate activity, and write-offs/
impairments connected with our non-core 
assets. These charges were partially offset 
by a fair value gain on derivative financial 
instruments related to the Convertible Bond 
and foreign exchange gains.
At the beginning of 2017 , the functional 
currency for each entity and the presentation 
currency for the Group as a whole was 
reviewed. Due to the increase in the 
Group’s level of expenditure in USD and the 
upcoming start of production on the EPS, 
the revenues for which will be denominated 
in USD, the functional currency of many of 
the entities within the Group was changed 
to be USD. The presentation currency for 
the consolidated accounts has also been 
changed to USD which will also improve the 
ability to compare the Group’s financial results 
with other companies within the oil and gas 
industry. This has led to a restatement of prior 
period comparatives and a $(92.7) million 
foreign exchange reserve being recognised 
within equity on the Balance Sheet. 
Our principal financial goals are to manage the 
existing funds held by the Group to deliver 
the EPS on schedule and on budget. This will 
bring us to the point where the EPS begins to 
generate free cash which can be directed to 
deliver the Group’s long-term strategy.
Financial Review
– Alistair Stobie
Having raised the required funding and taken 
FID on the EPS, the Group is now looking 
forward to organic cash generation. 
The first half of the year was focussed on 
positioning the Group to be able to take FID. 
To this end the Group raised a total of $547 
million in two fund raises (before expenses). 
The first of which, occurring in May 2017, 
raised $17 million enabling the Group to 
maintain the existing schedule for the EPS 
and continue to drive towards FID. The more 
significant raise, in July 2017, raised a total 
of $530 million, split between $300 million 
of equity and $230 million of convertible 
bonds. This was one of the key requirements 
allowing the Group to take FID in the 
second half of the year. The raise was an 
outstanding achievement for a company of 
Hurricane’s size, particularly in the prevailing 
oil price environment.
As the Group worked through the EPS 
contracting strategy in 2017, we were able 
to agree lump sum prices for the majority 
of the capital expenditure. Over 75% of the 
total EPS capital costs are fixed, with the risk 
of overruns lying with the contractor. This 
has enabled Hurricane to manage the risk 
of cost overruns, limiting it mainly to the 
subsea and mooring installation phase of the 
project. The project remains on budget and 
on schedule with first oil, and the related 
cash inflows, expected in H1 2019.
Throughout the year, and into early 2018, 
the foreign exchange rate between the 
Pound Sterling (GBP) and the US Dollar 
(USD) has fluctuated significantly. The 
contracting strategy adopted for the EPS 
has allowed us to reliably forecast the 
project expenditure in both GBP and USD. 
“ We were able to  
agree lump sum prices  
for the majority of our 
capital expenditure”
Use of funds
In 2017 the Group’s primary use of 
funds were:
i.  Halifax exploration well, $30.9 million – 
drilled in Q1, discovering oil in the  
Halifax prospect;
ii.  Development expenditure on the EPS, 
$234.8 million – this includes the pre-  
and post-FID expenditure incurred in  
the year;
iii.  Operating cash outflow, $8.1 million 
(2016: $5.6 million) – this increase on the 
prior year reflects the increase in the level 
of activity through the year, including the 
preparation for the fund raising and the 
additional work undertaken as the Group 
evolves into a larger entity; and 
iv.  Convertible Bond coupon payments,  
$4.3 million.
Income Statement
The Group’s loss after tax for the year is $7.0 
million (2016: profit after tax $0.9 million). 
The loss for the year was partly driven by 
increased operating expenses, but also 
impacted by foreign exchange gains of $8.0 
million due to the strengthening of Sterling 
against the US Dollar, a fair value gain on 
derivative financial instruments related to 
the Convertible Bond and the write-off of 
the relinquished Typhoon and Tempest 
exploration and evaluation assets and the  
full impairment of the Strathmore asset.
The increase in other operating expenses 
from $8.9 million in 2016 to $14.6 million in 
201 7 reflects the increased level of corporate 
activity in the year and the work done in 
preparation for the fund raising. Whilst the 
average headcount has increased from 15 to 
21 since the prior year, the overall cash staff 
cost (excluding share based payment expense) 
is largely unchanged (201 7: $5.2 million, 2016 
$5.6 million, both before amounts capitalised).
The accounting for the Convertible Bond 
(issued in July 2017) required the recognition 
of an embedded derivative related to the 
deemed equity conversion option. The 
fair value of this embedded derivative was 
calculated on the date of issue of the bonds 
and at the 31 December 2017. The movement 
of $10.4 million in this fair value has been 
recognised as a gain in the Income Statement 
in the year. Transaction costs relating to the 
Convertible Bond have been apportioned 
between the host debt contract and the 
embedded derivative. Those transactions 
costs apportioned to the embedded 
derivative have been recognised in the 
Income Statement ($1.2 million). Interest 
costs of $10.4 million for the Convertible 
Bond during the year have been capitalised.
In December 2017 , the Group took the 
decision to relinquish the Typhoon and 
Tempest licences to focus both time and 
funds on its Rona Ridge assets. As a direct 
consequence the related capitalised assets 
(within intangible exploration and evaluation 
assets) have been written off. In addition to 
this, the Group has also fully impaired the 
carrying value of its Strathmore asset as there 
are no plans to undertake any significant 
activity on this prospect in the near future. 
The $10.4 million write off / impairment is not 
a cash cost in the year but is included as an 
expense in the Income Statement.
Due to the nature of the Group’s business, 
it has accumulated significant tax losses 
since incorporation. Upon receipt of 
FDP approval in September 2017 , for tax 
purposes, the Group is considered to have 
commenced trading. This has crystallised 
the pre-trading revenue expenses of $21.6 
million (2016: $23.9 million), covering the 
period from 2011 onwards, and pre-trading 
capital expenditure of $191.1 million (2016: 
$257.1 million) which was available for tax 
relief on commencement of trade for UK 
tax purposes. Additional pre-trading capital 
expenditure of $83.5 million is carried forward 
at 31 December 2017 and tax relief will be 
available once the FDP approval is received on 
the remaining licences. The Group has trading 
losses of $393.6 million at 31 December 2017 , 
which would be available for offset against 
future trading profits. A potential Ring Fence 
Expenditure Supplement claim could also be 
made which would result in additional trading 
losses of $65.0 million.

Income Statement continued
No asset has been recognised in the 
Financial Statements for a potential deferred 
tax asset, at the UK ring-fence tax rate of 
40%, of $16.1 million (2016: $12.4 million) 
resulting from the effect of carried forward 
trading losses, after offsetting $141.2 million 
(2016: $11.2 million) against a deferred tax 
liability. The directors have concluded it 
is not appropriate to recognise any of the 
potential deferred tax asset until the EPS has 
begun production and hence demonstrated 
an ability to generate taxable profits. The 
directors have concluded it not appropriate 
to recognise any of the potential deferred 
tax asset until the Lancaster EPS has begun 
production and hence demonstrated an 
ability to generate taxable profits.
Exploration and evaluation assets  
and property, plant and equipment
In September 2017 the Group obtained FDP 
approval from the Oil and Gas Authority 
and as such reclassified $335.9 million, being 
all intangible exploration and evaluation 
assets that related to the Lancaster Field, to 
property, plant and equipment. Following 
this reclassification, a further $109.4 
million was included in property, plant and 
equipment relating to the EPS.
In total, additional expenditure of $169.1 
million was included in intangible exploration 
and evaluation assets in the year relating to 
the drilling of the Halifax well and pre-FDP 
expenditure on the EPS. Taking into account 
the reclassification of Lancaster assets to 
property, plant and equipment and the 
write off / impairment of Typhoon/Tempest 
and Strathmore has resulted in an overall 
decrease in the Group’s intangible exploration 
and evaluation assets of $176.1 million.
Our approach to sustainability
Our work in sustainability is integral to 
successful execution of our business 
strategy and is underpinned by  
our commitment to work in accordance  
with the Hurricane values.
Our Values are:
• Straightforward – we keep it simple
• Ingenious – we see what others miss
• Tenacious – we never give up
• Collaborative – the whole is greater than 
the sum of parts
• Logical – it all adds up
As an oil and gas company, our most 
important issues are long-term and we 
consider these on an annual basis, at a 
minimum. We recognise the importance 
of health and safety, environmental 
stewardship, our employees, ethical 
conduct, stakeholder relations and leaving 
a positive legacy in the communities where 
we operate. Our daily operations prioritise 
protecting the environment and health  
and safety.
Working effectively with others is essential 
to us. Our main stakeholders include: 
investors; governments; employees; 
contractors; suppliers and regulators. We 
aim to work in a transparent and accessible 
way and tailor our engagement processes 
to suit each group. Feedback and open 
dialogue allows us to consider a wide 
perspective of views, which inform our 
work on our sustainability issues.
Cash and debt
The Group finished the year with a closing 
cash position of $326.6 million in usable funds 
(including cash and cash equivalents and liquid 
investments, but excluding cash held in escrow 
accounts). The mid-year capital raise included 
the issue of $230 million in convertible bonds 
with a coupon of 7 .5% per annum. Under the 
terms of the Convertible Bond, the first two 
years of coupon payments have been placed 
in escrow, of which $4.3 million was paid out 
by the year-end. The maturity date of the 
Convertible Bond is July 2022, although bond 
holders have the option to convert the bonds 
to Ordinary Shares before that time. The 
initial conversion price on the bonds was set 
at $0.52, representing a 25% premium to the 
share price fixed at the time of issue (being 
£0.32 converted into USD at a rate of $1.30).
The Convertible Bond is recorded on the 
Balance Sheet, and is split between the host 
debt contract and the embedded derivative 
related to the equity conversion option. At 
the Balance Sheet date the fair value of the 
embedded derivative was $28.6 million and 
the carrying value of the host debt contract at 
amortised cost was $191. 1 million. The Group 
recognised a $10.4 million gain on derivative 
financial instruments from the Convertible 
Bond’s issue to the Balance Sheet date.
Cash flow
Net cash outflow from operating activities of 
$8. 1 million is an increase from $5.6 million in 
2016, largely due to the increase in the level 
of activity through the year. This included 
the preparation for the fund raising and the 
additional work undertaken as the Group 
evolves into a larger entity. The combined 
expenditure on intangible exploration and 
evaluation assets and property, plant and 
Oversight and accountability  
at Hurricane
The Board has significant experience in the 
sustainability issues that face the oil industry 
and our business in particular. Our board 
members bring with them high standards and 
clear vision across sustainability related areas. 
The directors take a close interest in the 
management of issues across the cycle, from 
impact assessments and feasibility studies 
through early stage drilling campaigns, to final 
stages of project development. 
The Board assesses and monitors 
sustainability related risks within its 
oversight of principal risks. Ethical 
conduct and anti-fraud practices are also 
monitored in this forum, in accordance 
with the whistleblowing policy and other 
business standards. The Health and Safety 
Environmental Management (HSEM) 
Committee is responsible for recommending 
polices on health and safety, and 
environmental issues to the Board, chaired 
by the Chief Executive Officer. The Technical 
Advisory Committee is chaired by a non-
executive director. The committee has no 
formal decision-making powers but makes 
recommendations and provides assistance 
to the Board with respect to technical and 
operating matters.
Working in partnership
Engagement and collaboration with others 
is essential to how we work to identify 
and reduce the impacts of our activities. 
Our employees are selected, trained and 
developed to carry out their duties safely, 
competently and with due care. We provide 
a clear feedback structure, establish 
appropriate operating practices and 
implement training programmes to ensure 
effective delivery on our policies.
Suppliers and contractors, relevant third 
parties and other companies are also aware 
of our policies, standards and commitment 
to good practices. We continually work with 
them, sharing best practice and seeking out 
synergies to improve performance. 
Sharing ideas is important to us. Hurricane 
is a member of many international, national 
and industry associations and groups. Our 
work in collaboration with others gives us a 
wide perspective and the opportunity to be 
both a contributor and learner in addressing 
sustainability challenges. Finding workable 
solutions both for our business, and the oil 
industry as a whole, is important to us. 
Ethical conduct
Our commitment to acting with integrity, 
fairness and transparency is the cornerstone 
to the way we do business. Our anti-
corruption and bribery policy and our work 
to impart our values and standards on all 
who work with us is testimony to that. 
We believe this approach is essential for 
delivering our business strategy.
Bribery and corruption risk is considered in 
our overall approach to risk management at 
Hurricane. We have policies and procedures 
in place to manage ethical conduct risks. We 
also work on the detection and prevention 
of fraud and monitor and report any findings. 
Our framework covers our work with third 
parties as well as our own workforce. Ethical 
conduct standards give guidance in many 
areas including the procurement of goods 
and services and everyday production and 
operational activities.
Financial Review continued Sustainability Report 
equipment in the year of $265.7 million (2016: 
$63.5 million) was primarily the expenditure on 
the EPS and the Halifax well.
The net cash provided by financing activities 
was $524.4 million. This was from the capital 
raises in May and July and the Convertible 
Bond issue in July. This was partly offset by 
the first quarterly coupon payment on the 
Convertible Bond of $4.3 million.
The net increase in cash, cash equivalents, 
and liquid investments in the year was $258.5 
million (including the effects of foreign 
exchange rate changes).
Going concern and long-term 
viability
The directors have considered both 
the going concern of the Group and its 
long-term viability (LTV). Based on their 
assessment (see details of going concern 
and the LTV on page 23), the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due for the periods shown.
Alistair Stobie
Chief Financial Officer
At Hurricane, we focus on the  
health and safety, environmental,  
social, and governance issues that  
are of significance to our business  
and our stakeholders.
