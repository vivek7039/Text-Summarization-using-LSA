 Q&A 
with the CEO
Current year performance – What have 
been the key drivers of the record trading 
performance in the financial year?
The strong trading result reflects the continued success 
of the value-add business model of the Company and 
the asset management techniques that we use. 
The profit improvements that we have seen this year 
have come from three main areas: acquisitions, organic 
net income growth and further improvements to our 
banking terms.
Our acquisitions have not only made a strong impact 
when acquired but we have quickly been able to improve 
the income that they generate which has led to valuation 
improvements as well. In the financial year ended 
31 March 2016 we acquired €82.7 million of assets with 
a further €103.3 million completing in or shortly after 
the financial year under review with a combined EPRA 
net initial yield of 8.1% and vacancy of 30%. From an 
organic growth perspective, one of the main drivers has 
been the capex investment programme which continues 
to progress well. Our new lettings, renewals and service 
charge initiatives are also producing good results and we 
have seen a further 2.8% increase in the like-for-like rent 
roll for properties held throughout the reporting period 
despite operating in a low inflationary environment.
Total occupancy has remained fairly stable because we 
have been acquiring vacancy through our acquisitions 
but this will fuel our capex investment programme which 
will provide further organic growth into the future.
We have continued to take advantage of the favourable 
financing markets by refinancing two loan facilities 
during the year which reduced our annual interest 
charge by €1.8 million. This along with the full impact 
of the refinancings from the previous financial year 
had a significant impact on this year’s results.
Opportunities going forward – Where do 
you see value being created looking ahead 
into the current financial year and beyond?
The start of the new financial year will be mainly 
about the asset recycling programme following 
the completed disposal of €96.0 million of assets 
and the notarisation for sale of another €7.0 million 
asset. The replacement of these has begun well with 
€27.4 million of acquisition assets completed and a 
further €49.9 million notarised for completion since 
the year end. We will continue to seek a mix of stable 
income and value-add opportunity within the assets 
we acquire and given the strength of our operating 
platform, we feel confident of taking advantage of 
the opportunities within both the existing portfolio 
and the acquired assets in the year ahead and beyond.
Our capex investment programme will continue to 
play a large part in exploiting these opportunities and 
the acquisitions that we have made certainly helped 
in this regard. We have already identified over 43,000sqm 
for investment and transformation on the assets 
acquired in the year under review and more will come 
from the assets acquired and notarised post year end.
Following our disposals we have, and continue to, 
acquire assets with significant vacancy and hence 
opportunity, whilst replacing most of the income lost 
from the mature and non-core assets which were sold. 
Whilst the initial impact of the recycling programme 
will be to reduce income in the year ahead while the

disposal proceeds are reinvested, the impact from the 
value-add opportunities within the assets acquired will 
be much greater for shareholders in the years thereafter.
Macroeconomic – How are German market 
dynamics changing and how well positioned 
is Sirius to take advantage?
The German economy continues to be the largest in 
Europe and continues to be regarded as a favourable 
market in which to invest. A combination of low 
unemployment, monetary policy and the availability 
of low-cost debt has fuelled private and corporate 
spending. The real estate sector itself continues to feel 
the impact of these economic tailwinds with transaction 
volumes up and pricing across all subsectors of the 
real estate market reaching levels not seen for some 
time. Sirius has seen some of this yield shift feeding 
into its valuations but we still believe there is more 
to come before the levels that we are seeing in the 
market are reached.
This robust economic environment has also translated 
into high occupational demand particularly from the 
SME sector which is a key element of the Group’ s tenant 
base. Continued economic growth, as forecasted by 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (“OECD”), is good news for the SME 
market which remains of crucial importance for the 
German economy as a whole. Sirius has benefited 
from a long track record of being able to meet the 
continually changing space requirements of these 
SMEs and expects this to continue going forward.
Financing – Describe your approach to 
financing and managing interest rate risk.
The Company has no appetite for interest rate risk or 
other forms of financing risk which is evidenced by the 
fact 88% of our total debt is fixed with fixed rates or 
swap contracts and the other 12% has an obligation 
to fix one year after drawdown. Our stated objective 
is to achieve a gross LTV rate of less than 40.0% by no 
later than 31 March 2018 and is currently at 42.3%.
We have built many strong relationships with lenders 
and developed their confidence in our operating platform 
which is why they continue to lend to us on favourable 
terms. The current debt in place is well diversified with 
facilities from six lenders as at 31 March 2017 and there 
are a number of other lenders that the Company is 
speaking with.
The current loan book looks strong with an average 
cost of borrowing at less than 2.0%, a weighted 
average debt expiry of 5.8 years and annual interest 
coverage of more than 8.5 times by the Group’s net 
operating income. Along with the lower LTV levels, 
we believe that we are currently in a very strong 
position with our financing.
Looking further ahead the availability and terms 
of financing that are accessible may change; however, 
we believe we are well positioned to deal with this. 
Our approach to financing and interest rate risk will 
always remain steadfast in order to provide as best 
a platform as possible for us to continue to deliver 
attractive risk-adjusted returns to shareholders.
