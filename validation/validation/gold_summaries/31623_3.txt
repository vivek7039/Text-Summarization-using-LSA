 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4
STRATEGIC REPORT
Results 
The Board is pleased to announce strong results for the year 
ended 30 September 2017. These results reflect our position 
as a leading provider of engineering services to many of the 
UK’s critical infrastructure assets and in particular our 
strength in the nuclear, rail and water markets. 
Group revenue, including £2.2m from a joint venture, 
increased by 6.7% to £560.8m (2016: £525.7m) with operating 
profit prior to impairment, amortisation and exceptional items, 
increasing by 16.4% to £25.6m (2016: £22.0m), an operating 
margin of 4.6% (2016: 4.2%). After accounting for impairment, 
amortisation and exceptional items of £8.9m, operating profit 
was £16.6m (2016: £19.0m). After finance costs and tax, 
earnings per share prior to impairment, amortisation and 
exceptional items increased by 21.6% to 33.36p (2016: 27.43p). 
After accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional 
items, basic earnings per share on continuing activities was 
19.88p (2016: 23.53p). 
Exceptional Items
At the end of April 2017, the Group decided to withdraw from 
its loss-making low pressure, small diameter gas pipe 
replacement activities and as a result reviewed the carrying 
value of its investment in that business. The Board 
determined that a non-cash impairment charge of £5.8m 
should be made which is included within exceptional items. 
This was reported in the interim results. Our gas operations 
are now completely focused on medium pressure activities. 
This restructuring has resulted in £0.6m of exceptional 
charges relating to redundancy and other costs. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 6.0p per share, 
increasing the full year dividend by 12.5% to 9.0p (2016: 8.0p). 
The dividend will be paid on 13 March 2018 to shareholders 
on the register as at 2 February 2018.
Order Book
The Group’s order book at 30 September 2017 was £511m 
(2016: £516m), with the Engineering Services order book up 
4% to £438m (2016: £421m). 
Cash
The Board is pleased to record a net cash position of £3.9m 
(2016: £4.8m). This is after expending £7.2m on the acquisition 
of Giffen Holdings Limited (“Giffen”) in November 2016.

Chairman’s statement Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 5
People
Safety remains a top priority and the commitment of our 
employees, and those who work with us, continues to 
improve safe working practices across the Group. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our 
employees for their hard work and commitment which has 
contributed to another successful year for the Group. 
Board Changes 
As previously reported, John Samuel, the Group Finance 
Director, will resign from that position on 29 November 2017 
and will be succeeded by Sean Wyndham-Quin, who joined the 
Group and was appointed to the Board on 8 November 2017.
In April, the Board was pleased to welcome the appointment 
of David Brown as a non-executive Director. 
Having served as a Director since November 2003, I have 
decided to retire at the next Annual General Meeting which 
will be held on 31 January 2018. David Forbes, who has 
served as a non-executive Director since June 2011, will 
assume the position of Chairman providing continuity of 
leadership and I wish David every success going forward. 
Strategy
The Group’s operations focus on delivering essential 
infrastructure maintenance tasks in targeted regulated 
markets within the UK. As a result, we have not experienced 
any adverse impact following the UK’s announcement of its 
intention to withdraw from the European Union nor do we 
expect to. We deliver our services through our clients’ 
non-discretionary operational expenditure programmes 
which provide good visibility of future opportunities and 
sustainable earnings streams. 
We continue to seek out appropriate, earnings enhancing 
acquisitions in our Engineering Services markets. In 
November 2016, we acquired Giffen, a specialist mechanical, 
electrical and power services provider in the rail market. 
Integration with our existing rail business has gone well and 
we believe that our enhanced rail offering strengthens our 
ability to address additional framework opportunities in 
Network Rail’s next funding period, CP6. 
In Specialist Building, the Group focuses on the High Quality 
Residential market in London and the Home Counties where 
we have particular skills in major engineering structural works 
to extend or reconfigure high value properties.
Outlook
The Group is well positioned for the 2017/18 financial year. 
Bank debt will have been completely repaid by 31 March 2018. 
Following a year in which Specialist Building revenue has 
been particularly high, we expect that it will reduce, perhaps 
by as much as £35m, in the 2017/18 financial year. We remain 
confident that we will continue to deliver stable operating 
profits in that business. 
In Engineering Services, the order book provides a solid 
foundation for continued growth.
The Board looks forward with confidence to the Group 
continuing to deliver further strong financial results.
