 Christopher Bailey
Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer
Alongside this more moderate growth outlook, we 
anticipate the industry will be shaped by different  
dynamics in the years ahead. Our customer is evolving 
rapidly, prioritising more distinctive experiences, more 
personal relationships with brands and greater product 
innovation. The influence of digital technology is extending 
still further across every aspect of what we do – from 
production techniques to the customer experience, in every 
channel. And demographic changes, from the maturing  
of millennials to the intensification of wealth in cities,  
mean we must keep developing and tailoring how we  
think and work to stay ahead. 
Against this backdrop, we continued last year to take 
actions to elevate our luxury retail and digital business, 
strengthen our brand and reposition Burberry for growth, 
as we maintained our focus on maximising long-term 
shareholder value. In addition to our ongoing actions in 
wholesale and licensing, this included our announcement 
last May of a multi-year programme to accelerate our 
productivity and efficiency agenda, having identified 
significant opportunities across our existing channels, 
products and regions, and our ways of working. We 
touched on these in our last report, and have since  
distilled them into comprehensive plans covering five  
key areas: Product Focus; Productive Space; E-commerce 
Leadership; Operational Excellence and Inspired People, 
the detail of which I will turn to shortly. 
To deliver on this ambitious programme we have also 
strengthened our executive leadership team with the 
extensive luxury experience of Marco Gobbetti, who will 
take on the role of Chief Executive Officer in July 2017,  
and the transformation expertise of Julie Brown, our new 
Chief Operating and Financial Officer. And we have made 
further appointments over recent months to complement 
and enhance the existing skills of our senior team, including 
in key areas such as design, merchandising, technology 
and brand experience. 
As such, the scope and scale of the changes we are  
making to our business are significant, and it will take  
time to realise their full benefits, particularly in respect  
of revenue growth. But our progress with laying the 
foundations for the future is encouraging.
With recent estimates suggesting a broadly flat 
performance in calendar 2016, the subdued result from  
the sector as a whole reflected fundamental shifts that  
have been shaping the industry over the past few years, 
including slowing Chinese consumption, reduced scope  
for space expansion and less pricing flexibility. The impact 
of these trends was exacerbated during the early part of  
the year by macro factors such as sluggish developed and 
developing economies, and consumer unease and travel 
disruption linked to geopolitical events. 
However, we also began to see clear signs of recovery in 
the industry towards the end of the year, as the Chinese 
consumer rallied, Continental Europe improved and the  
UK continued to enjoy strong tourism with the sustained 
weakness of sterling following the Brexit vote. These 
contributed to an improved sector performance in calendar 
Q4, following nearly two years in flat or negative territory.  
Our own performance was consistent with these  
broader trends.
While these more encouraging signs have continued  
into the start of 2017, some challenges remain – not  
least for us given the uneven performance of the US  
and Hong Kong markets, both key for Burberry. As such,  
the outlook for the sector is mixed, with industry experts 
continuing to anticipate more tempered growth in the 
medium term, compared with the historic highs of the  
post-financial crisis years.
2016/17 was a foundational year for Burberry, in an environment that remained 
challenging for luxury – although with sector dynamics improving in the second half. 
Against this backdrop, we continued to elevate our luxury retail and digital business, 
and began implementing wide-ranging changes for the future.

Strategic Report – Introduction
Chief Creative and Chief 
Executive Officer’s Letter Performance summary
Before turning to our renewed productivity and efficiency 
agenda, let me first summarise our performance  
for 2016/17.
Revenue was £2.8bn for the year, down 2% underlying,  
with retail outperforming at up 3% overall and up  
1% on a comparable store sales basis. A notably  
strong performance in EMEIA, driven by the UK, and an 
acceleration in mainland China were offset by continued 
challenging conditions in other markets including the  
US and Hong Kong, as well by the impact of our ongoing 
actions to build and reinforce our luxury brand positioning 
for the future. This included the loss of licensing income as 
we build our direct operations in Japan, the rationalisation 
of wholesale distribution globally, including in Beauty,  
and actions to protect the brand in a highly promotional 
environment in the US. 
With adjusted profit before tax down 21% underlying to 
£462m, these factors weighed on the bottom line – although 
their impact was partially offset by the delivery of £20m of 
planned cost efficiencies in the year, and our plans are on 
track for at least £100m by 2018/19. 
We ended the year with a strong net cash position, up 
£149m to £809m, and we increased the full year dividend 
to 38.9p, up 5%. In April we completed £100m of a £150m 
announced share buyback. A further share buyback of 
£300m is to be completed in 2017/18, in addition to the 
£50m already announced. This reflects the Board’s 
confidence in the growth prospects for the business and  
its ongoing commitment to maintaining a strong balance 
sheet with solid investment grade metrics. 
While we actively managed the business through  
near-term market dynamics during the year, we also 
continued to take actions to position it more strongly  
for the long term. As noted above, this included starting  
to implement a wide-ranging productivity and efficiency 
programme to enhance future growth. While we are still 
early in this process, progress across its five areas of  
focus underpinned a number of improvements through  
the year – from the outperformance of fashion and strong 
growth in leather goods, to improved mainline retail 
conversion and customer retention, to the delivery of 
enhanced efficiencies. These initial results give us real 
confidence for the future.
Product Focus
The first pillar in this programme is to move from product 
breadth to product focus. This will allow the customer  
to connect more readily with the creativity, craft and 
storytelling that define and differentiate our offer. With 
significant scope to simplify our assortments, amplify the 
excitement in our products across price points and tailor 
our offer more effectively to the needs of the customer  
in different locations, we began to make changes in the 
year to unlock this opportunity.
Building a more strategic approach to drive outperformance 
in our core categories has been a central focus, with 
comprehensive plans now developed for the product areas 
we have identified as having the greatest growth potential 
for the coming years. The first area in which we have begun 
to implement this new approach is bags, with full price 
sales up 16% in the year. In line with our evolved strategy 
for the category, this was driven both by new launches such 
as the Bridle and Buckle bags, as well as increasing novelty 
in our more established styles. While we are still at the  
early stages of our plans for bags, this strong initial uplift  
is illustrative of the benefits we expect to build across other 
areas over time, with a pipeline of categories to follow. 
The second key area of progress is how we are evolving  
our merchandising approach, with particular emphasis  
on cultivating the local customer – a key opportunity for  
us. Our move to one Burberry label globally, together with 
reducing our assortments by 15 to 20% over the year, have 
been fundamental steps in creating the conditions to realise 
this opportunity. Then, within this significantly simplified 
assortment, we have implemented new tools and ways  
of working that mean we are more effectively tailoring our 
assortments to the individual needs of stores in different 
locations – from climate, to customer profile. Finally, this 
more streamlined approach is also allowing us to give  
far greater visibility to the fashion and newness that is  
so critical to building loyalty and repeat custom. This  
was reflected in the outperformance of fashion during  
the year, including the growth of our runway collections  
and the successful introduction of our new, lightweight 
tropical gabardine.
13
Strategic Report – Introduction All this is being enabled by changes to how we work  
across our product functions, to improve collaboration  
and focus from design to delivery. Part of this has been 
structural, with the evolution of our organisational model 
towards an end-to-end category management approach, 
meaning we are building cross-functional teams specific  
to the potential of each category, with shared accountability 
and KPIs. And we are reinforcing these structural changes 
by redesigning our processes as needed, for example 
getting local input earlier in the cycle. This is a significant 
evolution for us and although the changes will take time  
to embed, we are already seeing early benefits across  
our business. 
The final area I would highlight in respect of product is the 
announcement we made just after the year end of a new 
partnership with Coty, to accelerate the growth of Beauty. 
Consistent with our drive for greater focus across our 
product offer, this follows the successful repositioning and 
elevation of the business over four years of direct operation. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to lead all creative aspects 
of Beauty, while benefiting from Coty’s first-class industry 
expertise and distribution. We will transition to this new 
model in October 2017 and expect the deal to be earnings 
accretive from 2018/19.
Productive Space
Our second pillar is to move from new space to productive 
space. Following a decade of geographic expansion, our 
focus in this next phase is shifting to how we make all our 
space more productive – retail and wholesale, online and 
offline, and with an emphasis on our full-price channels.  
We have significant opportunity here. 
The foundation of our activity over the past year has  
been our Retail Excellence programme, covering all 
aspects of our retail operations, including how we serve  
our customers, approach customer cultivation and manage  
our stores. Results this year show good early traction. 
Within service, we increased our investment in training  
and introduced a new service model (‘CLIENT’), and  
we are currently embedding a new global customer 
feedback programme based on net promoter scores.  
These actions helped drive improvements in conversion 
and retention globally – with room for continued growth. 
Within cultivation, we accelerated the expansion of our 
Customer Value Management programme and Private 
Client teams to bring more customers closer to our  
brand and products through appointments, events and 
experiences. This richer, more personalised approach 
drove a significant uplift in repeat business in the year. 
Finally, within operations, investments in areas including 
point of sale systems and new staff scheduling tools drove 
improvements as we seek to standardise and simplify  
our processes globally. A standout area of progress here 
was our omni-channel programme, which has significantly 
increased the amount of product available to our online 
customers by enabling us to fulfil e-commerce orders  
from store stock. 
Alongside this initial emphasis on our retail business we are 
sharpening our focus on how we inspire customers more 
consistently across channels, not least working closely with 
our wholesale partners to create a stronger, more carefully 
curated Burberry offer globally. With scope to accelerate 
this activity to drive still-greater coherence and support 
brand perception, this is important work for the future.
E-commerce Leadership
Through early investment and focus, we have established  
a leading position in digital in our industry, with more  
than 48 million followers on social media worldwide  
and a ‘Genius’ ranking from the influential think-tank L2.  
We aim to consolidate this leadership position over the 
coming years, while deploying it more assertively to drive 
online sales on our own website, and through third parties.  
From enabling seamless customer journeys across digital 
platforms, to using technology to service our customers  
in stores, and – critically – linking these online and offline 
worlds, we are well-placed to extend our leadership in  
this area. 
The evolution of Burberry.com was a key focus during  
the year. The relaunch of the global site on mobile and 
desktop offered customers a richer brand experience at  
the same time as better functionality, improving conversion 
on both platforms and driving mobile to nearly 60% of our 
online traffic. Meanwhile, the redesign of our China site to 
tailor it more effectively to local preferences and behaviours 
drove increases of around 70% in direct-to-consumer 
sales, while giving valuable insights for our overall site 
development for the future. Finally, we soft-launched  
our new customer app towards the end of the year, ahead  
of a global rollout early in 2017/18. This will offer a more 
personalised shopping experience for our customers,  
both online and by linking them more effectively to our 
stores and sales associates globally.
14
Strategic Report – Introduction This emphasis on facilitating experiences across the 
physical and digital worlds has long been a focus for 
Burberry, because it reflects how our customers live  
today. And we have never been more excited about the 
opportunities that technology offers in this space, nor  
more convinced it must be central to how we evolve our 
offer. Whether partnering with leaders in social media to 
bring our physical moments to life for online audiences,  
or enabling purchases straight from the runway for next  
day delivery globally, we see great future potential here. 
Finally, we saw particularly strong growth in sales through 
third parties over the year, as we enhanced our focus on 
developing our relationships in this space. For example,  
we collaborated with established offline partners including 
Harrods in London, Shinsegae in Korea and Barneys in the 
US to develop unique products and experiences for their 
websites; we deepened our relationships with pure play 
online retailers such as My Theresa and Moda Operandi 
through elevated digital experiences for our runway shows 
and collections; and we continued to innovate in the area  
of social commerce, including making exclusive products 
available for purchase via WeChat. These kinds of 
partnerships will form an important part of realising  
our future e-commerce ambitions and we have exciting 
plans ahead.
Operational Excellence
Our fourth pillar, Operational Excellence, is focused on 
driving efficiency and investing appropriately to support  
our wider growth plans. We have real headroom in this 
area, with particular scope to simplify our processes, 
procure more effectively, optimise our inventory 
management and improve information and technology. 
Turning first to processes, following a detailed review of 
opportunities to standardise activities across our shared 
services we moved towards a simpler, single global way  
of working during the year, which drove good initial results. 
We intend to accelerate these in 2017/18 with the planned 
establishment of Burberry Business Services in Leeds,  
a new centre of excellence in which we intend to bring 
together our UK and EMEIA shared services teams from 
Commercial Procurement, Finance and HR, as well as 
some customer service and IT roles.
In procurement, we have begun to make changes that  
will enable us to realise significant financial benefits  
over time, including through the implementation of a  
new technology solution to streamline how we manage  
our non-stock purchases and using customer insight  
data to target our marketing spend more effectively. 
We also made further improvements to our inventory 
management process as we seek to provide our customers 
with a great experience, wherever and however they are 
shopping with us. Actions during the year included the 
expansion of our single pool of inventory programme,  
which allows us to fulfil customer orders from stock in  
both hubs and stores; quicker delivery times and enhanced 
delivery information for online purchases; and a new, 
facilitated returns process. 
Finally, the further development of our technology 
infrastructure is underpinning many of these early  
advances and will be central to delivering on our broader 
commitments across all of our strategic priorities over  
time. With work well progressed for new digital tools  
that will improve how we operate in areas from planning,  
to supply chain, to enhancing customer service in stores,  
we have an ambitious plan in place to initiate further 
changes to our systems over the coming year. This will 
prioritise business continuity, security and the rollout of  
a common, standardised technology platform globally,  
to facilitate efficiency business-wide. 
Inspired People
These changes to our systems and processes will be 
complemented by an evolution of our overall ways of 
working, which form a critical part of our final pillar, Inspired 
People. Our focus here is to ensure we have the right skills 
and capabilities to meet our strategic objectives, that we 
build an organisation that is the right shape and size for  
the future, and that our teams are motivated and inspired. 
We consider this work fundamental to the successful 
delivery of our overall productivity and efficiency ambitions, 
and are putting commensurate energy and care into  
its execution as we manage our organisation through  
a period of significant change. 
An important early step has been detailed work to  
consider how we might evolve our operating model.  
This has focused on how our structure could better  
support our aims of driving greater global consistency  
while better meeting the needs of our local customers,  
as well as simplifying our broader ways of working.  
We are currently concluding this work as we design  
our organisation for the future, and changes are  
already underway. 
15
Strategic Report – Introduction In tandem with changes to how we are structured  
and how we work, we have also renewed our focus on 
culture through a more vibrant engagement programme, 
designed to reignite our values of ‘Protect, Explore and 
Inspire’ and our distinctive pioneering spirit. From initiatives 
designed to immerse every employee in the creativity  
and craft behind our products, to new forums that bring 
together our global teams around shared priorities, we 
continue to explore new ways to inspire and connect our 
people. This has been further reinforced by an increased 
emphasis on fostering talent at all levels in the Company, 
with highlights in the year including the graduation of our 
first cohort of Burberry Apprentices and enhanced training 
and development opportunities. 
The final area I would highlight under Inspired People is our 
wider commitment to the places and communities where 
we live and work. This is a fundamental part of our culture 
as an organisation, and our focus on this area in recent 
years has seen us make a real impact, from the reductions 
in the environmental impact of our operations that saw us 
named last year as a Textiles, Apparel and Luxury Goods 
industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 
the first time, to the real difference we have made to the 
lives of thousands of disadvantaged young people around 
the world through the work of the Burberry Foundation.
Encouraged by this progress and with the appetite to  
do much more, we finalised plans during the year to bring 
together our sustainability work, philanthropic giving and 
volunteering under a new and more ambitious Burberry 
Responsibility strategy. This is designed to address the 
most material social and environmental challenges in and 
around our operational footprint and will focus on three 
areas: positively impacting the communities that sustain 
our industry; creating positive change through all our 
products; and achieving carbon neutrality and revaluing 
waste. Each of these will have a set of challenging,  
public-facing goals and a flagship programme to be 
delivered hand-in-hand with expert partners. We look 
forward to announcing the detail of this programme soon.
Clear objectives, timelines and success measures  
are now in place for each of these five strategies, and  
their delivery is being overseen by a newly established 
Transformation Management Office, reporting to our  
Chief Operating and Financial Officer.
Looking ahead 
And so, to close, a final few words about the future.
This will be my last letter to you as Chief Creative and  
Chief Executive Officer of Burberry, with Marco assuming 
the role of Chief Executive Officer in July. In many ways,  
I see one of the highlights of my term as Chief Executive 
Officer as the recruitment of Marco to be a partner for me, 
and a great leader for this Company. As I transition into  
the new role of President and Chief Creative Officer, this 
evolved structure will allow me to redouble my focus on 
design for this next phase, and on making products and 
telling stories that inspire our customers. This is the 
essence of who we are, and what we do – and my passion 
for making Burberry the most compelling brand, selling the 
most beautiful and finely crafted products, in the most 
innovative ways has never been stronger. 
Over the past three years I have worked with our  
leadership team to put Burberry on what we believe  
is the right track for the coming years, through a period  
of real challenge and change for our business and the 
industry as a whole. And, with a clear plan now in place,  
I will remain fully engaged with the implementation of  
this plan in my new role as I partner with Marco and our 
evolved senior leadership team to drive the Company’s 
future strategic direction. 
So it is with huge optimism that I look forward to the  
next chapter for this brand of which I am so proud.
Over the past 161 years, Burberry has never stood still.  
In the past 15 years alone, this is a Company that has 
transformed from a predominantly licensed business,  
to a wholesale business, to our focus today on creating  
a leading luxury retail and digital business for this next 
phase. Which means we have shown our ability to change 
and adapt in the past – and we are now positioned to  
do so again for the future. 
With so much opportunity identified across our business 
and a detailed programme in place to unlock it, we know 
this will be challenging work – and it will take time. But we 
are also confident of its rewards. With the right team and 
ways of working in place, we are ready.
