Our key focus areas
Original game content  
& IP development
We build original content from our own 
London, Victoria and Brest based studios 
incorporating social meta games and real 
money mechanics with well-known brands.
Data and algorithmic 
optimisation
‘It’s all about the data’ - from advanced 
algorithms to individual landing pages 
designed to give the player an optimised 
experience.
Responsible  
gambling
Gaming Realms is committed to providing 
an environment for customers to play 
responsibly and securely. Since commencing 
operations we have had measures in place 
to encourage responsible play – to keep it 
fun – and have provided tools to help keep 
customers’ gaming and spending within  
their control. 
Gaming Realms has worked closely with 
other operators to help develop and shape 
a responsible approach to customers across 
the industry. Internally, we regularly conduct 
training for all our employees to raise 
awareness of problem gambling. 
Our marketing and advertising strategies 
comply with the Committee of Advertising 
Practice (CAP), the Broadcast Committee of 
Advertising Practice (BCAP) and the Industry 
Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) 
advertising codes. Gaming Realms has also 
implemented new policies in response to the 
published guidelines from the UK Gambling 
Commission and the Competition and 
Markets Authority to ensure our terms are 
clear and fair.
In addition, we fund research, education 
and treatment of problem gambling through 
donations to GambleAware.
In 2017 we made several improvements to 
our processes to improve risk profiling and 
alerts for customers who may exhibit signs 
of problem gambling. We also established 
a dedicated team to focus on identifying 
concerns around problem gambling, source 
of funds and affordability.
All our customers have access to tools to help 
manage their gameplay, including:
 » Session reminders – alerting customers when 
they’ve been playing for a set period
 » Deposit Limits – customers can set daily, 
weekly or monthly deposit limits
 » Cool down – customers may configure a 
period of time in days or weeks during which 
play on any of our sites will be stopped
 » Self-exclusion – customers may exclude 
themselves permanently from all our sites
Advanced mobile  
gaming platform
We have invested significantly in our  
mobile based gambling and social  
platforms powered by algorithmic  
CRM and personalised content. Our real 
money gaming business is operated  
from Guernsey and fully licensed by  
the UK Gambling Commission for both 
development and operation.
Strategic partners  
and licensing
Partners include Fremantle, Zynga, IWG,  
Pala Interactive and Scientific Games.  
Not only do we leverage our own IP  
across multiple brands, but we also  
license Slingo into markets adjacent  
to the Group’s core mobile gaming business.
