Organisational structure
To sharpen our execution, greater  
decision-making capabilities and  
direct accountability for performance  
have been allocated to our regions.
Enhanced Research & Development
While our R&D costs fell by 1.0% on a 
constant currency basis during 2016/17 , 
this reflected efficiencies achieved through 
expanding our presence in Hyderabad, 
India and reducing costs in other locations. 
Overall capabilities were not reduced.

pages 22 and 23.
Growth markets
AVEVA performed well in our target growth

particular success in North America,  
where our local strategy of leading with 
sales to OOs and of MT3D products is 
working well.
