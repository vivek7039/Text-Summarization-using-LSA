 Chairman’s statement
Philip H Swatman
Chairman
“Eddie Stobart is much more 
than a haulage business”
Overview
Having joined the Board as Chairman of  
Eddie Stobart Logistics in April 2017, I’d like  
to take this opportunity to welcome all our new 
shareholders to the business. Notwithstanding 
the changes in ownership in recent years,  
the business has continued to maintain its 
traditional high standards of customer service 
and integrity, as well as develop new service 
offerings and expand in new sectors. 
People and Board
In addition to my appointment, Christopher 
Casey and Stephen Harley joined as  
Non-executive Directors, bringing strong 
financial and operational expertise to the 
Board.
Our Board is compact and the Directors have 
an extensive range of skills. We are able to 
remain tightly focused on the continued 
development of our business, under the 
outstanding leadership of our Chief Executive 
Officer, Alex Laffey. We can also leverage 
opportunities as and when they come, 
responding quickly and efficiently.
I have been particularly impressed by the 
enthusiasm and dedication of all our staff,  
who have been instrumental to ensuring we 
deliver our service promise to customers. 
It is really important to me that all our people 
receive the right training to do their jobs 
effectively. We will continue to invest by offering 
training courses across a range of disciplines, 
allowing employees at all levels to expand their 
knowledge and skills. 
Financial performance
Eddie Stobart performed strongly in 2017, 
achieving significant growth and securing  
a number of new contract wins. We have 
leveraged our warehousing and transportation 
model and completed a number of successful 
acquisitions, all of which adds to our skills and 
capabilities and positions us well across high 
growth markets. 
The core business of transport and logistics 
remains competitive. We pride ourselves on 
differentiating our quality of service levels, 
which is critical to our customers' operations, 
and providing tailored offerings which 
contribute to their efficiency. Our profitability is 
enhanced by industry leading levels of 
utilisation and skilful procurement and 
management of the assets used in our 
business.
Our overall performance in the year gives us 
confidence that we will continue to make 
progress against our growth strategy in the 
year ahead. Continued strong cash generation 
enabled the Group to pay an interim dividend of 
£5.0m (1.4 pence per share) during the year. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
£15.8m (4.4 pence per share), making a total of 
£20.8m, (5.8 pence per share) for the 2016/17 
financial year. 
Outlook
The new financial year has started well  
and in line with the Board’s expectations.  
I am encouraged by our continued strong 
operational and customer performance.  
Based on the performance of the businesses 
we have acquired in 2017 and major contract  
wins, supported by a strong new business 
pipeline, the Board is confident of further 
growth in the year ahead.
In terms of the wider business environment,  
we continue to see encouraging trends in all 
sectors with new and existing customers 
considering outsourcing, so that they can 
concentrate on their core operations and 
customer offerings. We have also seen further 
consolidation in the logistics sector in 2017 and 
early signs indicate that the trend will continue, 
providing further opportunities for growth. 
Whilst our existing business in continental 
Europe is small, we have ambitions to develop 
this, replicating our successful model in the 
UK. We will be keeping the Brexit position 
under review but, to date, we have seen no 
significant impact from Brexit on our business. 
Finally, I would like to thank all employees, 
customers and wider stakeholders for their 
continued support, hard work and valuable 
contribution.
