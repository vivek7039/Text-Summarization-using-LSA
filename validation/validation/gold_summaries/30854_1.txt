Chief Executive’s statement
Meggitt is a leading provider of smart engineering for 
extreme environments. We invest in technologies and 
capabilities that enable our customers to develop 
aircraft, gas turbines and other complex equipment 
that has to perform in challenging conditions.
Over the last few years, investment in our 
portfolio has enabled us to significantly 
increase the number and value of Meggitt 
parts on new platforms that will drive growth 
for decades. We have focused on: improving 
the service we offer to our customers 
including the formation of our Customer 
Services and Support (‘CSS’) organisation; 
enhancing our competitiveness, through 
the deployment of the Meggitt Production 
System (‘MPS’); and building a high 
performance culture, capable of delivering 
superior returns for shareholders over the 
medium term.
Portfolio
In 2017, Meggitt technologies have played a 
critical role in enabling the first flights of new 
aircraft such as the Embraer E2, Comac C919 
and Saab Gripen-E; and the entry into service 
of important new platforms including the 
Boeing 737MAX and Airbus A321neo. Having 
increased our content on these platforms 
compared to their predecessors, these 
milestones represent an important step on 
our journey to increased growth.
To enable us to increase share even further 
on the next generation of aircraft, we have 
continued to prioritise investment in applied 
research and technology, focusing on 
those areas where we expect both market 
demand and our competitive position to be 
strong. One such example is research into 
advanced thermal systems for ultra-high 
bypass engines, where we have secured a UK 
Government grant of £3.7m to build on our 
deep capability in aerospace heat exchangers. 
We have also prioritised investment in 
advanced manufacturing technologies 
such as our Meggitt Modular Modifiable 
Manufacturing (M
4
) initiative and investments 
in additive manufacturing for aerospace 
applications.
To supplement this focus on technologies 
where we have strong competitive positions 
in attractive markets, we announced a series 
of divestments in 2017, which materially 
reduced our exposure to non-core industrial 
markets where the technology requirements, 
route to market and operational dynamics are 
very different to our core aerospace business. 
In June 2017, we completed the sale of Piher 
Sensors & Controls, Piezo Technologies and 
Meggitt Maryland to Amphenol Corporation. In 
November 2017, we reached an agreement to 
sell Thomson Aerospace & Defence to Umbra 
Cuscinetti which is expected to complete 
in March 2018, once customary regulatory 
clearances are received. In January 2018, 
we sold Aviation Mobility to Smart Carte. In 
aggregate, these businesses generated a total 
of £54m of revenue during 2017.
Customers
We continued to enhance our ability to 
support our customers with CSS now in its 
second full year of operation. During 2017, 
CSS has secured a number of new contracts 
to support airlines including Emirates, 
Air France and Vietjet. It has broadened 
partnerships with MRO integrators such 
as Lufthansa Technik. And it has secured a 
series of new distribution agreements with 
providers such as Aviall and Proponent. 
At the same time, we have continued to 
evolve our organisation, moving more 
aftermarket activity into our regional hubs in 
the US, UK and Singapore; and enhancing our 
capabilities in areas such as surplus trading. 
To serve our customers better and accelerate 
growth, we acquired Elite Aerospace in 
March 2017 which, when fully integrated into 
our aftermarket hub in Miami in 2018, will 
extend our capability in repair and overhaul 
of heat transfer, pneumatics and hydraulic 
components for commercial and military 
aircraft. 
Such progress is critical as we continue 
to focus on protecting and growing our 
share of Meggitt spares and repairs whilst 
realising the full value of our significant and 
growing installed base, which we have further 
enhanced during the year with a number of 
new OE contract awards. The most notable 
of these is a dual source contract to provide 
wheels and brakes for the Airbus A321neo.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE StrategIc r ep Ort
This strategically significant contract for 
Meggitt, enables us to further demonstrate 
our capability in the large jet market, after 
the entry into service of the Bombardier 
CSeries in 2016 equipped with our Ebrake
TM 
technology, the industry’s second fully electric 
braking system.
In 2017, we have written off an investment 
of £59.5m following Dassault’s cancellation 
of its Falcon 5X programme due to ongoing 
problems related to its Silvercrest engine. 
Programme cancellations are a rare event in 
the aerospace industry. However, Dassault 
has announced its intention to develop a 
replacement Falcon with an alternative engine 
and we are hopeful we will retain our position 
on the successor aircraft. 
Competitiveness
In 2017, MPS – our global approach to 
continuous improvement – has continued to 
go from strength to strength. It was launched 
in 2013 to create a sustainable quality and 
delivery culture that drives competitive 
advantage beyond our technical expertise and 
enables the Group to deliver a higher rate of 
organic growth over the long term. 
In its fifth year, 12 (of our 48) sites have 
now entered the fourth, or bronze, stage of 
MPS where the focus turns to realising the 
financial benefits from improved productivity 
and lower inventories. In 2017, our focus on 
inventory reduction resulted in inventory 
turns increasing from 2.30 to 2.43 and £16m 
of cash being released from working capital. 
As we continue to move more of our sites into 
and beyond the bronze stage over the coming 
years, we expect MPS to make a material 
contribution to the targets we have set for 
margin improvement and cash generation.
During the year, we secured a number 
of supply agreements for important 
commodities such as electronics, fasteners 
and machining and we have invested in our 
Group purchasing organisation to more 
rapidly deploy these agreements in 2018 to 
leverage economies of scale, aligned to our 
target of achieving a net 2% reduction in 
purchased costs each year.
We have also taken a number of important 
steps to rationalise our footprint by 20% by 
2021. In November 2017, we commenced 
consultation ahead of a proposal to 
consolidate a range of manufacturing, 
engineering and support operations into a 
single centre of excellence at Ansty Park in 
Rugby, UK. This £130m total investment, 
developed in conjunction with partners, will 
see a state of the art manufacturing campus 
become operational by late 2019, serving 
as a hub for next generation innovation and 
acting as a catalyst for world-class operational 
performance.
Moving more work into larger, more 
capable sites is a key component of our 
site rationalisation strategy. It enables us to 
eliminate some of the fixed costs required 
to run individual aerospace sites but also 
provides better leverage of investment in 
world class infrastructure that will increase 
efficiency and improve customer service. 
Culture
In 2017, we launched a culture development 
programme which has now been deployed to 
over 800 of our leaders, aimed at fostering 
more effective collaboration and teamwork 
across the Group and to increase employee 
engagement. Talent has also been a key 
priority during the year, with a number of 
significant new hires during 2017. On the 
Executive Committee alone, four of our 
twelve most senior executives are in new or 
expanded roles and a further three are new to 
Meggitt. 
This focus on talent and culture, together 
with our other key priorities, will enable us 
to accelerate the pace of execution which 
remains critical to delivering growth and 
achieving the medium term targets we have 
outlined for margin improvement and cash 
generation.
Performance
Reported revenue increased by 2% to 
£2,027m, with growth from favourable 
currency translation offset by divestments 
completed within the year. Organic growth 
of 2% was in line with our expectations, 
including civil growth of 4%. Underlying 
earnings per share increased by 1% to 35.3p 
(2016: 34.8p), while net debt to EBITDA at the 
end of the year was 1.9x (2016: 2.1x).
Within civil aerospace, original equipment 
revenue grew organically by 3%, with 
increased shipset content on large jets 
offsetting a decline in regional and business 
jets. Aftermarket revenue increased 
organically by 6%, with strong performance 
in large jets and business aviation offsetting 
a flat performance in regional jets where 
de-stocking in the first six months inhibited 
growth.
Military revenues recovered well in the fourth 
quarter, after some delays to cash flowing 
from increased budgets in the US during the 
first nine months. Organic revenue growth 
of 1%, reflected good demand for original 
equipment, particularly on F-35 offsetting 
lower demand for spares on platforms 
including Typhoon, F-16 and Apache. 
As anticipated, energy revenues continued to 
decline with revenues in the Heatric business 
lower than in 2016, when it completed the 
last of its orders to support large capital 
projects in offshore gas applications. The 
power generation part of our energy business 
also declined as a result of lower demand for 
industrial gas turbines during the year. Overall 
energy revenues declined by 8% organically 
during the year. 
Underlying operating margin increased 
by 10 basis points to 19.2%, with the 
financial benefits from strategic initiatives 
partly offset by headwinds from mix and 
depreciation & amortisation together with 
growth in new product introduction costs at 
Meggitt Polymers & Composites (for more 
information see page 27).
Outlook
The outlook for our civil markets is 
encouraging despite continued delays 
to some civil aircraft programmes. In the 
medium term, production of large jets 
is expected to continue to grow and our 
increased shipsets on the latest generation of 
aircraft supports a positive outlook for civil OE 
revenues. In 2018, we expect civil OE to grow 
organically by 2 to 4%.
Available seat kilometres, an important driver 
of our large jet aftermarket, continue to grow 
well above the long-term trend of 5% per 
annum. This, combined with an improving 
outlook for take-offs and landings of regional 
and business jets and our increased share 
on new generation aircraft, signals that we 
will outgrow the market for civil spares in 
the medium term. In 2018, we expect civil 
aftermarket revenue to grow organically by 
3 to 5%.
In military, a growing defence budget in the 
US combined with good positions on the 
fastest growing and hardest worked aircraft 
platforms, means we are well positioned 
for growth over the medium term. In 2018, 
we anticipate organic growth of 3 to 5% in 
military, underpinned by growth of 4% in 
orders in 2017 (book to bill of 1.08).
In energy, we expect to see some recovery 
after a number of years of declining organic 
revenue driven principally by challenging 
market conditions at the Heatric business. A 
strong fourth quarter at Heatric, which grew 
year on year, for the first time since Q1 2014, 
underpins our expectation of a recovery 
in 2018. With benign conditions in power 
generation and an improving outlook in oil and 
gas markets, we expect our energy revenues 
to grow organically by 0 to 5% in 2018.
On the basis of the above, the Group expects 
overall 2 to 4% organic revenue growth in 
2018, and that this growth momentum will 
accelerate over the medium term. 
Having increased margin by 10 basis points in 
2017, the Group expects further improvement 
driven by the growing momentum in our 
strategic initiatives and is targetting a 10 to 40 
basis point improvement in 2018, before the 
impact of IFRS 15. Under IFRS 15, the Group 
expects a 30 basis point headwind from the 
accelerated growth in free of charge OE parts 
which would equate to a target for 2018 of 
17.7% to 18.0% (compared to 17.9% in 2017 
under IFRS 15).
We estimate free of charge shipsets will add 
an incremental 60 basis points headwind 
to margin between 2017 and 2021 and have 
restated our medium term margin target to 
reflect this change in accounting. We now 
expect to deliver a margin improvement of 
at least 200 basis points by 2021, which is 
consistent with our target to achieve a 200 
to 250 basis point improvement prior to the 
adoption of IFRS 15.
