Group Chief Executive’s business review
More rapid growth 
available via Digital 
Retail and renewed 
impetus for growth from 
the Enterprise business 
is expected to enable 
the Group to meet its 
strategic targets.
Ian Newcombe
Group Chief Executive
The target market for Sanderson products 
and services primarily comprises of ‘SMEs’ 
(‘small and medium-sized enterprises’). The 
Group’s well-developed business model is 
to foster long-term customer relationships 
which result in a high proportion of sales 
arising from pre-contracted recurring 
revenue, complemented by incremental 
sales to its strong, well-established and 
growing customer base. This robust business 
stream usually accounts for around 50% 
of Group revenues. Sanderson proprietary 
software is developed in anticipation of 
technological developments and often in 
conjunction, collaboration and partnership 
with its large customer base. Sanderson 
proprietary software is marketed and sold 
under a ‘right to use’ licence with all sales, 
marketing, delivery, support and services 
being carried out by the Group’s own  
expert staff.
Group business solutions are developed 
and marketed in order to provide customers 
with ‘value for money’ IT systems, designed 
to offer cost effective, timely and tangible 
business benefits. These solutions 
typically enable customers to increase 
revenue whilst also achieving additional 
efficiencies by making and maintaining cost 
savings, both often within twelve months 
of implementation. Such robust and agile 
systems will be key to help customers remain 
competitive in challenging market times.
The Group continues to invest in the 
development of its software products and 
services, as well as in increasing its sales and 
marketing capacity and capability. Particular 
emphasis has been placed on the Group 
businesses specialising in the UK food and 
drink processing and wholesale distribution 
sectors, and especially, in the market for 
digital retail solutions with the continued 
development of mobile and ecommerce 
solutions. These solutions enable retailers 
to capitalise on the significant growth 
opportunities arising from the widespread 
adoption of smartphones and tablets and 
to exploit ‘mobile’ as a sales channel that 
is becoming fully integrated with existing 
business systems.
At the core of the Group’s well-developed 
business model is Sanderson proprietary 
software with both on-premise, as well as, 
cloud-based solutions being offered to 
customers on an ongoing annual contractual 
basis, together with the accompanying 
consultancy, support and maintenance 
services. In the year ended 30 September 
2017, these pre-contracted recurring 
revenues amounted to £11.18 million 
(2016: £10.75 million) representing 52% 
of total revenues (2016: 50%). The gross 
margin from recurring revenues covered 
67% of total Group overheads in the financial 
year (2016: 63%). 
Reflecting both prior and continuing 
investment in the Group’s sales and 
marketing function, Sanderson continued 
to achieve a significantly improved level 
of order intake during the year, up 12% to 
£13.69 million compared with £12.26 million 
in the prior year. During the year, thirteen 
new customers contributed orders to the 
value of £1.60 million (2016: 22 new 
customers generated orders to the value of 
£3.83 million). The financial year ending 
30 September 2016 had been exceptional 
in terms of new sales orders from new 
customers. New customer orders for the 
financial year ending 30 September 2017 
are ‘in line’ with the longer term, four-year 
average. The development of opportunities 
from new customers and prospects remains 
a key focus for the business.
Review of Digital Retail
Sanderson provides comprehensive IT 
solutions to businesses operating in the 
ecommerce, mobile commerce and retail 
sectors of the UK. Mobile solutions, in-store 
technology and the ‘digital experience’ 
continue to be key business drivers in this 
very active and rapidly developing market.
The Digital Retail Division, which works 
with leading retailers such as JD Sports 
and Superdry, continued to make good 
progress, achieving double digit revenue 
growth of 13.8% to £7.28 million (2016: 
£6.40 million). Operating profits grew 
by a third to £1.18 million (adjusted 
for amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles, share-based payment charges 
and one-off non-recurring items) (2016: 
£0.89 million). The Group continues to 
invest in product innovation and delivery 
capacity in order to address this rapidly 
expanding market. The leadership team was 
further strengthened during the year and 
the business undertook a consolidation to a 
single location in order to generate additional 
efficiencies going forward.
We previously reported that a large new retail 
customer had been gained towards the end 
of the financial year ended 30 September 
2016. This was the very highly rated home 
entertainment retailer, Richer Sounds, 
confirmed by the ‘Which?’ organisation as 
the ‘Best High Street Shop 2017’. With 
a high level of effort and teamwork, both 
from the excellent Richer Sounds team,

Group Chief Executive’s business review  
continued
Digital Retail is continuing to experience increased levels of sales activity
as well as from our own support team, 
the Sanderson solution was successfully 
installed and implemented, ‘on time’ and 
‘on budget’, during the financial year ending 
30 September 2017. Large orders from 
existing customers included Axminster Tool 
Centre Limited, The Savile Row Company 
and QUIZ plc.
Digital Retail is continuing to experience 
increased levels of sales activity. A significant 
order was received from an existing 
customer which is scheduled to be delivered 
over the course of the next two financial 
years. In addition, following receipt of an 
initial order worth over £200,000 from a 
leading global fashion brand, a large pilot 
scheme is now underway with this  
new customer.
The year-end order book was £3.99 million 
(2016: £0.92 million) and included the 
large order, to be delivered over the next two 
years, which is mentioned above. With a 
number of developing sales prospects, active 
pilot projects and strengthening partnerships 
with existing customers, the Digital Retail 
business is well-positioned to take advantage 
of the growth in this market.
Review of Enterprise 
The Enterprise Division of Sanderson 
comprises two market-focused businesses 
which operate in the manufacturing and 
in the wholesale, distribution and logistics 
sectors. The Enterprise Division has 
achieved a solid trading performance. 
Sales prospects are good but sales cycles 
have been protracted with the timing of the 
receipt of sales orders, as ever, being critical 
to business performance. We have not yet 
perceived any market effect which might 
be caused by any uncertainty relating to 
Brexit. A restructure and strengthening of 
management took place across the Division 
and this should improve the prospects for the 
Group’s Enterprise businesses in the future. 
Divisional revenue was £14.28 million (2016: 
£14.92 million) following an exceptional 
performance in the prior financial year. 
Operating profit (adjusted for amortisation 
of acquisition-related intangibles, share-
based payment charges and one-off non-
recurring items) was £2.71 million (2016: 
£2.80 million). The Group continues to invest 
in product development and in its sales and 
marketing capability. The Enterprise Division 
optimised delivery during the year, reflected 
in the order book which, at the financial 
year-end, was valued at £1.81 million (2016: 
£2.10 million). 
Enterprise – Manufacturing
Businesses in the engineering, plastics, 
aerospace, electronics, print (‘general 
manufacturing’) and food and drink 
processing sectors, represent the main 
areas of specialisation for Sanderson in 
manufacturing markets. The Group’s 
manufacturing business is very much driven 
by activity in the food and drink industry, 
with the Sanderson business addressing 
this sector, outperforming market growth. 
Traceability of ingredients through the 
supply chain and compliance with the latest 
regulatory standards are key requirements 
for food and drink businesses and are strong 
features of the Group’s solution. Overall, 
the manufacturing business gained six new 
customers during the year (2016: seven), 
including Tomlinson’s Dairies and Ragus 
Sugars Limited, with large orders from 
existing customers including The Burger 
Manufacturing Company Limited.

Enterprise – Wholesale 
Distribution and Logistics
Sanderson activities in wholesale distribution 
and logistics are now extended into the 
specialist warehousing, logistics and 
supply chain markets which augment the 
solutions provided to the wholesale, cash 
and carry and fulfilment sectors. Six new 
customers were gained during the year, at 
an average initial order value of £89,000 
(2016: £160,000) and this compares with 
thirteen new customers in the prior year. 
Across the Division, sales prospects are 
strong and ahead of this time last year. A 
large order gained in the prior financial 
year, was successfully delivered during 
the period to DPD, one of the UK’s leading 
delivery and distribution businesses. 
Major sales orders were gained from a 
number of existing customers including 
Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and the 
Kitwave Wholesale Group. During the year, 
the Group has invested in some post-
acquisition restructuring and has built a 
new management team in the specialist 
warehousing and logistics business. 
Improved levels of growth and profit are  
now anticipated. 
Following the theme of increased digital 
transformation in the retail market, the 
Sanderson business operating in the 
wholesale distribution and cash and carry 
sector, has further invested in software 
development, recently launching a new suite 
of digital solutions which further capitalise 
on the growing use of mobile devices. 
Product innovation, together with the Group’s 
track record in the wholesale industry, 
positions the business well for further 
growth in the coming financial year ending 
30 September 2018.
Outlook
The Board has an ongoing business plan 
which is to accelerate the Group’s growth 
and development both organically as well 
as by making selective acquisitions in 
order to further increase profitability and 
dividends, thereby enhancing shareholder 
value. The acquisition of Anisa is the result 
of considerable work from both the Anisa 
and Sanderson management teams and 
provides the Group with an enlarged and 
stronger platform from which to operate. 
Further acquisitions are being considered 
and developed.
The Board will continue to invest in its 
digital retail solutions and in its enterprise 
software businesses in order to ensure that 
product offerings continue to both attract 
new customers, as well as to maximise and 
to encourage additional investment in system 
enhancements and new technological 
developments from existing customers. The 
combination of more rapid growth available 
via the Digital Retail Division and renewed 
impetus for growth from the Enterprise 
business, is expected to enable the Group to 
meet its strategic targets over the course of 
the coming years. 
Whilst the Group has not yet detected any 
major loss of confidence from either existing 
or prospective customers, the Board and 
senior management continue to carefully 
monitor market conditions, customer 
confidence, as well as the development of 
sales prospects and the progression of these 
sales prospects into customers.
Sanderson has maintained a strong balance 
sheet, resulting from a robust business 
model which is built upon long-term 
customer relationships, thereby generating 
strong recurring revenues. The Board 
believes that the Group, which now includes 
the Anisa business, is well positioned in its 
target markets. A healthy order book and 
good sales prospects provide the Board 
with a good level of confidence that, at this 
relatively early stage of the new financial 
year, the Group will make further progress 
and deliver trading results which are, at 
least, in line with market expectations for the 
year ending 30 September 2018.
