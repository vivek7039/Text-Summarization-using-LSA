 Further enhance  
our differentiated  
food proposition
Priority #1
Food will always be at the 
heart of our business. 
We have a strong and differentiated food 
proposition that offers customers market-
leading quality, choice and value. We have 
now completed our 3,000 Sainsbury’s 
own-brand product quality investment 
programme and will continue to make 
quality improvements where they matter 
most to our customers. Over the course of 
the next year, we will review 125 food ranges, 
touching around 60 per cent of our food 
sales. Customers continue to rank us ahead 
of our supermarket peers for food quality

Great quality at fair prices
Our Food business is resilient. While the 
grocery retailing market remains competitive, 
investment in the quality and price of our 
core by Sainsbury’s range delivered volume 
growth of two per cent. Our strategic focus is 
on growing categories where we can increase 
market share such as Deliciously FreeFrom, 
our new On the Go range and prepared 
vegetables. In September, we launched our 
On the Go range of breakfast, lunch and 
snacking lines. It is a market worth around 
£16 billion and we invested £8 million in our 
range, introducing new sandwich and bread 
options, salads and sushi. We also increased 
the number of breakfast and snacking options 
on offer, as well as improving existing lines. 
Snacking, in particular, has performed well.
The successful launch of our Deliciously 
FreeFrom range reflected the increasing 
importance of allergen-free food to our 
customers. Around 25 per cent of the UK 
population includes free from products in 
their weekly shop
2
. We have doubled the 
new range, incorporating fresh, frozen, 
chilled and ambient lines, offering customers 
more variety, improved products and 
market-leading allergen information on 
the packaging. We also became the only 
supermarket to offer gluten-free bread 
freshly baked in our store bakeries. The range 
has proved very popular and we sell nearly 
12,000 loaves a week. 
Our innovative prepared vegetable range has 
been a great success with customers who 
are increasingly looking for filling, healthy 
alternatives to carbohydrates and want to 
introduce more vegetables in to their diet. 
We responded to last year’s demand for 
courgetti (courgette spaghetti) and boodles 
(butternut squash noodles) by introducing 
eight more prepared vegetable lines this 
year, including first-to-market vegetable 
lasagne sheets and butternut squash waffles. 
These innovative new lines have helped drive 
double-digit year-on-year growth for the 
prepared vegetables category.
We continue to develop our overall food 
offer to ensure customers can buy great 
quality food at Sainsbury’s for different 
shopping missions. Our in-store sushi 
concessions are all performing well and offer 
customers something new to try when they 
visit our stores. 
As a major retailer, in a highly competitive 
industry, our values make us different and 
make strong commercial sense. Our values 
help us strengthen relationships with all our 
stakeholders, build trust, reduce operating 
costs, mitigate risks and attract and retain 
talent in a crowded marketplace. Our values 
also enable us to play a leading role in tackling 
some of the challenges facing our customers 
every day such as household food waste.
To help our customers live healthier lives we 
have reduced the sugar in our cereal range 
by an average of 13 per cent, exceeding the 
Government’s 2017 targets of a five per cent 
reduction. We also removed more than three 
tonnes of salt from our canned corned beef 
products without impacting taste or flavour. 
All our products are sourced with integrity 
and this year we were proud to be named 
the World’s Best Sustainable Seafood 
Supermarket by the Marine Stewardship 
Council. We sold over £490 million of RSPCA-
assured products this year and worked with 
our Dairy Development Group to reduce the 
need for certain classes of antibiotics, leading 
to a voluntary withdrawal.

Product quality
We know customers value quality when 
deciding where to shop and it is therefore 
important for us to be ranked above our 
peers in relation to the quality perception of 
our brand.
Definition: Our rank is based on a sample of 
approximately 1,000 consumers who rated 
the product quality of Sainsbury’s, Tesco, 
Morrisons and Asda.

Sales growth – Food
Food is our core business but growing 
our Clothing, General Merchandising and 
Financial Services businesses is an important 
part of our strategy. We know that our 
customers value greater choice and that 
there is a firm correlation between increased 
loyalty and spend across our whole offer 
when customers buy into these categories.

including VAT.

 15 Strategic Report Sales in our Groceries Online channel grew by 
over eight per cent and orders increased by 
nearly 12 per cent during the year. We deliver 
around 276,000 orders per week. We expect 
that demand for our online grocery service 
in London will double over the next eight 
years and to help meet that growing demand 
we opened our first purpose-built online 
fulfilment centre in Bromley-by-Bow, East 
London. With its cutting-edge technology, 
it has the capacity to fulfil 25,000 customer 
orders each week. We now have 151 Groceries 
Online Click & Collect sites and a growing 
number of our customers place their order 
online and collect their shopping at their local 
supermarket. To add to customer choice, we 
offer same-day delivery from 29 stores across 
the UK and are trialling one hour delivery 
to over 40,000 London postcodes through 
our Chop Chop bicycle delivery service. We 
introduced our Groceries Online app in 2016 
to give customers more ways to shop with 
us. Penetration is steadily increasing, with 
over ten per cent of orders received through 
the app, demonstrating the rapidly changing 
nature of customer shopping behaviour. 
Leading customer service
Our colleagues continue to deliver market-
leading customer service and we won 17 
weekly Grocer 33 Awards this year
4
. In 
addition, for the past four years we have 
won the Grocer Gold Awards for Service and 
Availability and we continue to exceed our 
Mystery Shopper internal targets.
3  The number of convenience stores stated includes our 
partnership with Euro Garages.
4 Grocer 33 for 52 weeks to 11 March.
Demonstrating our respect for our 
environment we now use nearly 12 per cent 
less electricity than we did in 2005, despite 
growing store space by over 54 per cent. 
Also since 2005, we have reduced packaging 
across Sainsbury’s branded ranges by almost 
33 per cent and we continue to work towards 
our target of a 50 per cent reduction by 2020. 
This year marked a significant milestone 
on food waste, as we moved to transparent 
reporting – one of only two major retailers 
to do so and we have set a clear benchmark 
against which we can measure progress. We 
completed a trial of Waste less, Save more, 
our five-year initiative to help our customers 
tackle household food waste in Swadlincote, 
Derbyshire, with 20 intervention trials. 
These trials ranged from apps to weigh and 
report on food waste to pioneering school 
programmes to engage young people on 
the issue.
In addition to providing excellent customer 
service, our colleagues are committed to 
making a positive difference to our 
community. In 2016/17, we generated over 
£53 million for charities through the efforts of 
our colleagues and customers. This includes 
nearly £12 million raised through our support 
of Comic Relief’s Red Nose Day.
We aim to be a company where people 
love to work and our colleagues are integral 
to the success of our business. We offer a 
competitive rewards package, including paid 
breaks, colleague discount and pension. This 
year, colleagues across the Group will share 
a bonus of £78 million. 
Serving customers whenever 
and wherever they want
A key part of our strategy is to be available to 
our customers whenever and wherever they 
want to shop with us. As at the end of this 
financial year we have 605 supermarkets and 
806 convenience stores
3
. Supermarket sales 
declined nearly two per cent and sales at our 
convenience stores grew by over six per cent. 
Supermarkets continue to be the main 
grocery shopping channel, responsible for 
over half of the grocery spend in the UK, and 
we expect this to remain the case. We are 
adapting our space and layouts to reflect 
customer requirements for convenience, 
flexibility, speed and choice. Supermarket 
shoppers can take advantage of extensive 
food ranges, Grocery Click & Collect services 
and in-store cafes and restaurants.
Our Convenience business grew by over 
six per cent and we opened 41 new shops 
including trials of seven franchises in Euro 
Garages’ petrol station forecourts.
Sales growth
Customers are choosing to shop across 
channels and are using convenience 
and online more frequently, leading to a 
decline in supermarket sales. It is therefore 
important that we invest strategically so 
that we can serve our customers whenever, 
however and wherever they want.
Definition: Year-on-year growth of total sales, 
including VAT, excluding fuel.
