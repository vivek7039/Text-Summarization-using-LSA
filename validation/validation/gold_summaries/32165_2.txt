Dairy Crest produces and markets Cathedral City, the UK’s leading 
cheese brand, and the premium Davidstow cheddar brand. Our 
world-class supply chain starts with milk supplied by 360 farmers in 
the dairying heartlands of Cornwall and Devon. This top quality milk 
is made into cheddar cheese at our highly-automated creamery 
in Davidstow, Cornwall. The cheese then matures for on average 
nearly a year at our purpose-built Nuneaton facility before being cut, 
packed and distributed. We have a second packing site in Frome, 
Somerset, for more complex and innovative packaging.
 Whey is a by-product of the cheese making process. Our  
new facility at Davidstow produces demineralised whey and 
galacto-oligosaccharide (‘GOS’), a lactose based prebiotic, which 
are both ingredients for infant formula, a high-growth, high-margin 
global market.
 Highlights

Cathedral City is Britain’s largest cheese brand, 18th largest 
grocery brand and 7th largest online grocery brand
•	
Cathedral City is now bought by nearly 55% of UK households 
each year
•	
Cathedral City has been re-launched with new and improved 
packaging design across the range
•	
100% of our milk comes from dedicated farmers in the South 
West of England

& oil brands in the UK. Key brands include Country Life (butter)

 Our subsidiary company, MH Foods, is based in Erith, Kent
