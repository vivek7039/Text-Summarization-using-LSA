 − Arbitrage/mispricing U+I is a specialist mixed-use regeneration developer and 
investor. We realise gains and drive value as we unlock the 
potential of land and assets. 
We have a talent for buying well and delivering value through 
planning and development. We focus on opportunities where 
our size and expertise afford us competitive advantage. We 
are experts in managing the complexities of the planning system 
to deliver high quality, mixed-use regeneration projects. 
With a track record of over 25 years of investment and 
development, and a diverse team of property experts, our  
£6 billion portfolio contains a mixture of longer-term large-
scale regeneration projects, shorter-term trading 
opportunities and investment assets (see pages 22 to 39). 
This combination of projects allows us to generate consistent 
returns and income through the property cycles. 
We have an equity-efficient approach to development, whereby 
we limit our financial exposure through the Public Private  
Partnership (PPP) model (see pages 28 to 31). This reduces 
our risk exposure in any one individual project whilst allowing 
us to build a portfolio with significant upside potential.
Our activity is focused on three core geographical areas – the 
London City Region*, Manchester and Dublin – where we 
see liquidity and sufficient depth through the cycle as well as 
growth in demand. These locations have the talent, tenants 
and tourism to succeed. 
Placing people at the heart of everything we do, we are 
committed to delivering profitable projects that create a legacy 
and deliver socio-economic change for the communities in 
which we work (see pages 48 to 54).
