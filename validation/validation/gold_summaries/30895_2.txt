An unrivalled portfolio
Through our best in class networks we help our customers to communicate where 
terrestrial telecom networks lack reliability or coverage; on land, at sea or in the air.
Global Xpress – the first  
global, high bandwidth  
satellite network  
 
GX, based on our four Inmarsat-5 satellites 
currently in orbit, is a global, mobile, high 
bandwidth network, which will be further 
augmented by new, low-cost technologies 
in the future. The GX network is fully 
operational, following the launch of 
the fourth I-5 satellite in 2017.
The European Aviation  
Network – a unique asset  
 
 
The integrated S-band satellite and 
air-to-ground network, the EAN, will be 
a compelling and unique proposition for 
commercial aviation customers in Europe, 
compared to other satellite-only offerings. 
The network delivers higher capacity, wider 
coverage, superior cost per bit, faster speeds 
and lower latency, with smaller and lighter 
equipment which can be installed quickly, 
more cost effectively and with less fuel drag.
High-performance  
mobility-designed L -band 
satellites – supported by secure 
networks and technology  
Our L -band networks, through eight 
Inmarsat-3 and Inmarsat-4 satellites, have 
helped Inmarsat to establish and develop 
a loyal customer and distribution base 
over time. The Inmarsat-6 satellites comprise 
two dual payload (L -band and Ka-band) 
satellites due to be launched at the start of the 
next decade. This will ensure the reorientation 
of our L -band capabilities towards new growth 
opportunities uniquely addressable by a 
cutting edge global network, with a small, 
low-cost, highly reliable and agile device 
to deliver our services to end users.
