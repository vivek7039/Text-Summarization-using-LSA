approaches all focused on contracted 
wholesale power generation across 
different technologies and geographies:

Brazil windfarm consolidation
ADJ EBITDA: ALREADY FULLY CONSOLIDATED IN PREVIOUS YEARS
4
In December 2017 we reached an agreement with the project’s 
minority shareholder to acquire its shares in Chapada I and Chapada II 
projects. The activity in the first half of 2018 will consist of closing the 
remaining conditions precedent to the transfer of shares. 
In 2017
Spanish 
CSP portfolio
ADJ. EBITDA: $130M
5
On 27th February 2018 we reached 
an agreement to acquire Acciona 
Energia’s 250 MW portfolio of five 
operating 50 MW Concentrated Solar 
Power (CSP) plants in south-west 
Spain. This will further increase our 
revenues from investment grade 
rated countries.
2
Hydro and cogeneration 
acquisition in Brazil
ADJ. EBITDA: $42M
1
In March 2017 we closed the acquisition of 
206 MW operational portfolio – composed 
of 130 MW of hydro assets and 76 MW of 
cogeneration assets.
The cogeneration contracts are capacity-based, 
mostly denominated in US dollars and have a 
largely US dollar-denominated return. They are 
the type of contracts with commercial and 
industrial customers that our Solutions business 
pursue. The hydro PPAs are inside a regulated 
Brazilian hydrology protection scheme, which 
reduces individual hydro plant performance risk.
We will benefit from our experience in operating 
hydro and cogeneration plants and from our 
Brazilian platform to improve the operational 
performance of the assets and realize 
various synergies.
Kosovo
ADJ EBITDA: €250M  
(ON THE FIRST FULL YEAR  
OF OPERATIONS)
In December 2017, we have signed 
the commercial contracts with the 
Kosovo Government to build a new 
single unit lignite-fired power plant 
with a gross capacity of 500 MW, 
located in Obiliq, Kosovo. Total costs 
for the Kosovo Project are estimated 
to reach approximately €1.3bn. The 
power plant is expected to start 
operations in 2023 and will have 
a life expectancy of four decades. 
The activities in 2018 will be focused 
on the financing arrangements of 
the project with the aim to start 
construction activities in 2019.

Italy solar 
photovoltaic roll up
ADJ. EBITDA: €15M
3
We have been following a roll-up strategy to 
acquire mid-sized solar photovoltaic portfolios 
in Italy, a market that remains fragmented with 
many opportunities. Our operational strategy is 
to insource operation and maintenance during 
integration, reducing costs and improving the 
assets’ operational performance. 
In 2017 we closed a total of 19 MW and signed 
an additional 23 MW. The assets are mainly 
composed of solar photovoltaic plants located in 
Italy with geographical proximity to our existing 
solar photovoltaic assets. They also include one 
solar photovoltaic plant in Romania (7 MW) and 
two biogas plants in Italy (2 MW).

Greenfield development
Opportunistic development taking advantage of cyclical under 
supply of capital combined with development expertize to 
create opportunities for higher return.
2
Greenfield acquisitions
Purchasing assets without existing contracts, subject to the 
ability to put contracts in place. Involves similar, customized 
contractual risk profiles to our development assets but have 
the benefit of an operating history.
3
Strategic acquisitions
Purchasing assets with existing contracts where we have both:
(i)  a clear competitive advantage due to asset size, technology, 
asset diversity or complexity of process or market; and
(ii) an ability to improve operations.
4
Development in partnership projects
Developing projects with customized contracts in partnership 
with governments, utilities and corporations. These are in 
regions where there is need for reliable power infrastructure 
but insufficient capital and expertize.
5
Platform expansions
Developing expansions of existing projects leverages existing 
relationships with governments, offtakers, lenders and suppliers, 
replicating the same technology and structure. Platform 
expansions are typically low risk and high return, given the 
expertize already acquired and the synergies and cost 
reductions achieved by expanding the platform.
18 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 19 KPIs
We measure our progress against seven financial 
and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs).
Income from Operations ($m)
Adjusted EBITDA ($m)
Funds from Operations ($m)
Equivalent Forced  
Outage Rate (%)
Net Leverage ratio
1
 (×)
 
Income From Operations (IFO) is 
derived from the IFRS consolidated 
statement of income and corresponds 
to the sum of the following line items: 
Revenue, Cost of sales, Selling, 
general and administrative expenses, 
Other operating income – net and 
acquisition related items. This is a 
measure of profitability that includes 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
as well as development costs.
In 2017, IFO grew significantly from 
$221.8m in 2016 to $269.0m (+21%), 
reflecting the successful integration of 
new assets (acquired or which entered 
into operations) and close fixed costs 
monitoring during the period.
The Equivalent Forced Outage Rate 
(EFOR) is the ratio between hours of 
unit failure given as a percentage of 
the total hours in a set period.
Like the AF, the EFOR is widely used 
in the industry to measure technical 
performance.
Consistent strong downwards trend 
of forced outages rate in the last three 
years, reflecting improving operational 
performance results.
Adjusted EBITDA is the combined 
profit from continuing operations for 
all controlled assets before income 
taxes, net finance costs, depreciation 
and amortization, acquisition-related 
expenses and specific items adjusted 
for their size, nature or incidence, 
less ContourGlobal’s share of the 
profit from unconsolidated entities 
accounted for the equity method, 
plus the Company’s pro-rata portion 
of Adjusted EBITDA for such entities.
This is the key measure of the 
Company’s profitability.
In 2017, we achieved a significant 
improvement in Adjusted EBITDA. 
It rose by 17% from $440m in 2016 to 
$513m in 2017 thanks to operational 
and growth performances.
Funds From Operations is the 
cash flow from operating activities, 
excluding changes in working capital, 
less interest paid, maintenance 
capital expenditure and distribution 
to minorities.
This is the key measure of the 
Company’s strength of cash flow.
Strong operational performance and 
highly contracted cash flows allowed 
us to maintain and even improve the 
Group’s cash conversion.
The Company leverage ratio is 
measured as total net indebtedness 
(reported as the difference between 
Borrowings and Cash and Cash 
Equivalent under the IFRS statement of 
financial position) to Adjusted EBITDA.
This is the key credit measure of 
the Company.
The Company aims to maintain its 
leverage ratio on the long-term in 
a range from 4.0x to 4.5x. The 2017 
leverage ratio reached 4.1x 
compared to 4.8x in 2016.

Availability Factor (%)
The Availability Factor (AF) is the 
percentage of time a power plant was 
available to generate electricity over a  
set time period.
It is widely used in the industry to 
track the technical performance of 
power plants and for benchmarking. 
We use it as a primary KPI for 
our assets.
Good and consistent performance 
results, in line with benchmarked top 
decile peers.

Lost Time Incident Rate (%)
The Lost Time Incident (LTI) Rate 
shows the recordable lost time 
injuries per labor hours so they can 
be compared across any industry. 
The chart presents our performance 
over the past years.
This is the key measure for our 
Health and Safety performance.
Our LTI rate of 0.03 for 2017 was 
the lowest value achieved since we 
started recording data. It is a 50% 
reduction on 2016.
