 Chief Executive’ s Review
We continue to roll out our model, which is designed to address  
fundamental market drivers and to be resilient in the face of  
current regulatory uncertainty.
HIGHLIGHTS
The last year saw the achievement of two related 
milestones for Plutus Powergen. Our first site 
- Attune Energy in Plymouth – came online in 
November 2016 and, as a result of meeting the three 
Triad periods, the site was profitable over the small 
number of hours it generated. Secondly, as a result 
of securing access to planning for the Rockpool 
sites, the Company was pleased to be able to 
report achieving our maiden trading profit before 
development site write offs at the year end.
We have made good progress with the installation 
of power generation projects, and will have 6 
operational facilities representing 120MW of capacity 
by the end of 2017. We have the remaining three 
Rockpool sites with planning and anticipate having 
these built in time for next winter. 
Further sites will be based on gas powered engines 
(see Strategy, below). We have submitted planning 
applications for 80MW of gas capacity, and have a 
total pipeline of gas, (mains and LNG), and battery 
sites of 700MW.
In last December’s capacity auction, we were 
awarded Capacity Mechanism contracts for three 
20MW sites and have entered a further eight sites 
for the next auction in February 2018.
MARKET CONTEXT
There remains regulatory uncertainty in the market. 
In March 2017, Ofgem published a ‘minded to’ 
decision, which it confirmed recently. From the 
winter of 2020/21, this would reduce the embedded 
benefits received by distribution connected 
generators such as PPG to the residual charge. 
While this change settles down, there is concern 
among industry participants that price volatility will 
increase, which in turn will lead to higher energy 
prices. Additionally, third party analysis indicates  
that generators generating for the Triad market  
have acted to depress volatility over the winter –  
or peak demand – months. The effect of increased 
volatility over the winter months, when demand is 
high, increases the risk that energy prices will spike.  
While there is a price cap of £1,500/MWh, there are 
plans in place for this to be raised to £3,000 initially 
and then to £6,000 per MWh. This cost must either 
be absorbed by suppliers or passed on to  
the consumer, but we may be able to benefit  
from such spikes.
Despite Ofgem’s decision, our returns are still 
anticipated to be at or above our base case 
projections. Any loss of Triad income is expected to 
be offset by firmer prices in the balancing markets 
as National Grid seeks to physically balance the grid 
and the market for flexible power as suppliers seek 
to balance their retail power books and mitigate 
energy price volatility.
The outcome of DEFRA’s consultation on lower 
emissions limits was delayed by the general election 
until just recently, but we are confident of being able 
to comply with the proposed new rules without any 
material impact on investor returns. The proposed 
outcomes in relation to the transposition into UK 
law of the Medium Combustion Plant Directive 
(MCPD) will require us to fit selective catalytic 
reduction (SCR) or other measures to reduce the 
NOx from our green fuel fleet, but the cost of this 
is manageable. We continue to monitor and be 
involved in the consultation process.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 National Grid launched a review in June of all 
markets which seeks to make the balancing markets 
in which we compete more dynamic and closer to 
real-time. Over the next 18 months National Grid 
plans to rationalise the number of markets they 
operate for balancing, and also be more transparent 
with the data and the way that they balance. They 
also want to make the markets more real time: a 
day ahead FFR market and STOR, and an in-day 
trading market around frequency response. They 
are consulting about shifting the market away from 
auctions to a traded market, to trade capacity in the 
same way as the market trades electrons. These 
changes will cement the role of local, reliable, flexible 
generation in the UK energy mix.
Notwithstanding this uncertainty and likely changes 
to the way that value will be distributed in the 
market, the fundamental drivers remain the same. 
Insufficient base load power generation capacity 
is being installed. No large gas power stations are 
being built, and still no nuclear, yet demand for 
energy is increasing and becoming more reliant 
on renewable sources to meet it. The proposed 
withdrawal of new petrol and diesel cars from the 
roads by 2040 will further increase demand for 
power for charging electric vehicles.
A key indicator of the importance of flexible 
generation is that energy suppliers are finding 
ever more inventive ways to access that capacity.  
These solutions range from innovative procurement 
arrangements, through to co-investment.  
Additionally, some suppliers are starting to develop 
innovative solutions, such as using existing energy 
market contracts to hypothecate or match up 
demand and supply, so consumers can be more 
certain of the price in a highly volatile market. This 
is a good thing for big power consumers or local 
communities that are a little off grid or can organise 
to capitalise on such opportunities, but the net effect 
is that the remaining market may become even more 
volatile, resulting in further separation between the 
energy rich and energy poor. 
OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
Our original objective was to have 200MW of 
generating capacity within three years. By the end 
of this calendar year we will have 120MW installed 
and operational, and the remaining three renewable 
diesel sites operational in time for next winter. This 
means we will have achieved 180MW of renewable 
diesel sites – or 90% of our target – after four  
years, through some very challenging times from  
a regulatory and financing perspective.
Our most significant strategic shift is our decision 
to diversify into gas powered engines. We started 
this process in the new year, and now have 80MW 
of projects in planning and a further 120MW in the 
pre-planning stage. This means that we are aiming 
for around 200MW of gas-fired generation over the 
next two to three years, and we continue develop 
our overall pipeline of 700MW further.
There are several factors that favour gas for use in 
flexible generation: 
• More hours of running
• Lower levels of pollution, in terms of NOx, CO
2
 
and CO, and SOx;
• Negligible soot and particulate emissions, and no 
smoke or odour in exhaust gases;
• Similar levels of efficiency as green fuel engines;
• Greater reliability, allowing higher maintenance 
intervals and thus reducing costs as well as 
waste oil;
• Reduced noise and vibration;
• The ability to operate on a wide range of gaseous 
fuels, from mains gas and LNG through to 
digester gas derived from the anaerobic digestion 
of sewage and other organic wastes.
Each gas powered site, which will take approximately 
eight months to construct, is anticipated to generate 
an EBITDA of up to £3m per year when Capacity 
Mechanism payments commence.
OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Chief Executive’s Review continued
With gas engines, the economics are such that they 
are able to run merchant to take advantage of peak 
prices as well as assist suppliers in managing volatility 
in their retail power books. Looking back over history, 
peak energy prices suggest these facilities would 
need to run in the range of 1200-1400 hours per 
year. Since volatility drives peak energy prices, these 
numbers may well increase.  
We are beginning to look at hybrid technologies 
whereby both the gas and green fuel sites would 
be fitted with a storage (or exhaustible) capability, 
such as batteries. Combining firm and exhaustible 
generation on the same site allows us to compete 
in more real-time markets, which is the strategic 
direction in which National Grid is consulting to 
implement these markets. We will be piloting these 
technologies on our sites once we have established 
the economic and technical cases.
SolarFlex, which seeks to co-locate firm generation 
and intermittent generation sources, and investigate 
installing exhaustible generation to build ‘real-world’ 
operational data sets, remains part of our strategy 
however has been slower to come to fruition as 
prospective partners have not yet decided their 
preferred approach. We continue to explore this 
approach and remain confident we can demonstrate 
the value to solar operators as our hybrid sites 
establish themselves.
OUTLOOK 
We have a healthy pipeline, and will continue to 
progress with our strategy to develop, build, own 
and operate flexible generation capacity. The 
renewable green diesel sites for Rockpool are 
secured, with five to be connected by the end of 
the year and the remaining three by the end of next. 
We are beginning our gas journey with 80MW in 
planning with the aim to meet our initial target of 
200MW. Although we are closing the chapter on 
renewable diesel fuel, we will seek to make those 
assets more valuable by retrofitting appropriate 
storage technology as it becomes economic. 
Despite some regulatory question marks, we remain 
confident that our FlexGen model is a key part of the 
solution to the challenges ahead as a result of the 
structural changes to the UK’s energy mix.
