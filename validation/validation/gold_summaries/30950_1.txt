10 GYG plc
I am pleased to report on GYG’s first year end results as a public limited 
company. Our successful IPO in July 2017 was a major milestone for the 
Group, further strengthening its position as the global market leader in the 
superyacht painting, supply and maintenance sector. Together with the 
acquisition of the majority shareholding in ACA Marine, GYG’s flotation on 
AIM represented a significant achievement for the Board of our Company 
and I am grateful for the dedicated support of my fellow Directors.
The Group delivered strong results with revenue of ¤62.6m  
in the year ended 31 December 2017 reflecting a 14.7% increase 
compared to FY16, and adjusted EBITDA of ¤7.2m (FY16: 
¤6.7m), an increase of 7.6%. We ended the year with cash of 
¤6.2m on a par with the previous year and a stronger balance 
sheet, having repaid ¤4.3m of loan notes post the IPO.  
This was achieved alongside a busy corporate agenda and 
challenging market conditions in the latter half of the year. 
Strong revenue growth was achieved in the first half, however 
as previously announced, the third quarter refit programme 
was affected by the disruption to seasonal cruising patterns 
from an extraordinary sequence of hurricanes. This caused 
delays to several major projects, leading to a softening of 
revenues in the second half of the year. Despite this, I am 
pleased to report that refit showed a strong recovery in the 
fourth quarter and as far as we can see these project deferrals 
resulted in work being postponed into 2018. The Group is well 
positioned with a strong forward Order Book in a market 
segment which continues to exhibit solid growth.
STRATEGY
The Group’s strategy remains the same as that detailed in our 
Admission Document and we will continue to leverage our 
market leadership in the refit sector where GYG holds a 30% 
share (up from 29% at the time of flotation), an 86% customer 
retention rate, and a preferred supplier status with many of the 
leading refit shipyards in the core locations. Our addressable 
coating market is forecast to grow at 6% per annum and we 
have the platform in place to grow with and above the market. 
The Group is targeting regional developments in the refit 
market by continuing to engage and enter into new agreements 
with shipyards, further strengthening our market position. 
The Group aims to increase its market share in new build 
through an organic growth strategy. The Board believes that 
being a listed group provides reassurance to shipyards due  
to the scale and security of the Group and provides confidence 
to them regarding the risk of awarding these large contracts.
In the USA, we are particularly excited about the potential of 
the newly refurbished Savannah Yacht Center in Georgia 
(“SYC”). GYG entered into a memorandum of understanding 
with SYC in August 2016 to establish a new painting facility to 
cater for superyacht refit projects. Whilst GYG already has 
bases in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, these facilities 
are mainly servicing yachts up to 70 metres therefore SYC 
opens up the 70+ metre US market. Post period end, the 
Group’s US subsidiary, Pinmar USA, won the first significant 
refit project on a circa 70 metre Dutch-built superyacht which 
has started this month and will run for approximately 14 weeks. 
Management anticipates SYC to form a major part of the  
US growth strategy as this shipyard capacity comes fully  
on stream in Q3 2018.
The Board has further targeted improvements to gross margins 
which are underpinned by a programme of management 
initiatives to improve production processes and internal 
systems. As a Group, we will continue to invest in technological, 
operational and our human resource development which will 
contribute to margin improvement as well as preserving the 
market leadership status of our portfolio of brands. 
Finally, the Board continues to evaluate earnings enhancing 
acquisitions to increase market share and enable expansion 
into new geographic markets or new complementary services 
to support the Group’s long-term strategy. Annual report and financial statements 2017 11

DIVISIONAL REVIEW
GYG is a market leading superyacht painting, supply and 
maintenance company offering its services globally through 
operations in the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and the 
USA. The Company’s brands include Pinmar, Rolling Stock, 
Pinmar Supply, Pinmar USA, Techno Craft and ACA Marine. 
GYG’s operations are separated into two divisions, Coating  
and Supply. 
The AIM IPO has certainly raised the profile of the Group 
providing a platform to engage directly with significant 
industry participants whilst giving corporate credibility and 
additional certainty to existing and potential clients. This has 
enabled the Group to continue growing market share in a 
growing market. In particular, the management team has a 
strategic focus on new build where it is looking to increase 
GYG’s market share as that market itself continues to expand.
COATING DIVISION 
This division, consisting of the refit and new build markets, 
performed very well in 2017 with revenue increasing 16.7%  
to ¤53.7m (FY16 ¤46.0m). This performance is underpinned  
by the industry trend of increasing average vessel size (44% 
growth in the last 11 years), resulting in a larger surface area  
to be treated. Particularly pleasing has been the 20% growth  
in revenue of the Group’s scaffolding company, Techno Craft.
With the recent contract win of a 117 metre new build in Norway 
and several large refit projects being carried out in new 
locations, the division is expanding its market share outside 
Spain while strengthening the Group’s reputation as a  
company that can achieve vast scopes of high quality work  
in short time frames. 
Importantly, the strong results in this division were achieved 
despite the challenges witnessed in the second half such  
as the hurricanes in the USA which not only interrupted 
production for a short period, but also disrupted normal 
cruising and refit patterns. 
Refit includes repainting and finishing of superyachts, normally 
as part of a refit programme, and its revenues also include 
scaffolding, containment and the removal of fittings undertaken 
by the Techno Craft business. 
A key driver of our business is that superyachts require a major 
survey and service every five years to comply with certain  
class regulations, maritime laws and insurance requirements.  
In addition, our strong warranty and network of relationships 
with shipyards supports strong repeat business enhancing 
revenue security.
GYG operates four brands in the refit sector each targeting 
specific regional markets and segments. Pinmar is the market 
leading brand focused on the large motor superyachts across 
all European refit locations. Pinmar USA is the leading brand 
on the East Coast of the USA, predominantly servicing the 
motor yacht market. Rolling Stock has its core in the sailing 
superyacht sector and specialises in metallic and performance 
coatings in Europe. ACA Marine, the Group’s most recent 
acquisition, is a regional brand focusing on the 40+ metre 
market in France.
GYG increased the scope of its refit network in 2017, signing 
commercial agreements with major refit shipyards in the USA 
and Italy which will facilitate the planned regional growth in 
2018, as stated at IPO. The Group also expanded its field sales 
force to service the enlarged network, implementing a tailored 
CRM system to manage the sales process. 
New Build covers the fairing and painting of new vessels as 
part of the build process and represents a significant growth 
opportunity for the Group.
2017 new build revenues were strong with the Group 
undertaking major projects in Holland, Germany and the USA. 
The fairing and painting of a new, large (70+ metre) superyacht 
will typically take 8-12 months, with the largest (150+ metre) 
vessels taking longer. Correspondingly, such major individual 
projects produce substantial and consistent revenues over  
a prolonged period contributing to the annual sales of the 
Coating division. 
Historically, GYG has been successful in winning major 
contracts to fair and finish iconic new build projects through its 
strong relationships with existing superyacht owners and their 
representatives. However, the paint contracts for the majority 
of the 50-70 metre new build projects are awarded by the 
shipyards to their long standing preferred local suppliers, 
hence GYG’s relatively low market share of 6% in this high value 
segment. One of the strategic drivers of the IPO was to further 
penetrate this sizeable market segment to drive the future 
growth of our new build operations. We are confident that we 
will be able to demonstrate to the leading new build yards in 
Holland, Germany and Italy that we can add value and reduce 
risk through our industry leading quality, production efficiency, 
project management protocols and global after sales service. 
Post period end, we signed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with the 
owner of ‘REV 182’, the world’s largest research and expedition 
vessel currently under construction. The 182 metre vessel, 
which is scheduled to be started in 2019 and delivered in 2020, 
will be contracted to the Group’s Rolling Stock division and the 
order includes the supply and application of the exterior filler 
and paint system for specified exterior areas of the vessel. 
This is the third explorer vessel of this type that GYG has been 
contracted to work on in the last two years, further establishing 
the Group as the specialist in this type of market. The works 
are scheduled to commence in 2019, strengthening the order 
book and providing a good visibility of income for the Group. 
SUPPLY DIVISION
The supply business operates through three distinct sales 
channels, namely retail, trade and superyacht provisioning.
The Supply division delivered revenues of ¤8.9m, up 4.2% on 
FY16 (¤8.6m). The retail turnover was in line with the previous 
year while the division’s growth came from the increased 
volumes through the trade accounts and the expansion of 
yacht provisioning. 
12 GYG plc OPERATIONAL REVIEW
During 2017, we completed a review of our production 
processes and have started to implement a number of quality, 
efficiency and productivity initiatives aimed at improving  
gross margins and reducing fixed costs. We expect to see the 
early benefits of these programmes over the course of 2018.
Through the Pinmar brand, GYG continues to lead the industry 
in terms of the delivery of quality standards. The Pinmar 
Standard was the first empirically based superyacht paint 
standard introduced to the industry in 2011, revolutionising  
the approach to the inspection and acceptance of paint works. 
In 2018, GYG launched the Pinmar Standard 2.0, an updated 
version of the standard which incorporates the expanded 
range of paint manufacturers and products available in the 
market today. 
The Group continues to innovate and invest in new application 
technology, leveraging its close relationship with all of the 
main superyacht paint manufacturers. Its adoption and 
industry development of electrostatic top-coat application is 
delivering significant time, quality and environmental benefits, 
further asserting the Group’s industry leadership. 
GYG continues to develop its Human Resources function  
with a structured in-house programme of skills development  
aimed at expanding the Coating division production capacity.  
We continue to strengthen our management team through 
strategic recruitment, bringing a mix of industry experience 
and related business expertise. 
We continue to improve our business processes, systems and 
infrastructure to support the growth and improve efficiency  
of the Group. In 2017, we implemented a new production 
application software to provide greater visibility and control 
over production activity, and a sales CRM system that provides 
data on the worldwide fleet of 5,700 superyachts and facilitates 
the management of the marketing and sales process. This has 
further improved our ability to forecast upcoming yacht  
refits and has provided our managers with a more efficient 
approach to marketing at the appropriate time before a refit. 
MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
The superyacht new build and refit painting market continues 
to exhibit consistent growth of approximately 6% per annum 
driven primarily by the refit market which, as previously 
mentioned, requires regular maintenance programmes. The 
new build market, particularly the larger superyacht segment 
(70+ metre), has been fuelled by the continued growth in the 
number of worldwide billionaires, (estimated 9% CAGR to 
2020) and continues to report growing order books and 
deliveries through 2020, indicating further new build painting 
and a growing fleet requiring refit.
We have noted the continuing increase in the size of vessels 
being produced and the demands this places on the global 
refit shipyard infrastructure. There are a limited number of 
yards with the infrastructure required to service the growing 
number of 100+ metre mega-yachts and GYG is well positioned 
with these yards to complete such orders. Time is a precious 
factor in the refit of these larger vessels as owners want access 
to their vessels or the ability to hire out during the main  
cruising season. The Group’s technical leadership and unrivalled 
experience in repainting the largest yachts to the highest 
industry standards, meeting clients demanding timescales, 
further accentuates our competitive advantage. 
OUTLOOK
The Group is well positioned in each of its core markets and the 
management team is focused on delivering the key objectives 
of revenue growth and margin improvement. The Group’s 
outlook for 2018 is positive with significant growth expected in 
the refit sector alongside further new build market penetration.
