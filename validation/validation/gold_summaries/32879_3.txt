 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 09
The acquisition of London & Colonial in late 
2016 has borne fruit during 2017 and has 
allowed us to quickly adapt to market changes 
so as to protect our new business stream. 
We have delivered a significant amount 
of cost savings by merging administrative 
processes across the Group whilst ensuring 
that the existing recurring revenue book 
continues to perform in a predictable and 
solid manner. We were also pleased to make 
the acquisition of Harbour Pensions Limited 
which subsequently completed post year end 
after receiving regulatory approval from the 
Malta Financial Services Authority.
As previously disclosed we have experienced 
regulatory issues in some of the jurisdictions 
in which we operate over the last few years. 
The Board’s objective is to address and 
minimise any risk in this area. Importantly, 
in early 2017 the appointment of a Head of 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) for the 
Group was made as part of further improving 
our corporate governance framework. Already 
in 2018 we have made important changes 
to our corporate governance arrangements, 
including proposed further appointments 
of NEDs to the subsidiary Boards, and the 
Group will be continuing to make more 
improvements over the rest of 2018.
One of the Group Board’s primary 
responsibilities is to ensure the provision of 
effective corporate governance. To this end, 
the Board is undertaking a full review of 
every aspect of governance well in advance 
of the AIM requirement to comply or explain 
against a recognised Corporate Governance 
Code by September 2018.
I am particularly pleased that my long term 
views regarding the potential benefits of re-
locating the Group head office from Gibraltar 
to the UK is now well underway. I feel that 
the business becoming more UK orientated 
will further build investor confidence, improve 
efficiency, and open further UK business 
opportunities for the Group.
The Board has a medium term vision and 
a strategy to continue to deliver enhanced 
profitability, whilst at the same time de-
risking the business further by continuing 
to expand the Group’s product range and 
its intermediary base whilst keeping costs 
firmly under control.
Finally, I have chaired the Board for the past 
three years, having also served as a Non-
Executive for the four years preceding that, 
and have enjoyed my time working with 
the team to make STM a success. However, 
after seven years of service I have made 
the decision to retire and enjoy more time 
with my family, and I therefore will not be 
standing for re-election at the forthcoming 
AGM in May 2018, with my retirement 
becoming effective on 23 May 2018. This 
in turn leaves the Board perfectly placed for 
the appointment of one or more UK based 
Non-Executive Directors to reflect the new 
London head office status, with the Board 
having already begun the recruitment process.
I would like to take this opportunity to 
personally thank all of the Group’s Directors, 
executive and staff for their efforts in making 
2017 such a success, and will avidly follow 
STM’s continued success in the future.
