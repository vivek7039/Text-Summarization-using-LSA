Finally, opening new countries, via a joint 
venture, remains a key priority and we have 
made good progress in FY17, with discussions 
in progress with multiple prospects.  
Dividend 
Given the Group’s performance this year 
and the Board’s confidence in its future 
prospects, the Board is proposing an increase 
in the final dividend to 11.2p a share, bringing 
the total ordinary dividend for the year to 
15.3p (FY16: 12.7p), an increase of 24%, which 
is 1.76x covered by the FY17 adjusted earnings 
per share compared to 1.72x in FY16. 
Board changes
During the year David Bower was appointed 
as Chief Financial Officer and Johnathan 
Ford as Chief Operating Officer. We have 
also strengthened the Board with the 
appointment of three new Directors with 
effect from 23 May 2017. Tom Rusin has 
been appointed as an Executive Director 
and Katrina Cliffe and Edward Fitzmaurice 
have both been appointed as Non-Executive 
Directors. Katrina will also join the Audit 
& Risk Committee. Tom has been Chief 
Executive Officer of HomeServe USA since 
July 2011 and is currently a member of the 
HomeServe plc Executive Committee. 
People 
HomeServe’s success is driven by the 
commitment of its people. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank all our people for 
their contribution to another set of very good 
results.

Chairman’s statement
I am delighted that the Group had 
another very good year delivering 
customer and profit growth, with 
continued investment to deliver our 
strategy. We have a clear vision “to 
be the world’s most trusted provider 
of home repairs and improvements” 
and we have agreed the strategic 
priorities (see page 12 for our 
strategic framework) to ensure we 
achieve it. 
There are four areas of progress in the 
year that I would like to specifically 
address in this statement. 
Firstly, the rate of progress in North 
America has been very positive. Through 
the strength of the existing business, 
enhanced with the acquisition of Utility 
Service Partners we have achieved the 
3m customer milestone and 50m affinity 
partner households – great progress 
toward our 80m household target. 
Secondly, the strength of affinity 
partnerships is the bedrock of our 
business and I am delighted with the 
launch of Aviva Response in the UK and 
the new joint venture with Edison Energia 
in Italy. Digital marketing is already live 
with both partners, a demonstration of 
our mutual commitment.
At the Capital Markets Day in June 
last year, we said we wanted to offer 
a compelling on demand service to 
homeowners. We have accelerated  
our plans with the investment in 
Checkatrade in the UK and the  
acquisition of Habitissimo in Spain.
