Spectris comprises four business segments which reflect the 
applications and end-user industries we serve. Our businesses 
are united by the same purpose, values and corporate strategy. 
They all work according to a strong common framework of 
controls, management key performance indicators, financial 
discipline and rigorous operating principles, but each business  
is focused on its own markets, customers and technologies.
In addition to providing strategic direction, governance, 
financial and operational input and oversight, the corporate  
centre provides support in areas such as M&A, HR, legal and 
tax. The centre also manages a procurement function and 
other supply chain initiatives which benefit our operating 
companies and facilitate the sharing of best practice.
