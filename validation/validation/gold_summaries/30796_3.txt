Introduction
My last full year as Chairman was a 
successful and eventful one. In May we 
were delighted to welcome Gestra to the 
Group. Gestra’ s market-leading automated 
boiler controls and strong market position in 
Germany increases the market share of our 
Steam Specialties division, improves access 
to the German market and provides potential 
to grow Gestra’ s presence outside its core 
German market. T wo months later, in July, 
electrical process heating and temperature 
management solutions provider, Chromalox, 
joined the Group. Industrial electrical heating 
solutions are complementary to our steam 
business and Chromalox’ s direct sales 
business model, based around application 
selling, diverse customer base and broad 
market diversity, make it an ideal fit. 
Three other important milestones have also 
been reached. In 2017, Group sales reached 
£1 billion, the Group’ s underlying trading 
margin, excluding acquisitions, exceeded 
24% and the proposed dividend marks the 
50th consecutive year of progress. 
The events of 2017 demonstrate that we 
are not content to let external circumstances 
dictate Group performance and outcomes, 
but are actively engaged in engineering 
opportunities for sustainable growth. I am 
deeply proud to have been the Chairman of 
this great Company for over nine years and 
in my last full year I am pleased to be able 
to report that, despite a very busy year, we 
maintained our rigorous focus on organic 
growth and delivered another strong set of 
results, outperforming our markets. 
Financial highlights
Sales for the year were £998.7 million, an 
organic increase of 6%; exceeding global 
industrial production growth of 3.4%. 
Favourable currency movements increased 
sales on translation by 5% and acquisitions 
added 20%. As a result, reported sales 
were 32% higher than 2016. Our Watson-
Marlow Fluid T echnology business had 
another strong year, which saw organic 
sales up 10%. The Spirax Sarco business 
also performed well with organic sales up 
5% and gains in all segments. Gestra, which 
is reported within the Spirax Sarco Steam 
Specialties division, performed in line with 
our expectations as did Chromalox, which 
is reported as a separate division within the 
Spirax Sarco business.
Group adjusted operating profit increased 
by 6% on an organic basis to a reported 
£235.5 million. Watson-Marlow delivered 
organic profit growth of 6%, with the Steam 
Specialties division up 6% organically . 
Favourable translation and transaction 
currency movements increased adjusted 
operating profit by 9% while acquisitions 
added 14%, resulting in adjusted operating 
profit being up 30%. The adjusted operating 
margin fell by 20 bps, to 23.6% as a result 
of the dilutionary effect of the two large 
acquisitions made in the year . Excluding the 
effects of acquisitions the underlying margin 
increased 90 bps to 24.7%.
The Group adjusted pre-tax profit was 
£229.1 million, 29% ahead at reported 
currency . Adjusted basic earnings per 
share was 29% ahead at 220.5 pence 
(2016: 171.5 pence).
The pre-tax profit on a statutory basis was 
£192.5 million (2016: £171.4 million) and 
includes certain items, explained in Note 2. 
The statutory basic earnings per share was 
214.4 pence (2016: 165.0 pence). 
Cash and dividends
During the year, we had a cash outflow 
of £484 million to fund the acquisitions of 
Gestra and Chromalox. As a result, at 31st 
December 2017 we had a net debt balance 
of £373.6 million, compared with net cash of 
£27.4 million at 31st December 2016; a net 
debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times. 
The interim dividend for 2017, paid on 10th 
November 2017, was raised by 13% to 
25.5 pence per share (2016: 22.5 pence 
per share). The Board is recommending 
an increase in the final dividend of 16% to 
62.0 pence per share (2016: 53.5 pence). 
Subject to approval of the final dividend by 
shareholders at the AGM on 15th May 2018, 
the total Ordinary dividend for the year is 
therefore 87.5 pence per share, an increase 
of 15% over the 76.0 pence per share for 
the prior year.
Corporate governance
As we announced on 14th February, I 
have indicated my intention to retire from 
the Board after this year’ s Annual General 
Meeting on 15th May 2018 (AGM), having 
served as a Director for 16 years and as 
Chairman for the past nine years. 
It is proposed that Jamie Pike, the current 
Senior Independent Director who joined the 
Board in 2014, will take over as Chairman 
with effect from the close of the AGM. As a 
consequence of Jamie’ s appointment, it 
“ The events of 2017 demonstrate that we are not 
content to let external circumstances dictate 
Group performance and outcomes, but are 
actively engaged in engineering opportunities for 
sustainable growth.”

Chairman
*  Unless otherwise stated, all profit measures exclude certain 
items, as set out and explained in the Financial Review and 
in Note 2 on page 129. Organic measures are at constant 
currency and exclude acquisitions. Strategic Report

is also proposed that Clive Watson be 
appointed as the Senior Independent Director . 
Clive will continue as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. All appointments are subject to 
the re-election of Directors at the AGM.
Jamie Pike will, on appointment as 
Chairman, resign as a member of the 
Audit Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee in compliance with the 
Code. He will Chair the Board and the 
Nomination Committee.
In anticipation of these changes we initiated 
a search for an additional Independent Non-
Executive Director and on 6th March we 
announced that Peter France will join the Board 
with immediate effect. Peter will be a member 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees. From 2008 to July 2017, Peter 
was Chief Executive at Rotork plc.
Employees
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
welcome our new Gestra and Chromalox 
colleagues to the Group and to thank all our 
employees throughout the world for their 
individual and collective contributions that 
have enabled us to deliver another excellent 
set of results in 2017.
Summary and outlook
Global industrial production growth rates, 
which are a good indicator of our market 
conditions, strengthened throughout the year 
resulting in growth of 3.4% in 2017 compared 
with 0.9% in 2016 and 0.3% in 2015. 
Current indications for the industrial 
production growth rate in 2018 suggest 
that it will be at a similar level to that seen in 
2017. We will remain focused on engineering 
opportunities for self-generated growth, 
through the rigorous implementation of our 
strategy. As we integrate and develop the 
recent acquisitions, we are also laying the 
foundations for their future organic growth.
Following two years of foreign exchange 
tailwinds, sterling has strengthened against 
most of the currencies that we trade in and 
therefore we expect a currency headwind 
in 2018. If current exchange rates were to 
prevail for the remainder of the year, 2017’ s 
revenues would have been 2% lower and 
trading profit would have been 4% lower. 
Movements in exchange rates are often 
volatile and unpredictable, therefore the 
actual impact could be significantly different.
For 2018, given the recent changes to the 
composition of the Group and the volatility 
of the main currencies we trade in, we have 
chosen to provide additional information 
in this outlook. Considering the current 
industrial production growth rates, we would 
expect a similar organic growth performance 
in the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties 
division as seen in 2017. As we continue 
the integration of the Gestra and Chromalox 
acquisitions, we expect these companies 
to grow at rates similar to global industrial 
production growth, over their full year 2017 
sales of £223 million. Watson-Marlow’ s 
revenue growth was higher than expected in 
2017 as a number of larger orders booked in 
late 2016 were shipped in 2017. Therefore, 
we maintain our expectations of mid-to-high 
single-digit organic sales growth for the 
Watson-Marlow Fluid T echnology business 
in 2018. 
Excluding acquisitions, the 2017 trading 
margin improved by 90 bps to 24.7%, 
due to the effects of positive exchange 
movements. As anticipated, the underlying 
margins remained constant as we reinvested 
operational gearing gains in the business. 
Looking forward, we will continue investing 
in the business for growth while also taking 
actions to mitigate the adverse transactional 
currency effects on margins that could occur 
if current exchange rates prevail throughout 
this year. Therefore, for Chromalox and the 
We confirm that to the best  
of our knowledge:
 − The Financial Statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation, taken as 
a whole. 
 − The Annual Report for 2017, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’ s 
performance, business model 
and strategy.
 − The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will 
be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three-year period to 31st 
December 2020. For the full Viability 
Statement, see page 80.
 − The Annual Report contains the 
information required for compliance 
with the Companies, Partnerships 
and Groups (and Non-Financial 
Reporting) Regulations 2016. 
The Non-Financial Information 
Statement comprises information 
found on pages 12 to 15 (business 
model), pages 30 to 33 (risks), and 
pages 52 to 61 (environmental 
matters, the Company’ s employees, 
social matters, respect for human 
rights, and anti-corruption and anti-
bribery matters).
 − The Strategic Report was approved 
by the Board on 14th March 2018.

Steam Specialties division, excluding Gestra, 
we anticipate maintaining the same level of 
operating margins achieved in the full year 
2017. However, due to the proportionally 
higher investments for growth in Watson-
Marlow and Gestra, we anticipate a small 
margin decline for these businesses in 2018, 
similar to Watson-Marlow’ s organic decline 
in 2017.
Assuming no significant deterioration in 
trading conditions, the Board expects to 
make further progress in 2018.
