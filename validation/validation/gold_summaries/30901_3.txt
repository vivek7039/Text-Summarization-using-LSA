 Strategic Report
I am delighted that we have delivered a 
trading result in line with expectations in 
2017 , as well as over £3bn of order intake 
and a further improvement in employee 
engagement. We have also added further 
skills and diversity to the Board, with strong 
governance being a key focus of the business 
at all levels. Whilst trading conditions are 
currently difficult in several of our markets, 
we have over the last three financial years 
delivered on the plan set out in 2015; having 
already stabilised the business, we have 
been improving our operating efficiency 
through our transformation programme. 
Importantly, as we now look ahead, we 
expect profits to start to grow over the  
next two years.
Serco’s mission is to be a trusted partner of 
governments, providing superb public services that 
transform outcomes and make a positive difference for 
our fellow citizens, whilst delivering attractive returns 
to our shareholders and rewarding careers to our 
employees. Our aspiration is to be the best-managed 
company in our sector, and our method to achieve this 
is through concentrating on doing four things really 
well: winning good business; executing brilliantly; 
being a place people are proud to work; and being 
profitable and sustainable. 2017 has produced tangible 
evidence of performing well against these objectives. 
I am proud of the work we do and of the continued 
progress being made.
Delivering our strategic plan
In 2015, we set out a three-stage plan for Serco: 
Stabilisation, Transformation, Growth. Stabilisation was 
largely completed in 2014 and 2015 with the recruitment 
of a new management team, recapitalising the business 
and delivering the corporate renewal programme. 
Transformation then started in earnest, and will 
continue through 2018 and 2019. In 2018 we expect to 
also start delivering the third phase – Growth.
Three achievements in 2017 underline the progress 
Serco is making. First, we had very strong order intake, 
at £3.4bn. This represents a book-to-bill ratio – the value 
of how much we add to the order book compared to 
how much revenue we are billing our customers – of 
over 100%, the first time this has been achieved since 
2012. The strong order intake, with very large contracts 
won in Health and Justice, underlines the progress we 
have made developing our customer propositions and 
business development skills.
Second, the work we have done transforming the 
business enabled us to meet our target of reducing the 
run-rate of our overheads by over £100m by the end of 
2017. We expect to gain further cost efficiency benefits 
in 2018, notably from merging the UK operations into 
a single entity, as well as further reducing our other 
central support costs.
Thirdly, Serco employs over 50,000 people, including 
those at our joint venture operations, the vast majority 
of whom are responsible for delivering on a daily basis 
critical and sensitive frontline services for Government. 
Our success therefore is dependent on how well we 
select, manage, organise, motivate, develop and engage 
the people who work for Serco. Every year we run a 
detailed ‘Viewpoint’ employee survey to gauge how well 
our colleagues think we are doing, and I am delighted to 
say that, for the fourth successive year, the aggregated 
measure of ‘employee engagement’ improved again in 
2017, with some 31,000 people responding.
You can read more about all of these points in the Chief 
Executive’s Review on pages 32 to 43.
Achieving our financial targets
Our initial guidance for 2017 Underlying Trading 
Profit was between £65m and £70m, with the result of 
£69.8m therefore coming in at the top of that range. 
Supporting this, we achieved our targeted cost 
savings through the delivery of operational efficiency 
improvements. Furthermore, we have continued to 
reduce the burden of loss-making contracts, which is 
also paramount to ensuring sustainable profitability. 
Chairman’s Statement
2017 has seen further progress in implementing 
the strategy presented to shareholders in 2015. 
The transformation of the business continues 
apace and is delivering significant improvements 
in our efficiency and competitiveness.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 06 After exceptional items, net finance costs and tax,  
the profit for the year was £0.1m.
Net Debt at the year-end was £141m, also better than 
our guidance at the start of the year. This equates to 
EBITDA leverage of 1.4x, well within our medium-term 
target range of 1–2x and comfortably below the 3.5x 
debt covenant requirement.
You can read more about the drivers of financial 
performance in the Chief Executive’s Review, with 
further detail provided in the Divisional Reviews on 
pages 44 to 49 and the Finance Review on pages 50  
to 68. 
Targeting further progress
As we look ahead to 2018, we expect Underlying 
Trading Profit to grow to around £80m on revenues of 
£2.8–2.9bn. Since the second half of 2016, we have been 
making progress on increasing our profit margin – a key 
deliverable of successfully implementing our strategy 
– and in 2018 we expect that further margin and profit 
progress will be driven largely by transformation savings.
Looking further ahead, we expect 2019 to be a year of 
further good growth in Underlying Trading Profit, which 
is again likely to be driven by additional transformation 
savings. As we have said previously, the rate of growth 
thereafter will be more dependent on our ability to 
grow revenues. The Strategy Review announced in 
March 2015 set out a long term ambition that the 
business could grow in line with a market which was 
expected to expand at a long term trend rate of 5–7% a 
year and deliver margins of 5–6%. Our margin ambition 
was predicated on three conditions: first, reducing 
costs as a percentage of sales; second, containing 
losses on onerous contracts and converting a number 
of them into profitable contracts on rebid; and, thirdly, 
increasing margins by growing revenues whilst bearing 
down on overheads. We remain broadly on track on 
costs and onerous contracts, but some markets, and 
in particular the UK, are currently challenging and 
therefore growing more slowly than their former trend 
rate. We can and will partly compensate for a weaker 
organic revenue outlook through increased actions 
on the cost base, and our ambitions of 5–7% revenue 
growth and 5–6% margin remain intact, but the timing 
of achieving this will be dependent upon when demand 
reverts to trend in our target markets.
Our Board
Serco’s Board has seen considerable change since I 
became Chairman in July 2015. In considering new 
members of the Board, we have been determined to 
have a mix of backgrounds and experience to ensure 
that we have a balanced, dynamic and effective Board.
During the year, Ralph Crosby and Angie Risley stepped 
down from the Board, both having joined Serco during 
2011. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to both 
Ralph and Angie for the sterling service they have 
given the Company through some very difficult times; 
in particular I would like to thank Angie for her expert 
leadership of the Remuneration Committee. 
I was delighted to welcome three new Non-Executive 
Directors – Lynne Peacock, Ian El-Mokadem and Kirsty 
Bashforth – each of whom bring highly relevant and 
complementary skills. Lynne Peacock has assumed 
Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee. The 
background and experience of each are detailed in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 86 to 87 and details of the 
selection process to the appointments are set out in  
the Nomination Committee Report on page 102.
Ed Casey, our Chief Operating Officer, left Serco at 
the end of 2017 after 12 years of dedicated service 
to the Company. For the last four years, Ed had been 
commuting weekly across the Atlantic, and we quite 
understand his desire to return to the US, where he is 
taking up a senior role with a company in a different 
sector. I would like to express the Board’s appreciation 
for Ed’s significant contribution, particularly in 
supporting the stabilisation phase of our strategy and 
developing our plans for the transformation phase. 
We do not currently intend to seek a replacement 
for Ed as Chief Operating Officer, but will distribute 
his responsibilities amongst members of the Serco’s 
Executive Committee, reflecting the strength of the 
established senior leadership of Serco.
We have continued in 2017 to further develop the 
effectiveness of our governance, operational resilience 
and organisational change processes. Your Board has 
also been actively involved in evaluating individual bids 
containing a particular concentration of risks, as well 
as meeting regularly with management responsible 
for the delivery of the Company’s key operations and 
for the development of new business. Board members 
regularly visit contracts and meet with members of the 
wider management team; in particular, Non-Executives 
participate in our Oxford Saïd Serco Management 
training course, which is attended by around 30 
managers and runs four times a year.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
07 Strategic Report
I am pleased to report that we have fully complied 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code with the exception of conducting an external-led 
Board evaluation, which, considering that our three new 
Non-Executive Directors joined in the second half of 
2017, the Board considered would be more appropriate 
to defer to 2018. As in previous years, the Board 
conducted an internally-led evaluation, as detailed on 
page 92.
The Board believes that strong governance is a vital 
component in the long-term success of the Company; 
further detail on our structures and processes are set 
out in our Corporate Governance Report on pages 86  
to 109, as well as the Committee reports.
Securing our future success 
Your Board is absolutely focused on long-term, 
sustainable shareholder value creation, and doing so by 
promoting the best interests of shareholders alongside 
those of our employees, customers, and the societies 
and communities in which we work. Serco has a clear 
strategy to transform the business and position it for 
long-term success in attractive markets, and is on track 
to achieve this through a highly effective executive 
management team and a committed workforce that 
cares passionately about public service delivery.
We will continue to transform the business and expect 
good profit growth in 2018 and 2019. Beyond, our long-
term ambitions for margins and revenue growth remain 
intact, but the timing of achieving these remains subject 
to seeing improvements in the trading conditions across 
our markets.
The current challenges in some of our markets are 
covered in the following section on Our Business, 
together with the Chief Executive's Review; importantly, 
these also cover the strong progress Serco is already 
making, the opportunities that are expected to arise for 
us, and the long-term effectiveness of the markets that 
remain in place.
I would like to thank all colleagues in the business for 
their efforts in achieving a successful 2017, and for their 
continued support in helping Serco to be a superb 
provider of public services that everyone will be proud 
to be associated with.
