 T
he rebased 
market has meant 
that it has been 
necessary for us to 
discount rates at certain 
of our properties on a 
targeted and tactical 
basis. This has inevitably 
affected the profit 
margins of the business, 
but we believe that the 
pricing environment is 
now much more stable. 
As such, these market 
conditions should be 
seen as the new normal. 
OVERVIEW
MARKET OVERVIEW
Barbados arrivals and competition
As expected, market conditions in 
Barbados remained challenging 
throughout the 2017 financial year. 
While arrivals to Barbados were up 
6.4% year-on-year for the January 
to October 2017 period (2016: 5.5%), 
this was the first full year of a 
rebased Sterling/USD exchange 
rate, which has had a negative 
impact on our business: the Group’s 
rates are priced in USD while the 
majority of customers are from the 
UK (around 75% on a room nights 
basis). This affects both the rates the 
Group is currently able to achieve 
at some of its properties, as well as 
demand for Barbados as a luxury 
tourist destination.
Recent data from the Barbados 
Tourism Marketing Inc shows that 
stay-over tourist arrivals from the 
UK have grown 0.7% year-on-
year for January to October 2017, 
compared to growth of 2.2% for 
2016. In addition, demand for luxury 
accommodation from UK travellers 
has declined despite the overall 
increase in numbers, and the villa and 
value market have tended to benefit 
from increased visitor arrivals. 
However, we remain confident in 
the underlying attractiveness of 
Barbados for UK travellers, given 
its reputation as a safe destination 
and the fact that it is fortunate to be 
located south of the hurricane belt. 
Barbados is very rarely affected by 
hurricanes and, during the recent 
hurricane season, we experienced no 
disruption at the hotels and saw no 
material impact on bookings.
In addition to daily flights from 
London Gatwick and Manchester by 
a number of different carriers, 
Virgin is running a new twice-
weekly service direct from London 
Heathrow from December 2017 to 
April 2018. There are also significant 
opportunities outside the UK market 
which the Group is working to 
capture, as set out further below. 
In particular, US arrivals to Barbados 
were up 14.2% year-on-year (January 
to October) compared to an 11.5% 
increase in the prior year. 
REVIEW OF FY 2017 
PERFORMANCE AGAINST 
STRATEGY
DAY-TO-DAY EXCELLENCE
Revenue – pricing and occupancy
Revenue for 2017 was $59.9 million, 
up 5.1% on the prior year (2016: 
$57.0 million). This reflected an 
improvement in occupancy in H2 
2017, partially due to the timing 
of Easter (which fell in H2 in 
2017, as opposed to H1 in 2016). 
Occupancy was 63.9% for the Group, 
up from 62.9% in the prior year. 
However, ADR fell 6.3% in the period 
from $378 to $354. This partially 
reflects the success of Waves 
Hotel & Spa, which contributed 
strongly to occupancy but had a 
lower average rate, especially in H1. 
Excluding Waves, ADR would have 
been $365, a reduction of 3%.
During the year, the Group reviewed 
the pricing strategy for some of 
its properties in response to the 
weakening of Sterling. Rates were 
discounted on a targeted and 
tactical basis in certain cases in 
order to drive occupancy in the 
context of the rebased market. 
ADR was maintained at The House 
and Colony Club, our properties 
with the highest rates. For these 
properties, maintaining rates has 
been a strategic objective in order 
to maintain differentiation among 
the hotels in the portfolio. In 2018, 
“We delivered a solid performance 
in 2017 against a background 
of changed market conditions”

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT we intend to continue to review 
pricing strategies for each property 
to ensure that we effectively balance 
occupancy and rate. 
During the year, we used targeted 
promotions to boost occupancy 
during slower periods. Over the high 
demand periods, our specialised 
US-based revenue team continues 
to be disciplined and cautious with 
discounting, leveraging both the 
Group’s excellent relationships with 
tour operators as well as its scale 
and its substantial share of available 
luxury rooms in Barbados. 
Target market and go-to-market 
strategy
Throughout 2017, the Group 
expanded its target market focus 
in response to the weaker UK 
market conditions. The sales teams 
in both the UK and the US were 
bolstered, and during the year the 
Group launched a new website to 
target direct bookings from the 
US. In addition, new contracts were 
signed with tour operators in the US 
and Canada, and the Group hosted 
a number of familiarisation trips for 
US operators. As a result of this, and 
the addition of Waves in 2016, the 
proportion of bookings from North 
America rose from 14% in 2015/2016 
to 17% in 2016/2017.
There are also both opportunities 
and challenges in relation to changes 
in the demographic of visitors. 
The number of older, repeat guests 
is declining so attracting new 
guests is an area of growing focus. 
An increasingly important market for 
us is the millennial segment, including 
families and “double income no 
kids”, who tend to value experiences 
and sustainability and for whom 
repeat visits are less common. As a 
result, when we are refurbishing our 
properties we continually focus on 
appealing to this segment as well as 
our more established guest-type.
In this regard, the marketing of 
Waves as a contemporary all-
inclusive spa resort has been 
highly successful, and resulted 
in an increase in the number of 
guests from the millennial category. 
Given the success of this offering, we 
have incorporated a new spa into the 
refurbished House, and continue to 
assess additional spa opportunities 
throughout the Group. 
COST CONTROL
Implementing cost control measures 
has been a key area of focus for the 
Group during 2017 given the pressure 
on rates. This has involved targeted 
streamlining and centralisation of 
back office functions, and the set-up 
of a central warehousing function 
which was operational from the 
end of calendar 2017. The impact 
of these measures is expected to 
be seen in the financial year ending 
30 September 2018.

ENHANCEMENT
We are continuously looking to 
improve the profitability of our 
hotels with our focussed three-
step programme of refurbishing, 
repositioning and repricing. 
These steps interplay to find the best 
combination of physical structure 
(refurbish), guest experience 
(reposition) and yield management 
(reprice).
In addition to our regular capex 
spend of 4% of each hotel’s revenue, 
we spent approximately $1.5m 
on special projects, as planned. 
The most significant project 
undertaken during the year was the 
refurbishment of the public areas at 
The House, as well as the addition 
of a new spa. The House was closed 
from mid-August to the beginning of 
October, and since its re-opening has 
seen a 9% increase in business-on-
the books, driven by a stronger rate, 
compared to the same time in 2016.
In addition, we added a coffee shop 
and ice cream parlour to Turtle 
Beach and a coffee and wine bar to 
Crystal Cove. These additions, along 
with targeted discounting, resulted in 
both of these hotels increasing their 
occupancy compared to the prior 
year, and enhanced our offerings 
compared to new all-inclusive 
competitors on the island.
The results of Waves Hotel & Spa, 
following the post-acquisition 
refurbishment, also illustrate the 
success of this strategy. Waves’ 
occupancy was the highest in the 
Group at 73%, and it maintained 
ADR significantly in excess of pre-
acquisition levels.
EXPANSION
During 2017, we acquired Treasure 
Beach, a 35 suite hotel located 
next to the Tamarind Hotel on the 
‘Platinum Coast’ of Barbados. At the 
time of the IPO in 2015 we set out 
our acquisition plan – to add hotels 
that complement our portfolio and 
that benefit from the Group’s scale. 
Treasure Beach is a great geographic 
fit, as well as meeting our criteria of 
acquiring under-performing hotels 
that can be refurbished, repositioned 
and repriced in line with our 
enhancement strategy. It reopened 
in December 2017 following $2.8m of 
refurbishments as a European-plan 
adults only resort. 
As a result of our acquisition strategy, 
our total room count is now 588 
compared to 483 at the time of the 
IPO. This is more than twice the 
nearest competitor on Barbados 
and gives the Group significant 
influence and leverage with tour 
operator partners.
During the year, the Group added 
two properties to its portfolio via a 
management contract and a sales 
and marketing contract. In October 
2016, the Group entered into an 
agreement to manage Hodges Bay 
Resort, a new 122-room luxury hotel 
in Antigua. 
In March 2017, the Group added The 
Landings Resort and Spa, an 85 
villa property in St. Lucia, with an 
agreement to provide a variety of 
services across the areas of sales, 
marketing, reservations, revenue 
management and public relations 
across all key markets.
The Group is continually assessing 
potential acquisition targets both 
in Barbados and throughout the 
wider Caribbean. We see a number 
of compelling opportunities ahead 
of us, and are constantly managing 
our cash flow and debt availability 
in order to ensure that we can 
take advantage of them as they 
present themselves.
OUTLOOK
Trading since the start of the new 
financial year has remained in line 
with market expectations, and our 
bookings are currently tracking 
ahead of the same period last year. 
As a result, the Group remains 
confident in its prospects for 2018 
and beyond.
