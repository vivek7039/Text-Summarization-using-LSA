 SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 8
chairman’s statement
The Board is pleased to report on a busy and successful year for the Group, which saw the business undergo a complete 
transformation to a Managed Services provider, delivering against our stated strategic objectives for the 2017 financial year. 
At the same time the Group achieved impressive growth in line with market expectations, delivering an increase in Group 
revenue of 65.1%, including 19.8% organic growth. 
The Group’s transformation consisted of the acquisition of Systems Professional Limited (“Sys-Pro”) in early July, 
complementing the Group’s existing managed services business, and an associated re-branding of the business from 
Daily Internet Plc to SysGroup Plc. This, combined with the subsequent disposal of the Company’s legacy, non-core 
SME Mass Market hosting division, resulted in the formation of a business focused exclusively on servicing the high value 
managed services market, with a strong focus on cloud.  
To facilitate the funding of the Sys-Pro, the Group completed an oversubscribed placing in July raising £5.0m gross and 
bringing a number of new institutional shareholders onto the Company’s register. In conjunction with the placing and 
acquisition, the Company also undertook a 40 for 1 share consolidation and sought court approval for the cancellation of 
its share premium account, leaving the parent company able to pay dividends in the future should it be appropriate to do 
so (see note 22).
In order to support the new business composition and operational focus, a number of organisational changes were 
implemented to restructure the Group, including the appointment of Julian Llewellyn as CFO and Amy Yateman-Smith as 
Non-Executive Director. I would like to welcome both Julian and Amy to the Board and I look forward to working with them 
as we continue to execute our growth strategy. 
The Board believes the Group now has in place the right platform, expertise and focused service offering to capitalise on a 
substantial market opportunity. The Managed Services market continues to evolve and remains highly fragmented, and the 
Board believes that a strategy of organic growth and targeted acquisitions, supported by the Group’s strong gross cash 
position of £3.5m and unutilised £2.5m acquisition facility, will deliver sustained, long-term value for shareholders. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their commitment and dedication to the business. We 
have started the new financial year with an improved operational structure and strong financial footing, which, combined 
with increasing levels of recurring revenue, leaves me optimistic for the Group’s growth prospects ahead.
