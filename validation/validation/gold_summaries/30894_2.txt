• The financial target is to create sustainable shareholder value 
over the next three years (2018-2020) by growing adjusted 
diluted earnings per share (EPS) within a range of 5-10% CAGR.
• The VEP is a three-year plan to deliver enhanced returns to our 
shareholders by raising the demonstrable value we deliver to 
our clients.
• There will be a deliberate focus on margin improvement and 
related pricing initiatives.
• The VEP will be driven by three key strategic themes: Digital 
First, Global Reach and Empowered Organisation.
• The target has now been built into in our senior management 
remuneration policy and the design of the 2018 Long Term 
Incentive Plans (LTIPs).

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
• Major UK Bank: a new contract was won for marketing 
communication and an existing contract for transactional 
communication was renewed, both for five year terms.
• Proximity: the partnership contract to provide communication 
services to the BBC for TV Licensing was renewed for a six year term. 
• HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs): good progress in 
the implementation of the contract for all outbound printed 
customer communication and forms fulfilment. Following 
successful migration of all fulfilment activity to our Newcastle 
operation in May 2017, Communisis assumed full accountability 
for all printed customer communications with the transition of 
circa 180 million packs annually into our Halifax and Liverpool 
transactional facilities beginning in October 2017.
• Overseas sales now represent 30% of total turnover (2016 26%).
• New York: good progress made with our US Editions office 
established in May 2017 to service clients in the financial services 
sector with content marketing services.
• Hong Kong: Communisis will open an office in Hong Kong in 
April 2018 for the sourcing of “premiums”; the gifts which 
accompany many purchases of luxury goods.
• Technology investment: the programme to install a single 
platform for the management of our international supply chain 
for marketing execution is planned to go live in Q2 2018.

bedrock of solid performance and deep client relationships to build 
upon. The growth strategy for the next phase is highly focused and
