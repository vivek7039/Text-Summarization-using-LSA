Business influences
Velocys is managed as a single entity and referred to as “the Company”. 
Throughout the Strategic report we highlight content relating to four 
areas that will be critical to our future success.
1
Technical 
expertise
We are recognised as leaders in 
smaller scale Fischer-Tropsch 
technology. We have expertise 
throughout the design, 
commissioning and operation 
of plants.

ENVIA –
our commercial 
springboard
The first commercial scale 
plant using Velocys’ technology 
is in operation in Oklahoma 
City . Our technology deployed 
at the ENVIA plant will be a 
springboard for commercial 
growth. 
3
Development 
of biorefineries
In partnership, we are 
aiming to develop a series 
of biorefineries in the US, 
to become a producer of 
significant volumes of 
cellulosic renewable fuels.

Focus 
market
Our primary focus market is 
the large, high growth market 
for renewable fuels in the US. 
“Velocys is well positioned, and we believe that our newly 
focused business model will drive commercialisation in 
the renewable fuels market, enabling our technology to 
be incorporated in multiple biorefineries that will help to 
expand the supply of renewable fuels that the world needs. ”

1. Business model
We initiate and drive the development of 
biorefineries from concept to full operations. 
By taking the lead in projects, we reduce 
delivery risk and accelerate growth. We plan 
to convert some or all of our equity stakes 
in the development (or project) company 
into equity in the operating plants. We will 
derive a stream of dividends from those 
equity stakes in the operating biorefineries. 
We also expect ongoing revenues from 
technology supply , service contracts and 
the licensing of our technology .
2. Leverage capabilities
We work seamlessly with our partners 
to deliver modular, fully integrated, 
financeable, cost-effective and 
operations-ready biorefineries. 
Using Velocys’ unique engineering 
and operational expertise as well 
as our proprietary technology, 
we continuously improve our 
integrated biorefinery offering.
3. Strategic partnerships
Our alliances, including manufacturing, 
gasification, product offtake and 
feedstock supply, are with strategic 
partners that have the resources, 
scale and capabilities to access large, 
high value markets at pace.
