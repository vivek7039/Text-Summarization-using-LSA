 Summary
FY17 was a landmark year in Alpha’s history. The
IPO in April marked the start of a new chapter
for the Group, providing the capital to make
signiﬁcant investments across all areas of the
business, whilst also raising our public proﬁle.
Although we listed less than 12 months ago, the
beneﬁts are already evident in the full year
performance of the Group, and as such I’m
pleased to report a strong set of ﬁnancial results.
Growth in revenue was up 60% versus FY16 and
underlying operating proﬁt increased 55%.
Board & People
Alpha’s success to date has been the result of the
passion, commitment and vision of its people and
2017 was no exception. On behalf of the Board,
I would like to thank everyone for their hard work
in making 2017 another successful year and am
looking forward to working with you to build on
this further in 2018.
We are also pleased to welcome Henry Lisney
to the Board in the role of Chief Operating Oﬃcer.
Henry joined Alpha in 2013 as a Portfolio
Manager before quickly rising to the role of
Operations Director prior to his appointment in
March this year as COO. He has been hugely
inﬂuential in developing all areas of the business,
spearheading the Company’s IPO last year, as well
as leading the expansion of our product oﬀering.
Henry’s rapid progression is testament to Alpha’s
culture of meritocracy. 
Looking ahead, the Group will continue to beneﬁt
from its founder-led management team. At the
same time, we are delighted to see many existing
employees progressing to take on more senior
roles, and this is playing a key role in ensuring
Alpha’s impressive culture continues to resonate
throughout the Group. 
It is particularly pleasing to note that
15 employees saw their ﬁrst tranche of share
options vest due to the overall strong revenue
performance of the Group and I believe this
increased level of ownership bodes well for a
company that has always thrived oﬀ its
entrepreneurial mind-set.
Dividend
The Board has a stated policy to target a dividend
of approximately 30 per cent. of the Group’s
underlying proﬁts after tax in each ﬁnancial year. 
In line with our stated dividend policy, we paid our
maiden interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share in
October 2017. The Board has recommended a
ﬁnal dividend of 3.4 pence per share giving a total
dividend for the ﬁnancial year of 4.9 pence per
Chairman’s Statement
“Our ﬂotation has already signiﬁcantly raised the proﬁle of our
business, whilst enabling us to make key investments and
accelerate our growth strategy.”

share. Subject to approval by shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2018, the ﬁnal
dividend will be paid on 16 May 2018 to
shareholders on the register at 13 April 2018. The
ex-dividend date will be 12 April 2018.
The Year Ahead
2018 will be our ﬁrst full year as a publically listed
business. Even with our strong performance to
date, we have only penetrated a small proportion
of our addressable market, one that will over time
become even larger with our recent entrance into
overseas markets and expansion into new sectors
such as the institutional and funds market. 
Having invested in technology, new product
development and infrastructure in 2017, along
with the growth of our team, we are well
positioned for further growth. Q1 has already
started positively and with a clear strategy and a
highly motivated team in place, I am looking
forward to the rest of the year with optimism.
