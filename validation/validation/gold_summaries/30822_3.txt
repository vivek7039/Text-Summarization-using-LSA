 Chairman’s statement
Our motivated and experienced staff ensure our centres 
remain vibrant and enticing to both customers and retailers 
in a fast-changing environment
As I come towards the end of my ﬁrst 
year in the role of Chairman, I have been 
phenomenally impressed by the business 
and the people who are the driving force 
behind its success. 
Spending more time in our centres and 
meeting staff, as I have done ﬁrst as a 
non-executive director and this year  
as Chairman, has conﬁrmed these 
impressions. Our vibrant centres are the 
best in their regions and are continuously 
changing to meet new customer and 
retailer needs created by today’s 
multichannel retail world. This constant 
evolution is directed by our experienced 
and ambitious management team  
whose drive is shaping the shopping 
centre industry.
The last 12 months
The last 12 months have been an 
interesting time in our industry –  
capital markets have been concerned  
by perceived headwinds in retail, from  
Brexit in the UK to structural issues in  
the US, as well as the impact of online.  
Yet throughout this period we have 
outperformed against our  
operational benchmarks.
Our success has come from ensuring our 
centres are the places where people want 
to be. Our purpose is to make customers 
smile, leading to strong footfall, increased 
dwell time and higher spend, and this, in 
turn, helps our retailers ﬂourish – resulting 
in high occupancy and near record levels 
of lettings and tenant investment.
In Spain, we enhanced our platform with 
the acquisition of Madrid Xanadú and 
advanced our plans for the world-class 
intu Costa del Sol shopping resort. In the 
UK, we continue to see encouraging 
levels of pre-lets on our exciting pipeline 
of development projects. 
The disposal of 50 per cent of intu 
Chapelﬁeld at a price in line with the 
December 2016 valuation underwrites 
our property values as well as recycling 
capital into our development pipeline.
Innovation is engrained in our business, 
and using our experience and expertise in 
the shopping centre industry, we continue 
to deﬁne the future of the shopping mall. 
intu Accelerate is just one example of this, 
testing out a range of pioneering ideas for 
both customers and retailers. Online, our 
premium content publisher and shopping 
platform, intu.co.uk, continues to see 
strong growth with sales through the 
website increasing by 50 per cent.
Corporate responsibility
I have always believed that behaving 
responsibly is fundamental to the best 
and most sustainable businesses. It is 
especially vital for a retail property 
business such as ours where our centres 
play a pivotal role at the heart of their 
communities. As a long-term investor 
in the UK and Spain, we focus on people 
and placemaking, and ensure our 
initiatives, measured through key 
performance indicators, align with  
the communities we serve.

Our vibrant centres 
are continuously 
changing to meet new 
customer and retailer 
needs, all directed by  
our experienced and 
ambitious management 
team whose drive is 
shaping the shopping 
centre industry.”

Chairman
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 6 I am pleased to report that the measure 
of our community investment, gross 
value added, remains stable on a like-for-
like basis at £4.6 billion this year, and we 
have reached our 2020 target for a  
50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions three years early.
As a long-term business and a major 
employer in many of the regions where 
we operate, we have an important role 
in the future and the wellbeing of our 
communities. We take our responsibilities 
seriously, whether that is ensuring we 
reduce our environmental impact or 
helping local people by working with  
a charity to provide prom dresses for 
students. Recognising the importance  
of locally created and relevant projects, 
my Chairman’s prize for 2017 has gone  
to The Bus Shelter MK, a project to 
provide short-term accommodation 
for homeless people in Milton Keynes 
in a converted double-decker bus.
Our people
I would like to convey my warmest 
thanks to my colleagues on the Board 
and to all our staff for their commitment 
and creativity. As I said in my introduction, 
I am remarkably proud of our people, 
from apprentices to senior managers, 
who day in and day out deliver the 
intu difference that sets us apart from 
the competition. 
Dividend
Your Directors are recommending  
a ﬁnal dividend of 9.4 pence per share, 
bringing the total amount paid and 
payable in respect of 2017 to 14.0 pence, 
unchanged from the 2016 dividend.  
A scrip dividend alternative may  
be offered.
Looking to 2018
As David discusses in his Chief Executive’s 
review, we are refocusing our strategic 
objectives. They are to deliver growth in 
like-for-like net rental income, building 
further on the previous three years of 
growth, all underpinned by operational 
excellence. Our development 
programme, focused on ﬂagship 
destinations and ﬁnanced through 
astute capital recycling and allocation, 
will add further organic growth.
The Bus Shelter MK
This unique partnership with intu Milton 
Keynes raised money to convert a bus to 
provide short-term accommodation for 
homeless people in Milton Keynes
Creating a pan-European portfolio
In December we agreed a recommended 
all-share offer for the company by 
Hammerson. The boards of Hammerson 
and intu believe that there is a compelling 
strategic rationale for the acquisition, 
which will bring together high-quality 
retail property portfolios and combined 
expertise to create a leading European 
retail REIT with a strong income proﬁle 
and superior growth prospects.
Both boards believe that, following the 
acquisition, the enlarged group will be 
better placed to enhance its position in 
its geographic markets and across its 
retail formats, with a more efficient and 
adaptable platform allowing it to respond 
to fast-changing consumer preferences 
and retail trends.
The transaction is subject to certain 
approvals and is not expected to complete 
until late 2018.
