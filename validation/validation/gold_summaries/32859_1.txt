In the backdrop of a challenging 
2017 , Petrofac delivered a 
strong performance. 
Our clients demonstrated their confidence 
with both new and repeat business, we 
saw a recovery in new orders, progressed 
new organic growth opportunities, reduced 
capital intensity, delivered an impressive 
safety performance, and continued to 
deliver high standards of execution. 
As a result, the business is on the path to 
recovery and well-positioned for sustained 
long-term success. 
Clearly, Petrofac’s 2017 performance was 
overshadowed by the investigation by the 
UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which is 
covered elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
Nonetheless, I want to thank the Board,  
our employees, our clients, and our 
shareholders for their support during  
this challenging period. Together, we 
demonstrated the underlying resilience  
of the business and continued to make 
progress in delivering our strategy.
I would like to provide an update on our 
three strategic themes, the evolving market 
environment, and my priorities for 2018 
and beyond.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Delivering organic growth
We progressed organic growth 
opportunities in both complementary 
geographies and adjacent sectors.
For example, we are bidding actively –  
and executing projects – in India, South 
East Asia, Turkey and Russia, where we 
have a full understanding of the risks and 
the capacity to deliver, and can build on 
existing client relationships and/or draw on 
previous experience. Indicative successes 
include our first ever Turkish project, for a 
new €340 million gas receiving terminal, 
and a return to EPC work in Russia with  
the award of a US$700 million contract  
on Sakhalin Island by Sakhalin Energy 
Investment Company Ltd.
In terms of adjacent sectors, we continue 
to extend our downstream credentials.  
In recent years, we secured several  
major refinery projects and, in 2017 ,  
were awarded a US$2 billion contract  
from Duqm Refinery and Petrochemical 
Industries LLC where we are a 50/50  
joint venture partner with Samsung 
Engineering. We are confident that, by 
replicating this approach, we can achieve 
similar success in downstream markets, 
such as petrochemicals, and win a share  
of the substantial capital investments that 
are planned in this sector.
We have also had some success in 
offshore wind. In 2017 , we made progress 
with the BorWin3 and Galloper projects, 
and were awarded a floating wind turbine 
research project by the UK’s Carbon Trust.
Reducing capital intensity
We made significant progress in reducing 
the capital intensity of the business.
We have concluded the sale of our interest 
in the Pánuco field in Mexico and have 
converted Santuario, the largest of our 
three remaining Mexican service contracts, 
into a Production Sharing Contract, where we 
have ownership of the underlying reserves. 
We have also driven further significant 
reductions in capital spending, and are 
bringing increased visibility to our cash 
management. Going forward, we expect  
to continue to divest non-core assets,  
but will be measured in our approach,  
in a way that protects shareholder value.
The Board has confirmed its intention  
to exit the deep-water market and the 
JSD6000 installation vessel has been 
reclassified as an asset held for sale.
A reassuring new order intake, 
providing good revenue visibility
I regard our 2017 new order intake of 
US$5.2 billion as a good outcome in a 
challenging environment, giving us a healthy 
order book and good revenue visibility.
Tendering activity remains high and we 
continue to maintain our bidding discipline 
to protect our margins in a competitive 
market. Upstream, there is the beginning  
of a recovery in capital spending plans and, 
downstream, we see a flow of opportunities 
and strong political will in several countries 
to expand capacity and play a wider role  
in the hydrocarbons value chain. 
In the UK, conditions remain difficult. 
Contract extensions for Chevron and BP 
were welcome and our Memorandum  
of Understanding with Danos in the US 
demonstrates our determination to pursue 
selected opportunities in those markets 
which we consider to be attractive and 
have knowledge of.
Focusing on our core 
Operational excellence continues to be  
a key theme for Petrofac and, in 2017 ,  
we continued our focus on best-in-class 
project delivery. This was achieved  
in tandem with an excellent safety 
performance which saw us outperform 
industry averages and receive several 
safety accolades from clients. 
We completed more than 239 million 
man-hours across the Group, handing  
over several projects to our clients. A good 
example is the Khazzan project for BP  
in Oman, where we celebrated first gas  
on Phase 1, extended an exemplary site 
safety record beyond 43 million man-hours, 
and secured a US$800 million contract  
for Phase 2.
A highlight in our EPS East business was 
the securement of a 10-year Framework 
Agreement for Petroleum Development 
Oman (PDO). While the market remains 
challenging for the EPS West business, 
ongoing consolidation in our sector is 
expected to bring new opportunities.
By building on our existing strengths,  
we are able to deepen our competitive 
position and deliver more value to clients. 
During 2017 , we continued to reduce  
our cost base whilst maintaining our 
delivery capability. 
I should stress that this approach to 
incremental improvement extends well 
beyond our operational capability: our 
environmental management systems were 
further refined, we brought more discipline 
to the way we manage and develop our 
people, and we continued to further 
develop and highlight our compliance 
agenda throughout the organisation.
Meanwhile, the events of 2017 forced  
a refresh of the senior leadership teams, 
with several internal promotions and a  
few external appointments, including John 
Pearson as Chief Corporate Development 
Officer and Group Managing Director, 
Western Hemisphere. This demonstrated 
the strength of our succession planning  
as well as our ability to attract external 
candidates of the very highest calibre –  
all without missing a beat in our delivery.

 Design  Build
The Khazzan gas field is a 
significant strategic asset for 
BP and also for the Sultanate 
of Oman.
Petrofac’s involvement dates 
back to 2014, when we were 
awarded the engineering, 
procurement, construction 
and commissioning (EPCC) 
contract valued at over US$1 
billion for Phase 1 of the field’s 
central processing facility. 
A particular challenge was  
the tight timescales, which  
put significant demands on 
our technical teams and 
entailed a total of almost 
43 million man-hours. 
First gas was delivered in 
August 2017 . The project was 
executed safely, on time and 
on budget, and the creation  
of In-Country Value was a 
guiding principle throughout.
We were then awarded a 
lump-sum EPCC contract, 
worth around US$800 million, 
for Phase 2 of the project.  
This speaks for our record  
for project execution. It also 
enables us to continue the 
relationship with BP and  
build on our considerable 
experience in the Sultanate.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED Solid foundations for  
long-term recovery
Although the short-to-medium-term 
conditions remain challenging, we do 
anticipate healthy increased long-term 
demand for energy. Signs of healthy 
recovery, coupled with robust global 
growth forecasts for the next few years,  
are fuelling a growing appetite for 
hydrocarbons and ongoing capital 
spending by resource holders, which 
Petrofac is well placed to capitalise on. 
The operational performance of 2017 , 
backed up by our delivery-focused  
culture, our commitment to continuous 
improvement, and our excellent client 
relationships, demonstrate that Petrofac  
is well positioned to succeed as the  
market continues to show encouraging 
signs of improvement.

Continuing to re-shape  
the IES business
A key objective of the year was to continue 
to deliver value from the IES portfolio and 
position the business as a route to our 
wider services.
Besides the Pánuco divestment,  
progress included the migration of our first 
Production Enhancement Contract (PEC)  
to a Production Sharing Contract (PSC), 
which constitutes the first such migration in 
Mexico and a pathway for our remaining two 
PECs. Meanwhile production commenced 
from the Greater Stella Area development 
in February, resumed in Tunisia in May, 
following extensive shut-ins due to  
civil unrest, and continued in line with 
expectations, albeit slightly lower on  
the previous year, in Malaysia. 
Priorities for 2018
For 2018, you can expect us to continue to 
pursue faithfully our three strategic themes: 
focusing on our core, delivering organic 
growth in those markets and sectors that 
we know and where we can manage the 
execution risk very effectively, and reducing 
capital intensity.
A personal priority for 2018 is to pay even 
closer attention to the way we manage  
and develop our employees and plan  
our long-term succession. Ultimately it is 
our people who are the key to Petrofac’s 
distinctive, delivery-focused culture,  
and 2017 was the ultimate test. In the  
face of considerable pressure, our 12,500 
people stepped up, worked hard, and 
demonstrated a remarkable level of 
commitment and loyalty to the Company, 
and for that I would like to reiterate my 
profound thanks.
2018 is also bringing some changes to our 
Board. After 1 1 years’ service, including 
three-and-a-half as Chairman, Rijnhard  
van Tets is stepping down and I would  
like to thank him for his clear sense of  
duty and support of the leadership team. 
Similarly, I pay tribute to Thomas Thune 
Andersen, who stepped down at the end 
of 2017 , thank him for many years of wise 
counsel, and wish him well for the future.
