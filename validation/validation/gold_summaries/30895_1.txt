 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW
Making a difference
Inmarsat delivered further 
operational and strategic 
progress in 2017 , comprising 
both gratifying near term 
revenue growth as well as 
several important strategic 
proof-points around exciting 
medium-term growth 
opportunities, especially in 
In-Flight Connectivity (‘IFC’)
STRONG PERFORMANCE 
ACROSS OUR BUSINESS 
UNITS THROUGHOUT 2017
Our solid operational progress supported 
the Group in delivering revenue growth 
of over 5% for the year, with our investment 
in Global Xpress, our high bandwidth global 
mobile satellite network, starting to show 
material returns, generating over $140m 
of revenue in the year.
Indeed, there were strong performances 
across our business units throughout 2017:
 › In Maritime, we made important strategic 
progress in securing the long-term future for 
Fleet Xpress, with significant commitments 
signed with leading distribution partners. 
After a challenging year in 2016, which 
continued into Q1 2017, we delivered 
quarter-on-quarter growth for three 
consecutive quarters and year-on-year 
revenue growth in the fourth quarter
 › In Government, we delivered on our strategy 
to increase our contracted revenue base 
and diversify our customer and product base, 
supported by another excellent operational 
performance during the year
 › In Aviation, we further established our 
market position in IFC through commercial 
momentum and strategic investment, 
and our core business delivered double 
digit revenue growth throughout 2017
 › Enterprise continues to make progress 
notwithstanding challenges, by focusing 
on mobility applications. We remain 
optimistic about the long-term future 
demand for M2M connectivity in the 
emerging global Internet of Things 
(‘IoT’) market
We also delivered several notable successes 
in the development of our global networks –  
in particular:
 › We successfully launched our fourth 
GX satellite in May 2017, to provide global 
in-orbit redundancy and additional 
capacity and capabilities into new 
regional growth opportunities

CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 08 Strategic Report | Chief Executive’s strategic review capacity to invest in new skills to support 
the future growth of the business. Whilst this 
was unsettling for many of our staff, it was an 
exercise that had to be undertaken to ensure 
the business has a solid functional backbone 
from which to support our growth in the future.
There were also a number of changes to our 
Executive Management team during the year. 
Leo Mondale, President of our Aviation Business 
Unit, and Michele Franci, our Chief Technology 
Officer, both left the business in 2017. I would 
like to thank both Leo and Michele for their 
significant contributions to the business over 
the years and I wish them all the very best 
for the future.
Phil Balaam, previously our Chief Strategy 
Officer, replaced Leo as the President of our 
Aviation Business Unit, running our global 
Aviation IFC and core businesses, and 
Peter Hadinger, previously President of our 
U.S. Government Business Unit, steps up to 
become our new Chief Technology Officer. 
Susan Miller in consequence steps up to 
become the President of our U.S. Government 
Business Unit, bringing together our wholesale 
and retail U.S. Government sales activities 
under one roof, and stepping up onto Inmarsat’s 
Executive Team. I am pleased to say that Phil, 
Peter and Susan are all vastly experienced 
and highly skilled operators in the satellite 
industry and I am extremely confident that 
they will help to further drive the performance 
and development of the key parts of the 
business that they now lead. 
At the end of the year, we also created a 
new division within the business, the Product 
Group, led by Nick Thexton as our Chief Product 
Officer, who joined us last year from YouView 
and previously spent many years in a number 
of senior roles at Cisco Systems and NDS. 
Nick also joined Inmarsat’s Executive Team. 
This newly created product team has 
been established through a spin-out of 
our end-to-end product development and 
management activities in our current technology 
division, our business units and our finance 
division, bringing together all product-related 
activities under one roof, and the addition of our 
nascent and fast-growing digital services team. 
We believe this will provide more focus and 
agility in our product and service innovation, 
development and life cycle management, 
both digital and non-digital. The team will 
work as a catalyst between the business units 
and the central functions, focusing on the 
strategic and commercial value of these 
services, as well as driving a multi-disciplinary 
approach to building them. Our technology 
division’s focus will tighten to global networks 
and operating systems.
INMARSAT REMAINS WELL 
POSITIONED TO CAPTURE 
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH 
OPPORTUNITIES
Our performance in 2017, supported by the 
impact of these organisational developments, 
will help to ensure that Inmarsat remains well 
positioned to capture the significant growth 
opportunities that will become available 
in the coming years, as a result of two major 
demand drivers.
Firstly, the current demand for global 
mobile satellite broadband services continues 
to grow more rapidly than in many other 
satellite segments. Secondly, lower speed, 
high resistance satellite connectivity services 
to support emerging Io T applications offers 
significant growth potential over the 
medium to long-term.
Both of these areas will be driven by further 
growth in demand for mobile connectivity 
services in the Maritime, Government, 
Aviation and Enterprise markets, supported 
by the ongoing surge in data utilisation 
by users on the move and around the world.
 › Our S-band satellite was also successfully 
launched in June 2017, to become an integral 
part of our new European Aviation Network 
(‘EAN’), to be combined with a complementary 
air-to-ground component network 
recently completed by Deutsche Telekom 
and expected to be launched in 2018
 › We completed the design and procurement 
of our fifth GX satellite, announced and 
initiated in July 2017 and expected to 
be launched in late 2019, and our two 
replacement Inmarsat-6 satellites remain 
on track for their launches in 2020 and 
2021, respectively and
 › We procured launchers for two of 
these satellite programmes: comprising 
Arianespace’s Ariane-5 for GX-5 (2019) 
and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ H-IIA 
rocket for Inmarsat-6F1 (2020)
These planned investments in our network 
infrastructure drove an increase in capital 
expenditure in 2017, which was the primary 
driver behind the reduction in free cash flow 
in the year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Group declined by 
5.5%, in the year, with revenue growth offset 
by further planned investment in IFC market 
capture and service delivery and in developing 
our networks and back office infrastructure, 
as well as changes in revenue mix.
SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN 
LEADING TO MAJOR CHANGES 
TO THE ORGANISATION DURING 
THE YEAR
There were a number of significant 
people-related actions carried out during 
the year, which led to major organisational 
developments across our business.
During the fourth quarter, we initiated a 
headcount reduction programme to reduce 
our legacy costs, ensuring that we have the

CONTINUED
With two complementary global satellite 
communications networks (each with in-orbit 
redundancy), we are fully focused on mobility 
markets. With a 38-year history and reputation 
of delivering reliable and agile connectivity 
services to customers, we are very well positioned 
to retain and capture a leading market position 
in both global mobile broadband and satellite 
IoT markets. Our confidence is supported by our: 
 › Unrivalled presence in key end markets, 
with a disciplined focus on end users for 
whom our services are highly differentiated 
and mission critical, supported by strong 
local market access and licensing, following 
many years of relationship-building and 
investment. We are the current global leaders 
in the supply of satellite telecommunications 
services to the maritime, government and 
aviation sectors
 › Long-standing and sustainable 
advantage in global coverage, enabling 
our customers to utilise a seamless, 
consistent service wherever they are in 
the world, ensuring they have reliable, 
always-on connectivity across our truly 
global technology platforms
 › Owner economics, ensuring we provide 
a high quality service to customers, meeting 
their capacity requirements and delivering 
for them an optimised value proposition 
 › Established global distribution networks, 
both through direct and indirect channels, 
providing a diversified route to market, 
global access and reach, specialisation 
and customer intimacy
 › A clear technology roadmap, based on 
an open network architecture, enabling the 
agglomeration of diverse future technologies, 
as appropriate, with a unique ability to:
 – Augment our global GX network 
through new, agile, lower cost technologies, 
focused on areas of high demand, to 
remain a leader in coverage, capability, 
capacity and cost. This will translate 
over the medium-term into high relative 
returns on investment and ensure we 
continue to efficiently deliver a lower cost 
per bit to our customers, while maintaining 
tight control over the timing and extent 
of our capex. As a consequence we expect 
infrastructure capex to meaningfully 
moderate after 2020
 – Renew our valuable and differentiated 
L-band services with the current 
investment in the Inmarsat-6 generation 
of satellites, which will replace our 
Inmarsat-4 series. This will also help us to 
pursue complementary medium-term 
L -band growth opportunities in 
emerging global IoT markets and 
other new opportunities
In Maritime, we are confident that our future 
growth will be founded on continued progress 
in penetrating the maritime VSAT markets 
and by diversification of our L -band business 
into new market segments. In Government, 
we remain well-placed to capture value over 
the medium-term as the trusted provider 
of unique space-based capabilities to 
governments as and when near-term budgetary 
and operational tempo headwinds start to ease. 
In Enterprise, future growth is targeted in the 
emerging IoT opportunity, where we expect 
satellite services to play a substantial global 
role over the medium-term. Finally, we expect 
that Aviation will be the largest individual growth 
driver for the overall business in the coming 
years, through the consistent double-digit 
growth trajectory of our core Aviation business 
(composed of services to the Business and 
General Aviation segment and the Safety and 
Operational Services segment) and through 
the significant medium-term growth potential 
of our fast-emerging and substantial IFC 
Aviation business.

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 Strategic Report | Chief Executive’s strategic review Based on our future delivery against these 
strategic objectives, we remain confident 
in the medium to long-term growth outlook 
for the business. This confidence reflects the 
strong long-term growth anticipated in our 
key mobile satellite communications markets, 
our market-leading global broadband GX 
capabilities, our unique competitive position 
within each of the fast-growing Aviation markets, 
the resilience and agility of our established 
L -band business and its future growth potential, 
the power of our global distribution channels 
and our full-service global mobile offering.
Building on the strong positive momentum 
achieved in 2017, and based on our recent 
contract wins in a number of markets, 
we expect to deliver further revenue growth 
in the short term, to come mainly from 
material new GX revenue streams. We expect 
our L -band business to remain resilient over 
the medium-term, given its differentiated 
characteristics, with future growth coming from 
the emergence of new market opportunities, 
such as IoT, services to smaller vessels and 
aircraft, and next generation maritime 
and aviation safety services.
A STRATEGY DESIGNED TO 
FUTURE PROOF OUR BUSINESS 
Given Inmarsat’s track record, unique capabilities 
and differentiated market position, we are well 
placed to continue to grow our revenues in 
2018 and beyond and to capture significant 
medium-term growth opportunities available 
to us in each of our chosen markets.
This will be supported by our strategy, 
outlined in more detail on the next few pages 
of this report, which is to be an ‘enabler for 
the connected world’. This strategy is based 
on the following priorities:
 › Capturing the maximum number 
of broadband platforms
 › Re-positioning our L -band services 
for new growth
 › Establishing our digital platform  
and business
 › Creating a high-performance 
organisation and
 › Transforming our operating environment
We are targeting mid-single digit percentage 
revenue growth (excluding Ligado) on average 
over the next five years, with EBITDA and free 
cash flow generation (both excluding Ligado) 
expected to steadily improve as a result of the 
combined impact of this growing revenue base, 
an improved revenue mix, tightly managed 
overhead costs and new, lower cost, satellite 
technologies being implemented. We expect 
these factors to drive a meaningful moderation 
in our annual infrastructure capex over 
the medium-term.
Finally, I would like to thank our employees for 
their support and hard work over the past year, 
in particular for their willingness to embrace 
change. And I would like to thank our partners, 
customers, shareholders and other stakeholders 
for the trust and support they continue 
to give us.
