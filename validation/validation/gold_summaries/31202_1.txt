 Chief Executive Officer’s review
Strategic progress
Keller’s vision is to be the world leader in geotechnical solutions. 
We will achieve this through five strategic levers:
 – Growing our product range and entering new markets, 
organically and by acquisition.
 – Building strong, customer-focused businesses.
 – Leveraging the scale and expertise of the group.
 – Enhancing our engineering and operational capabilities.
 – Investing in our people.
Growth
In 2017 we consolidated our positions in our key markets by 
extending our branch network, as well as extending our product 
range. Examples include new branches in Hamburg and Charlotte, 
bringing our soil mixing capability into Singapore and Malaysia, 
our first diaphragm wall jobs in India and introducing new ground 
improvement techniques into South Africa. We also invested in 
a new Keller Marine team to leverage our experience in Australia 
in near-shore marine construction into new geographies. This 
team is already actively bidding work in India and Africa.
We completed two small acquisitions: Geo Instruments in 
North America to enhance our instrumentation and monitoring 
capability and, via our Finnish joint venture, Sotkamon Porapaalu, 
expanding our regional footprint in Finland and gaining capability 
in a specific type of drilled piling. In January, we announced our 
intention to acquire Moretrench, a geotechnical contractor in the 
US. If completed, this acquisition will further strengthen our US 
East Coast presence and add new specialist technical capabilities 
to the group.
Strong business units
During the year we completed the roll-out of our standard 
strategic planning model to all 21 business units. All business 
units now have detailed strategic plans in a common structure, 
incorporating specific action plans which are being implemented. 
In addition, we continue to strengthen our business units through 
functional engagement and active benchmarking of our key KPIs.

Since 2013, our Think Safe 
programme has helped 
reduce accidents in our 
business by around 77% and 
our Accident Frequency Rate 
is at an all time low.
We executed 6,300 projects 
throughout the world in 2017 .

progress on operational 
productivity with our 5S 
rollout in all business units.
Leverage of group and divisional scale
Our procurement capability continues to gain strength and 
traction, with teams now established in each division. Significant 
benefits from this investment are already being realised. We have 
also created one global IT organisation. This pulls together our 
efforts on infrastructure and applications, reducing the burden 
on local teams as well as creating economies of scale.
Enhancing engineering and operations
Our Global Product Teams are helping us focus on R&D 
opportunities, developing product strategies and continuing 
to share best practice and innovations. We also continued to 
make progress on operational productivity, with our 5S roll-out 
implemented across Keller and starting to become part of the 
cultural norm. We will continue to build our ‘lean’ capabilities 
in 2018.
We executed 6,300 projects throughout the world in 2017 . These 
continue to set the standard in the industry and enhance Keller’s 
strong reputation for providing innovative solutions, combined 
with excellent execution focused on our customers’ needs. 
Average project size is still comparatively small at £300k per 
project. Local and smaller projects remain the foundation of 
Keller, supported by our extensive branch network (around 180 
locations) and our skilled local teams who know their markets 
and customers well. We also had significant success in the large 
project domain with many market-leading projects across all 
regions. Most notably, the Caspian project has set the 
benchmark internally for a very well-conceived and executed 
effort in a challenging environment.
The vast majority of our projects were executed well and, 
between them, they generated around £370m of gross profit 
in 2017. In APAC, however, where the difficult pricing and 
contractual environment of the 2015/16 downturn left little 
project contingency, we have underperformed our expectations 
notably on two major Australian projects. Risk and opportunity 
management remain an enduring focus area and we are confident 
that lessons learned from all loss-making projects are being 
shared and absorbed around the group.
Investing in people
Throughout the year we have continued to strengthen our 
business unit leadership. We have appointed new leaders in a 
number of our business units: Canada, Middle East, North East 
Europe, Case and Brazil. We also launched our global Project 
Manager Academy. The Academy will take our younger project 
managers to the next level in their careers, focusing on people, 
commercial and technical leadership skills. 
We continued to make progress in our safety accident frequency 
rate (AFR) performance, with another significant decline in the 
frequency rate from 0.34 in 2016 to 0.23 in 2017. We have cut our 
AFR by around 80% since the introduction of our Think Safe 
programme in 2013. We received many safety accolades from 
customers around the world, with one of our Australian business 
units winning the Rio Tinto worldwide safety award. However, we 
take nothing for granted in this domain, sadly illustrated by the 
tragic road traffic accident in South Africa where 18 of our 
colleagues lost their lives. We thank our whole community in 
South Africa for the support and humanity they showed to all the 
bereaved and their relatives in the difficult time last summer.

2020 benefits target
We said in our 2016 preliminary results announcement that we 
expected to realise £50m of annualised total gross benefits from 
the group’s strategic initiatives by 2020, around half of which was 
expected to be reflected as improved profitability. We broke this 
down as £20m to come from procurement, £20m from operational 
improvements and £10m from growth. Progress against this 
target at the end of 2017 is set out below:
Gross benefits (£m)
2020 
target
Progress 
to date
Procurement 20.0 11.3
Operational improvements 20.0 1.3
Growth 10.0 4.6
50.0 17.2
In the first year of a four‑year programme we have achieved 
around one‑third of the targeted gross benefits. We estimate 
that between £5m and £7m of the benefits realised to date 
have directly impacted profit and are sustainable. Of the rest, 
either their sustainability is as yet unproven or they have been 
leveraged to win more work, or offset by incremental investment 
in strategic initiatives.
Meaningful procurement savings have been achieved from 
national and regional agreements on categories as diverse as 
equipment rental, IT, haulage, spares/consumables and lodging. 
The benefits from Operational improvements to date mainly 
relate to equipment management and maintenance, as the 
programme to introduce lean techniques to project sites is in 
its infancy. Benefits under growth include both those from new 
offices and from a more structured approach to the transfer 
of technology.
Summary
Overall Keller has had a positive year with good growth in group 
revenue and profits. The results were extremely strong in EMEA 
and solid in North America, but disappointing in APAC. Ongoing 
operational improvements, strengthened leadership and market 
recovery should lead to APAC returning to profitability in 2018. 
Our confidence in group fundamentals and the recent US tax 
changes have allowed us to significantly raise the dividend to 
shareholders.
The order book of over £1bn gives us confidence as we start 
2018. Most of our markets remain robust and bidding activity 
is at a healthy level. Overall, despite the completion of our 
excellent Caspian project, we expect 2018 to be another year 
of underlying progress.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Taking Keller to the next level
Around 100 leaders attended 
Keller’s Global Leadership 
Conference in Dallas in 
October. 
Themed ‘Delivering 
excellence’, the event 
combined presentations 
from the Board, Executive 
Committee, customers and 
consultants. Discussion 
sessions shared best practice 
projects, improvement 
initiatives and business 
unit performance. 
Delegates also had the 
chance to visit the local 
Keller branches of Suncoast, 
Hayward Baker and Bencor. 
But perhaps the biggest 
benefit of all, was the ability 
to network with colleagues 
from around the globe and 
discuss how we can continue 
to deliver excellence today 
whilst driving growth and 
improvements for the 
longer term.
