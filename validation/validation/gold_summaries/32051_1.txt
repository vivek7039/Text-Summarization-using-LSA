 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STRATEGIC REPORT
FY17 was another very exciting year for Joules as 
the brand continued to expand across distribution 
channels and product categories both in the UK and 
internationally.  The strong progress delivered during 
the year was again underpinned by our focus on our 
customers and our dedication to provide quality 
products and engaging experiences across all channels. 
THE JOULES BRAND
Ever since Tom Joule established the Joules brand 
nearly three decades ago, Joules has been committed 
to surprising and delighting its growing community of 
customers with a sense of quirky Britishness.  The Joules 
brand remains distinctive not only for its exciting use of 
colour, proprietary hand-drawn prints and unexpected 
details but also for its values that truly connect with 
our customers.  We aim to be an uplifting part of our 
customers’ lives whenever they are spending quality time 
doing the things they love with the people who matter.
The brand’s continued expansion and success was 
recognised at the 2016 Drapers Awards where Joules 
won Mainstream Brand of Year against strong 
competition from other leading lifestyle brands.  This 
award represents a strong stamp of approval from the 
fashion industry for our brand and our talented and 
enterprising team.  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS MODEL
OUR BUSINESS MODEL – BORN TO BE MULTI-CHANNEL
Joules was established as a multi-channel brand.   
Our distribution model enables our customers to easily 
engage with the Joules brand and to discover our 
products, shop, pay and collect their purchases in the 
way that suits their lifestyle. 
This multi-channel approach is reflected in the Group’s 
revenue mix between our two key, complementary 
distribution channels: Retail (including stores, 
e-commerce and the country shows and events circuit) 
and Wholesale.  The Group has a small but growing 
product licencing channel which, given the strength 
of the Joules brand, we are confident will become 
increasingly important over time. 
These complementary routes to market underpin our 
focused growth strategy.  Being truly multi-channel 
enables the Group to expand its product offering, 
enter new markets efficiently and exploit further 
growth opportunities within existing ones while 
always maintaining flexibility to meet and exceed our 
customers’ changing needs.

STRATEGIC PILLARS - PRIORITIES AND DEVELOPMENTS
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY 
We have a clear strategy for the long-term sustainable development of Joules as a premium lifestyle brand both in the 
UK and internationally.  This strategy is built on the key pillars described below and is underpinned by our distinctive 
brand, unique products and customer focus.  These pillars of growth are delivered by our exceptional team of people, 
supported by a well-invested infrastructure and supply chain.
1. INCREASING CUSTOMER VALUE - we intend to continue to grow our customer database, increase the number  
of active customers and develop the value of the average active customer through providing consistent and relevant  
cross-channel communication
2 DRIVE TOTAL UK BRAND SALES - as a multi-channel brand, we seek to grow total UK brand sales within target 
customer segments by increasing the availability and accessibility of our products across existing and emerging 
distribution channels - making it easy for our customers to discover, research, purchase and receive our products.   
Our priorities are:
• STORE ROLL-OUT - there is significant further growth potential for the brand in the UK and ROI.  We target  
a net 10 to 12 new stores per year in the medium-term as well as relocating a number of existing stores to larger 
sites that better reflect our brand and product range
• E-COMMERCE – e-commerce is a fast growing and rapidly evolving channel.  With ongoing enhancements to our 
e-commerce platform, the customer proposition and our customer management capability, we aim to increase 
the mix of e-commerce sales as a proportion of our total retail sales
• WHOLESALE – we broaden the reach of the Joules brand through wholesale customers that are closely  
aligned with our brand values and product categories - including independents, department stores and online 
retailers. Our wholesale capabilities position us well for emerging channels such as online marketplaces and 
‘Fulfilled by’ models
3. INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION - the Joules brand and products resonate well in international markets.  We develop 
international markets via a wholesale model supported by e-commerce, leveraging our investment in central creative 
and design functions and our infrastructure.  Our current priority markets are North America and Germany
4. PRODUCT EXTENSION - as a premium lifestyle brand, the Joules product offer naturally extends to meet many of 
the lifestyle needs of our customers.  Joules has had success extending the product offer within existing categories 
and into new categories and we will continue to expand into new areas that are appropriate for the development of 
the Joules brand, both organically and through working with carefully selected licence partners 2. DRIVE TOTAL UK BRAND SALES: 
• New stores: opened 13 new stores and closed two stores  
in the year
• Portfolio management: relocated three stores and 
expanded a further three stores
• E-commerce revenue: represented 35% of total  
retail sales
• E-commerce proposition: new payment options and site 
personalisation deployed in the year – helping drive  
improved conversion metrics
• Cross-channel: ‘Order in Store’ roll-out completed in 
H1 enabling store staff to place a customer order via 
a tablet device, facilitating access to our full product 
range in all stores
• Wholesale: Next Label converted to a ‘commission’ model. 
Continued strong growth in the independent specialist 
retailer channel
3. INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION: 
• International revenue grew at 36.2%  
(29.6% constant currency)
• Launched Childrenswear range in 55 Dillards 
department stores in the US
• Extended number of doors and product categories  
with Nordstrom 
• Further strengthened the team based in our  
New York showroom

400 stockists
4. PRODUCT EXTENSION: 
• Childrenswear category further developed  
with specific ranges for baby and younger  
and older age children

a range of Chelsea boots

FINANCIAL KPIs RETAIL: MULTI-CHANNEL PROGRESS
Retail sales, which includes stores, e-commerce and 
shows, grew by an impressive 19.4% during the year  
(19.4% in constant currency).  This reflected good growth 
from both stores and e-commerce, which increased by 
29.4% to now represent 34.8% of total retail revenue  
(FY16: 32.1%). 
The Group’s store coverage across the UK and ROI 
continued to expand to 108 stores at the end of the period 
(FY16: 97).  We opened 13 stores and closed two, with 10 
of the net new stores being opened during the first half 
of the year.  This expansion was in line with our previous 
guidance of 10-12 net new stores for the year.  During 
the period we also relocated three stores and extended a 
further three to provide larger sites that better reflect the 
Joules brand proposition, showcase our product range, and 
enable multi-channel activities such as ‘Click & Collect’ 
and ‘Order in Store’.  
This activity resulted in total selling space increasing 
to 135,000 square feet (FY16: 111,000 square feet) at the 
Period end.  The new openings were spread across our 
different store location types reflecting the breadth of 
appeal of the Joules brand:
• Lifestyle - Barnstaple;
• Local – Ashbourne, Ludlow, Woodbridge and Bishops 
Stortford; 
• High Street - Chelmsford and Stratford-upon-Avon; 
• Metro – Leeds, Derby, Bromley and Plymouth;
• Premium Outlet - Swindon and Bridgend.  
The average payback on new stores, opened for more 
than one year, remained at less than 12 months, and all 
continuing stores delivered a positive contribution.
The Group continued to develop its online offering 
following the successful relaunch of the e-commerce 
platform in September 2015.  In the period we added 
new functionality making it easier for our customers 
to shop and pay and continue to increase the use of 
personalisation.  Traffic from mobile and tablet devices 
continued to grow, representing over 75% of the total 
number of visitors and we continued to see improved 
conversion rates.  ‘Click & Collect’ and ‘Order in Store’ 
– where we completed the roll-out to stores in the first 
half of the year - continue to prove popular with our 
customers and demonstrate the importance of our multi-
channel model and ability to deliver an integrated and 
consistent experience across channels. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS REVIEW
WHOLESALE: UK AND INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION 
Wholesale revenue experienced further good growth, 
up by 20.3% (17.6% in constant currency) year on year to 
£44.8 million (FY16: £37.2m), as the Joules brand continues 
to resonate strongly with wholesale customers both in the 
UK as well as within our targeted international markets: 
North America and Germany.  
In the UK, wholesale expansion was driven through  
both national multi-channel retailers such as John  
Lewis and Next Label as well as through smaller, 
independent specialist retailers that have a good fit  
with the Joules brand.
Strong international wholesale growth helped to drive 
international sales (including international retail) up 36.2% 
(29.6% in constant currency) and they now represent 11.5% 
of total Group revenue.  This growth was underpinned 
by our proprietary hand-drawn prints, colour and British 
character as the Joules brand continues to resonate in 
international markets.  
In the US, we further expanded our presence in key 
department stores, with Dillards launching childrenswear 
for the Autumn/Winter 2016 season and Nordstrom 
increasing Joules’ product range listings and the number 
of doors in response to customers’ appetite for the brand.  
We continue to see exciting growth opportunities for the 
brand in the US market and during the year we started the 
process to bring the management of over 600 independent 
stockist accounts in-house, following the termination of 
our agreement with the third-party distributor that had 
previously been serving this channel.  This new way of 
working will become effective from the Spring/Summer 
2018 season and, under the management of our New York 
based sales and marketing team, will provide us with 
greater control over the long-term growth of the brand 
within the US.
In Germany we continued to perform in line with 
expectations and experienced good growth in the 
independent retailer segment where we now have  
over 400 stockists.

DEVELOPMENT AS A LIFESTYLE BRAND 
Joules delivered sales growth across product categories 
with a particularly strong performance in the core 
womenswear category – with our distinctive and colourful 
“Right as Rain” outerwear and “Warm Welcome” coats and 
gilets all proving particularly popular with our customers.  
Further development of our footwear and childrenswear 
categories also contributed to the strong growth. 
We continued to progress the development of our 
childrenswear range from baby through to toddler,  
younger and older girls and boys.  Notable highlights in  
the year included our colourful ponchos, fun applique  
tops and beautifully designed dresses.  Our childrenswear  
range is becoming increasingly popular with our 
international customers.
Our footwear offer continued to expand with good growth 
from our very popular leather Chelsea boot range and an 
increased range of wellington boot styles and designs.
Whilst licencing remains a small contributor to the Group, 
we are focused on continuing to build the brand through 
careful expansion with licensed partners for home - 
including bedding; toiletries; and eyewear.  These product 
categories continue to perform well and highlight the 
exciting licence income potential available to the brand 
where we are able to identify opportunities that appeal to 
our customers and align with Joules’ distinctive values.  
CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT
Joules has a loyal and highly engaged customer community.  
Active customers, defined as customers who have 
purchased in the last twelve months, increased 14% against 
the prior year to 907,000 supported by effective marketing 
and CRM campaigns, and our total customer database now 
stands at 2.5 million.  One example of a customer campaign, 
was our hugely successful ‘pass the parcel’ competition 
which we ran on the Joules Facebook channel in December 
2016.  The campaign encouraged potential and existing 
customers to unwrap a virtual present to potentially win a 
prize including a weekend stay at The Watergate Bay Hotel 
as well as Joules goodies.  Customers were able to ‘pass the 
parcel’ onto a friend through social media, attracting new 
prospective customers to the brand.  
Another notable and successful multi-channel campaign 
was our ‘win a Joules caravan’ competition that ran from 
February to April 2017 and attracted approximately 135,000 
new and existing customers to take part and enter a 
prize draw to win a luxury caravan decorated externally 
with Joules prints and kitted out inside from the Joules 
homeware and bedding range.  The campaign, which 
attracted a lot of social media engagement, was run on 
Facebook, the Joules website and by pitching the caravan  
at several of our country shows and events.  
One of Joules’ key competitive advantages is our very 
strong customer connection and their engagement with the 
Joules brand.  During the year we appointed our first Chief 
Customer Officer to help further develop our capability in 
this area and to increase brand awareness, customer loyalty 
and value across all channels.
PLATFORM FOR LONG TERM GROWTH
The Group’s strategy and focus is aimed towards the long 
term and sustainable development of the Joules brand.  We 
continue to invest in our stores, infrastructure, systems 
and people to deliver this. 
During the year we invested in our US operations by 
strengthening our US wholesale sales team, trade 
showroom and IT systems.  This has supported the 
development of new and existing department store 
accounts during the year as well as facilitating the 
transition of managing the independent stockist channel 
in-house, which we are confident will support our long 
term growth in the US market. 
Phase two of our company-wide ERP replacement 
programme continued through the year, with migration 
to the Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP platform scheduled 
for FY18.  This represents a significant investment for the 
Group and will bring benefits including enhanced stock 
management across channels, process efficiencies and 
simplification of the IT environment.
The creativity, skill and commitment of the Joules team 
are key to the brand’s continued success.  We continue to 
invest in skills and people development in all areas of the 
business including our customer facing colleagues and team 
leaders across the business. 
Since the year-end we have completed the acquisition 
of the freehold for a new head office premises.  The new 
site, which is located very close to our existing head 
office in Market Harborough, includes an existing 30,000 
square foot office building and development land to 
support future growth.  We expect to commence partial 
occupation towards the end of FY18 following a period of 
refurbishment.  This investment will further strengthen 
our brand values and culture and create a flexible space 
to support modern ways of working across our head office 
teams.  It is an important step to support the next phase  
of growth whilst solidifying our local roots and heritage.
