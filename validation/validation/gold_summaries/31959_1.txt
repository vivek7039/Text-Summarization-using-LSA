CEO STATEMENT
A Strong Platform for Growth 
Following Transformational Change
2017 was a year of significant change for Bowleven. Having substantially 
reduced the operating costs and maintained a strong balance sheet, 
the Company is well positioned to develop its assets. 
whilst continuing to scrutinise work programme costs 
and exercise capital discipline wherever possible.
Our capital discipline is underpinned by a strong 
financial position, which will remain a recurring 
theme into next year. With a strong cash 
balance and a deferred consideration structure 
in place post completion of the Etinde farm-
out transaction, no debt or outstanding work 
programme commitments, the Group is well placed 
financially to progress its existing asset base.
The prolonged downturn in the industry is creating 
opportunities for Bowleven by providing the ability 
to access lower development costs for its assets 
and to continue to challenge cost efficiency in the 
investment cycle. With its robust financial position, 
Bowleven is in an ideal position to capitalise on 
these opportunities as they arise. We remain 
determined and committed to challenging costs and 
proper capital allocation in operational delivery.
The farm-in agreement with VOG in respect of the 
Bomono licence area, has de-risked our funding 
obligations whilst retaining some long-term ability to 
extract some shareholder value, notwithstanding the 
reduction in the Group’s share of the asset. However, 
contractual terms of the farm-in as agreed by the 
previous Board provide limited financial value for the 
80% of the asset transferred to VOG, and efforts 
continue to mitigate the associated contingent liabilities. 
Our discussions with VOG to date have suggested 
that there are limited prospects of negotiating 
more favourable commercial terms. Should the 
farm-in arrangement with VOG not complete, 
the Group will not be in a position to present the 
Government with an alternative development plan 
for the licence area in the remaining time before the 
existing agreement terminates in December 2018.
Furthermore, there is a risk that the Government will 
not approve a further extension to the Exploration 
Authorisation. In which case, any Provisional 
Exploitation Authorisation (PEA) would cease 
to be valid. Therefore, when considering these 
risks as a whole, the Board deems it unlikely that 
the Government will seek to extend the existing 
licence any further at the current time without 
attaching additional work commitments.
As an incoming CEO, considerable effort was spent 
in engaging stakeholders to ensure the disruptive 
start to 2017 would result in a positive transformative 
change. Whilst the work is ongoing, Bowleven now 
has in place a fit-for-purpose organisation and 
business model that has the potential to deliver 
shareholder value into 2018 and beyond. 
The Board has strongly supported the turnaround 
agenda, and within a short period, the Company 
right-sized its cost base, initiated a more 
disciplined approach towards capital allocation 
and retained the capacity to deliver meaningful 
progress in its Etinde and Bomono assets. 
With a small central team we have been able to 
leverage our stakeholder relationships to navigate 
the complexity of these acreage developments 
with a view to delivering value from our assets. 
This focus has delivered the positive progress made 
with Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH) in 
Etinde, which has indicated support for the appraisal 
drilling programme that supports an economically 
viable Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) scheme. 
In Bomono, we have maintained the farm-in option 
with Victoria Oil & Gas Plc (VOG), which allows 
us to leverage their infrastructure, but as a non-
operator. Key to our business model is partnering,  Bowleven plc

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Given the ongoing negotiations and fundamental 
uncertainties, the recoverable amount of the 
Bomono asset has been determined to be zero at 
the current time, resulting in an impairment charge 
of $45.6m (2016: $61.0m) in the income statement 
as detailed in note 9 of the financial statements.
The focus on reducing G&A costs through 
organisational and work process efficiencies was 
taken to a new level towards the end of the financial 
year. The ongoing costs savings will significantly 
reduce the Group’s Corporate G&A footprint in 
both the UK and Cameroon. The Board is now 
focused on agreeing similar G&A efficiencies with 
the Operator of the Etinde asset. The outlook 
for Etinde is encouraging, and as the proposed 
appraisal well drilling programme materialises, this 
has important implications for the Company.
Outlook
Much progress has been made and the benefits 
of the relentless effort will be clearer into 2018. 
The task in hand is clear. We are determined 
to protect cash, maintain capital discipline and 
optimise the value and return from our assets. 
We will continue to focus on a strategy that preserves 
our financial robustness within the context of 
developing our assets in a manner that manages 
the risks and creates value over the longer term. 
The potentially transformational Etinde appraisal 
drilling campaign during 2018 will enable us to 
further define the asset monetisation route for this 
potentially world-class asset. The operating model 
is fit-for-purpose and I look forward to FY2018 
and beyond as we grow shareholder value.

Near- T erm Business Objectives
Maximise the value of Etinde
 — Ensure the appraisal drilling is carried out as 
soon as possible
Secure early cash flows from Bomono
 — Secure the PEA and obtain Government approval 
for the farm-out
 — Complete the farm-out to VOG on agreeable 
terms
 — Following farm-out, further appraisal/
exploration opportunities may follow under 
VOG’s development plans
Grow the company through new ventures
 — Ensure cash is wisely invested to cover our 
G&A costs
 — Focus in the short term on progressing Etinde 
and Bomono, thereafter, possibly consider new

A disciplined 
approach to cost, 
strict capital 
allocation, working 
with the right 
stakeholders to 
unlock Etinde asset 
monetisation and 
de-risking Bomono 
will deliver long-term 
shareholder value.
