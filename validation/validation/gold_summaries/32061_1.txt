 Dear	Shareholder,
This	year	will	stand	out	as	being	transformational	in	the	development	
of	Van	Elle.	We	successfully	joined	AIM,	the	junior	market	of	the	
London	Stock	Exchange,	on	26	October	2016	after	extensive	
preparations.	This	step	is	important	for	the	Group	as	not	only	does	
it	give	us	access	to	equity	capital	markets	as	we	seek	to	grow the	
business,	but	it	has	also	resulted	in	enhanced	governance	and	
improved	discipline,	which	we	implemented	in	preparation	
for our IPO.	
You	have	already	heard	from	our	Chairman	on the	appointments	
to the	Board	and	the	corporate	governance	report	details	many	
of the	changes	and	improvements	that	have	already	been	made.	
I would	also	like	to	echo	the	words	of	our	Chairman	and	take	this	
opportunity	to	thank	our	founders,	Michael	and	Joan,	for	their	vision	
and	hard	work	over	the	last	33	years	and	to	reassure	them	that	the	
business	is	in	safe	hands	as	they	enjoy	their	well	earned	retirement.
Delivering the strategy
Van	Elle’s	strategy	can	be	framed,	quite	simply,	as	“Driving	
Profitable	Growth”.	We	aim	to	grow	the	business	by	broadening	
our range	of	products	and	services	and	extending	our	geographical	
footprint	into	high‑growth	markets.	This	will	be	achieved	both	
organically	and	selectively	through	acquisitions.
Capital	investment	has	been	a	key	driver	of	our	growth	with	a	further	
£11.8m	spent	in	the	current	year	bringing	the	total	to	£31.5m	over	
the	last	three	years.	Our	rig	fleet	now	stands	at	111	rigs	(2016: 98 rigs)	
and	we	believe	that	Van	Elle	has	the	broadest	and	most	modern	
range	of	specialist	piling	rigs	in	the	market.	Some	of	our	recent	
additions	and	innovations	are	detailed	within	the	strategic	
overview on page 13. 
Following	our	successful	move	into	rail	infrastructure	and	after	
swiftly	becoming	one	of	the	sectors	leading	on‑track	ground	
engineering	specialists,	we	have	recently	completed	works	on	our	
new	test	track	located	at	our	Kirkby‑in‑Ashfield	site.	As	one	of	the	
largest	privately	owned	specialist	facilities	in	the	country,	it	is	
designed	to	enable	us to test	equipment,	develop	new	techniques	
and	practice	for	complex	projects.	There	is no	other	UK	specialist	
putting	such	time and	resource	into	developing	innovative	
solutions	for	the	UK’s rail	network.
As	part	of	our	continued	development,	the	Group	is	launching	
its own	training	academy	to	deliver	an	unequalled	standard	of	
training	to	all	industry	professionals	and	companies.	Our	brand	
new state‑of‑the‑art,	purpose‑built	training	facility	is	due	for	
completion	late	summer	2017.
To	extend	our	geographical	footprint,	we	have	recently	invested	
in a new	factory,	offices	and	a	maintenance	depot	in	Blantyre	
near Glasgow.	We	often	work	on	large	schemes	in	Scotland	and

	precast	ground	beams	locally	will	
ensure	that	mobilisation	costs	are	minimised	whilst	also	delivering	
environmental	benefits,	which	is	key	for	our	housebuilding	partners.	
We	are	always	looking	for	ways	in	which	we	can	improve	and	we	
see	this	commitment	to	Scotland	as	the	next	step	in	delivering	a	
truly	comprehensive	service	for	years	to	come.
We	continue	to	pursue	acquisition	opportunities	and	discussions	are	
ongoing	with	several	interested	parties.	We	have	discounted	certain	
targets	due	to	unrealistic	price	expectations	and	lack	of	fit;	however,	
there	remains	a	positive	pipeline	of	good opportunities.
Trading performance
I	am	pleased	that	we	successfully	grew	revenues	by	11.8%	in	
the year	to	£94.1m	(2016:	£84.2m),	our fourth	successive	year	of	
double‑digit	revenue	growth.	UK	construction	output	grew	by	2.2%	
for	the	same	period,	reflecting	our	view	that	we	continue	to	grow	our	
market	share.	We	also	maintained	our	record	of	profitable	growth	
since	2010.	We	report	in detail	on	the	financial	performance	of	
Van Elle	during	the	year	on pages	30	to	33.
In	terms	of	our	performance	in	the	end	markets,	sales	to	the	
housebuilding	sector	were	up	24.4%	to	£42.5m	(2016:	£34.2m)	and 
infrastructure	sector	were	up	17.3%	to	£28.9m	(2016:	£24.6m).	Sales to 
the	commercial	and	industrial	sector	reduced	by	17.0%	to £18.8m	
(2016:	£22.7m)	which	was,	in	part	a	reflection	of	some	short‑term	
market	uncertainty	and	the	deferral	or	cancellation	of several	
projects	but also	reflects	the	completion	of	several	large	education	
and	retail	projects	by	the	Company	in	the	previous	year.	The	ability	
to	redirect	resources	to	reflect	short‑term	trends	in	our	markets	is	a	
key strength	of	the	business,	mitigating	the	impact of	a	slowdown	
in any one sector.
As	we	reported	in	March	2017,	the	Group	experienced	a	challenging	
period	in	its	rail	business	during	the	fourth	quarter	with	the	start	
dates	for	several	contracts	delayed	and	expected	call‑off	and	work	
distribution	schedules	revised.	Whilst	we	have	seen	some	encouraging	
signs	of	stabilisation	in	the	market,	and	remain	confident	in	the	
long‑term	structural	growth	opportunity	in	rail,	we	are	remaining	
cautious	as	to	the	near‑term	outlook	for	the	sector.
Operating performance
Sales	have	grown	in	each	of	our	operating	segments,	with	a	particularly	
strong	performance	in	Ground	Engineering	Products,	up	71.2%	to	
£10.4m	(2016:	£6.1m).	This	has	been	driven	by	a	significant	increase	
in	demand	for	Smartfoot
®
 as well as additional precast concrete 
products	and	our	additional	investment	in	manufacturing	capacity	
has	enabled	this demand	to	be	met.
Sales	growth	was	also	strong	in	Specialist	Piling,	up	16.6%	to	£30.1m	
(2016:	£25.8m),	enabled	by	our	investment	in	several	specialist	rigs	
and	equipment	during	the	year.	The	restricted	access	business	performed 
strongly,	including	securing	its	largest	ever	contract	at	Eden	Brows.	
The division’s	profit	result	though	was	adversely	impacted	by	the	
weaker‑than‑expected	performance	in	the	higher	margin	rail	business	
during	the	fourth	quarter.
General	Piling	has	seen	sales	growth	in	the	year,	up	1.9%	to	£42.9m	
(2016:	£42.1m),	a	result	of	the	healthy	housebuilding	sector	offset	by	
reduced	demand	for	industrial	and	commercial	work.	Divisional	gross	
margin	remained	strong	at	32%	(2016:	31%),	reflecting	the	Group’s	
ability	to	deliver	a	large	number	of	contracts	across	a	broad	range	of	
end	markets,	achieving	good	returns	through	its	long‑standing	and	
effective	operational	model.	
Ground	Engineering	Services	has	increased	its	sales	by	4.6%	
to £10.6m	(2016:	£10.2m),	boosted	by	the establishment	
of a stand‑alone	operation	in	Scotland	during	January	2017.
Further	details	of	the	operational	performance	of	each	division	are	
included	in	the	operating	review	on	pages	22	to	29	and	in	note	5	
of the	consolidated	financial	statements.	
Outlook
Trading	in	the	new	financial	year	has	started	well	and	is	in	line	with	
our	expectations.	We	are	seeing	opportunities	with	each	of	our	
markets	as	we	continue	our	strategy	of	broadening	our	range	of	
products	and	services.	We	continue	to	actively	monitor	conditions	
in	our	core	markets	and,	whilst	mindful	of	the	risks	posed	by	any	
sustained	period	of	political	or	economic	uncertainty,	we	are	
cautiously	optimistic	for	further	progress	in	the	year	ahead.
I	continue	to	believe	that,	with	our	growth	strategy	described	above,	
Van	Elle	is	well	positioned	to	deliver	further	value	to	shareholders	
in the	year	ahead.
