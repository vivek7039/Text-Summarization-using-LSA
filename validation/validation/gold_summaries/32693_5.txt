Customers require  
a basket of goods

million customers across the Group and 
customers typically require a basket of 
goods. In the USA the average basket 
size is ﬁve products valued at circa $600.
Customers’ needs are local 
The customer base is fragmented. 
Professional contractors typically operate 
within about 20 miles of a local branch 
and may visit it several times per week. 
In addition to visiting branches, they 
are now using digital channels which 
complement their working patterns. 
Large supplier base 
Ferguson distributes the products 
of approximately 44,000 suppliers 
across the world. 
Clear need for distributors 
in the supply chain 
Distributors including Ferguson 
bridge the gap between a fragmented 
supplier base and the large and 
geographically dispersed professional 
customer base. 
Highly fragmented industry 
with no market dominated 
by a single player 
Our markets are typically highly 
fragmented, with few large 
players in the industry. 
Beneﬁts of scale

can perform better through the 
economic cycle and customers have 
quicker access to products. 
Strong organic  
growth opportunities 
Market characteristics  
support long-term organic 
growth opportunities.

opportunities
