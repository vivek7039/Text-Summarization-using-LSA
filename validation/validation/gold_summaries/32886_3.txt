 Strategic Report
A Note  
from Our Chairman
In 2017, your Company delivered very encouraging op-
erational and financial performance despite the ongo-
ing macroeconomic challenges in our primary market. 
We also expanded our footprint in Africa in early 2018 
with a key strategic investment in Nigeria that will 
broaden our diagnostic services suite beyond pathology 
to include radiology. 
We have seen more sustainable macroeconomic stability 
in Egypt. Whilst inflationary pressures persist, the Gov-
ernment has been implementing a robust programme of 
reforms that has resulted in stronger economic growth 
and led to increased foreign direct investment with the 
improvement in general confidence. The Central Bank of 
Egypt (CBE)’s floatation of the Egyptian pound in Novem-
ber 2016, with the ensuing lifting of capital controls, has 
freed up the foreign exchange market, thus improving the 
ease of doing business in the country.     
Despite the ongoing inflationary headwinds, IDH main-
tained both our profit margins and market share. The 
well-entrenched strength of our brands and supplier 
relationships enabled our management to successfully 
execute our business model. We are naturally delighted 
by the recovery in our stock price. Your management are 
constantly seeking to consolidate and maintain the prof-
itability of the business with the provision of additional 
value-added services. With our long-established presence 
in Egypt, together with our loyal patient base, we have 
built a considerable base of patient data whilst at all times 
maintaining strict confidentiality and privacy.
We remain committed to fulfilling our business strategy 
through expanding our geographical footprint in other 
countries, both in Africa and in the Middle East. We are 
delighted by the growth and strength of our subsidiaries in 
Jordan and Sudan, which have successfully implemented 
our business model. With the lifting of longstanding US 
sanctions on Sudan, the outlook for that country has im-
proved markedly.  
We remain committed to 
fulfilling our business strategy 
through expanding our 
geographical footprint — both 
in Africa and in the Middle East
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 10 With Nigeria having by far the largest population in Africa, 
we are keen to expand our presence in that country. We 
shall be building on our recent investment in Echo-Scan, 
a network of radiology and diagnostic laboratories that 
has provided us with an attractive entry point into the 
country. With its fragmented and largely unestablished 
healthcare services market, we see huge potential for fu-
ture growth to match our successful track record in Egypt. 
We are proud to be investing in Nigeria alongside Man 
Capital LLC and the IFC.
We are very cognisant that as we expand the geographical 
reach of our emerging market platform, we must maintain 
our high standards of operational excellence and ensure 
that our balance sheet remains strong and resilient. In 
2017, we also focused on strengthening our senior finan-
cial management team, and this year we will undertake 
a comprehensive review of all aspects of our human 
resources management so as to entrench and ensure 
sustainable performance at all levels of the organisation.
We are at an advanced stage in building and completing 
our new corporate headquarters in Cairo, where consoli-
dating our offices will greatly facility the daily interaction 
of our staff.  
In conclusion, your Board and management are com-
mitted to maintaining strong corporate governance and 
promoting corporate social responsibility whilst under-
pinning our business model with the highest standards 
of accountability and transparency, thus fulfilling the 
expectations of our shareholders.
