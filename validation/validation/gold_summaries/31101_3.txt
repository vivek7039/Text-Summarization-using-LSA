OVERVIEW 
Both of our prime central London estates had a very active year in 
which management made good operational progress. The Covent 
Garden estate, which now represents more than 70 per cent of the 
Group’s portfolio by value, delivered positive performance and value 
growth. The value of our investments at Earls Court has however 
been impacted by challenges in the London residential market.
PERFORMANCE 
Capco’s total shareholder return for the year, which comprises 
share price performance plus the dividends paid during the year, 
was 8.1 per cent, and total return for the year, which represents the 
change in net assets plus the dividends paid during the year, was 
-1.3 per cent. The total value of Capco’s property portfolio fell by 0.9 
per cent on a like-for-like basis to £3.5 billion, with gains at Covent 
Garden being offset by a reduction in the Earls Court valuation. 
Covent Garden is established as a renowned retail and dining 
destination and continues to attract target brands. The Covent 
Garden estate is benefiting from a period of significant investment 
made over recent years, creating an inviting environment with a 
wide variety of British heritage, independent and global brands 
offering a broad selection of retail and dining experiences across  
the estate. Net rental income has increased significantly in 2017. 
Capco’s distinct approach to creative asset management continues 
to drive leasing activity and in turn ERV progression. 
Initiatives to enhance the estate have been very successful. 
Examples include the establishment of Henrietta Street as a 
menswear and dining destination and the successful repositioning 
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 8  of the Royal Opera House Arcade. In addition, a number of 
acquisitions have extended our presence on Floral Street. The 
Floral Court development is nearing completion with the courtyard 
and restaurant openings expected over the coming months. 
Economic and political uncertainty has impacted the residential 
market in London, resulting in a further decline in the valuation  
of our investments at Earls Court. The consented Masterplan 
remains one of the largest Opportunity Areas in central London 
with the ability to evolve with the needs of the Capital. The political 
and economic environment has made discussions on enhancing the 
Masterplan more difficult, however Capco will continue to seek to 
positively engage with all stakeholders to evolve the Masterplan 
over time.
At Earls Court Partnership Limited (“ECPL”), our investment 
vehicle with Transport for London (“TfL”), the final phase of the 
complex demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres 
has been successfully completed in preparation for future 
development. Handover of the first phase of the Lillie Square 
residential development nears completion and half of Phase 2 has 
been pre-sold at a modest premium to comparable units in Phase 1. 
In April 2017, Capco completed the sale of the Venues business at a 
slight premium to net asset value, in keeping with our established 
strategy of recycling capital through the disposal of non-core assets. 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND DIVIDENDS 
Capco continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, with low 
leverage, high liquidity and modest capital commitments. During 
the year, Capco extended its debt maturities, further diversified its 
sources of funding with a Private Placement and successfully 
executed the sale of Venues. The business is well-positioned to 
support its future activities and take advantage of opportunities  
as they arise. 
The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share, 
which brings the total dividend for 2017 to 1.5 pence per share. 
PEOPLE 
The Company has evolved during the year and the Board and I 
would like to thank our employees for their work and commitment.
There were a number of changes to the Board in 2017. At the 
beginning of the year Situl Jobanputra was promoted to Chief 
Financial Officer, following Soumen Das’ departure at the end of 
2016. Charlotte Boyle was appointed as a Non-executive Director 
and member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees in 
October 2017, following Demetra Pinsent’s decision to step down 
from the Board in July 2017.
I am pleased to report that Situl and Charlotte have both settled 
into their new roles well, and I was delighted to see the recognition 
of internal talent. Demetra’s departure unfortunately sets back our 
gender diversity aspirations at Board level. The Board will consider 
this along with wider diversity for any future appointments and is 
committed to encouraging diversity, inclusiveness and the 
development of our people across the business.
SHAREHOLDERS 
Capco is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the JSE, and  
over 50 per cent of the Company’s shares are held by South African 
investors. There are sometimes different market expectations in  
the UK and South Africa, and one example of this is the level of 
authority to issue new shares that shareholders expect to grant to 
Boards. The Board feels that, to preserve flexibility, it is appropriate 
to seek the conventional level of authorities expected by 
shareholders in UK listed companies where possible. This has 
resulted in significant votes against two of our AGM resolutions 
and Capco’s inclusion in The Investment Association’s public 
register of shareholder dissent. The Board will maintain dialogue 
with our South African shareholders on this topic. 
BOARD OVERSIGHT 
Non-executive Directors are encouraged to visit our assets in 
Covent Garden and Earls Court and meet operational management 
regularly. This is achieved through individual visits and Board 
update meetings sometimes held on site, and helps the Board keep 
abreast of the business’ challenges and opportunities and to 
contribute to strategic debate. This has been a year of considerable 
change in the macroeconomic and political context in which Capco 
operates and I am grateful for the Directors’ diligence and 
engagement throughout the year.
In reaching its conclusions regarding key business decisions, the 
Board takes account of the different stakeholders relevant to Capco 
and its activities, including local communities where we operate, 
partners, lenders, government and our own people as well as 
shareholders.
The Board also regularly reviews the changing risks affecting Capco 
and takes account of changes to risks when discussing strategy and 
reviewing operations. Health and Safety receives particular 
attention at Board meetings and across the business. 
LOOKING AHEAD 
London is an outstanding global city and remains a very attractive 
investment arena. Our strategy remains clear and focused on 
delivering long-term value for shareholders from our two prime 
central London estates. The Board remains alert to broader 
economic and political uncertainty and its potential impact on 
market conditions, however Capco’s strong financial position 
enables the Group to support its future activities and provides the 
financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
