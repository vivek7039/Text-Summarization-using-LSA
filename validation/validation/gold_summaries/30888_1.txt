 Chief Executive’s Review
Results overview
Reported sales increased by 13% to £1,525.6 million (2016: 
£1,345.8 million) which reflected a 6% increase on an organic, 
constant currency (like-for-like, ‘LFL’)
1
 basis. During the year, we 
continued to make good strategic progress towards broadening  
our portfolio, adding further to our software and services offerings. 
As customers increasingly require an integrated solution, we are 
strategically positioning Spectris to align with their needs and this  
is transforming our business. 
2017 operational performance
An improving demand backdrop in some of the key industries we 
serve has been an important factor behind the 6% increase in LFL 
sales which, combined with 2% net growth from acquisitions and 
disposals and a beneficial impact of 5% from foreign currency 
exchange movements, produced a 13% increase in reported sales. 
LFL sales increased across all four segments and key regions.  
In Materials Analysis, a recovery in metals, minerals and mining plus 
good growth in pharma and semiconductor saw LFL sales increase 
7% whilst automotive was the key sector driving the growth in  
Test and Measurement. Sales to academic research in both these 
segments were lower year-on-year. For In-line Instrumentation, 
the recovery of capital spending in energy and utilities and process 
industries led to higher LFL sales whilst Industrial Controls benefited 
from an improved performance at Omega as well as an ongoing 
recovery in North American industrial spending.
On a regional basis, LFL sales to North America increased by 4%, 
with the second half performance stronger than the first half.  
In Asia, LFL sales continued to grow strongly (up 9%), helped 
particularly by China which grew 11%, along with Japan and India. 
In Europe, LFL sales rose 6%, with a strong second half contribution 
from the UK while sales to Germany grew strongly in the first half. 
Sales to the Rest of the world were up 1%.
Adjusted operating profit increased 11% to £223.5 million  
and reported operating profit was £182.4 million compared  
to £38.3 million recorded in 2016 which included a non-cash 
impairment charge of £115.3 million. On a LFL basis, adjusted 
operating profit increased 8%, primarily reflecting the effect of the 
higher sales volumes and a turnaround in performance at Omega, 
partly offset by adverse product mix and overhead cost increases, 
reflecting increased headcount, wage inflation and the cost to 
achieve our strategic growth initiatives. LFL overheads will continue 
to increase in 2018 at a similar rate to that in 2017, reflecting 
inflationary pressures together with the annualisation of the costs  
of our strategic initiatives which commenced in 2017.
Adjusted operating profit includes costs of £15.8 million in relation 
to Project Uplift. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating margins 
were 15.7%, 0.5pp higher than in 2016 (LFL +1.1pp). Reported 
operating profit included a number of one-off costs and income 
during the year resulting in a net overheads year-on-year benefit  
of £3.5 million.
The Group’s adjusted operating cash conversion was in line with 
our expectations with 75% (2016: 113%) of adjusted operating 
profit being converted into cash. This was lower than usual due  
to increased capital expenditure for the capacity expansion 
programme at Millbrook, resulting in an overall Group capital 
expenditure of £73.1 million. After allowing for the proceeds from 
the divestment of Microscan, net debt stood at £50.5 million at  
the year end, around 0.2 times the full-year adjusted EBITDA.
Executing our
STRATEGY
1. Adjusted performance measures (‘APMs’) are used consistently throughout 
this Report and are referred to as ‘adjusted’, ‘constant exchange rate’ or 
‘like-for-like (LFL)’. These are defined in full and reconciled to the reported 
statutory measures in Note 2 to the Financial Statements.
10 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report capacity in Finland, which is due to be commissioned in the third 
quarter of 2018. 
We will also be adding capability through the joint venture 
agreement we signed with Macquarie Capital in which they have 
agreed to acquire a 50% interest in our environmental monitoring 
business, EMS Brüel & Kjær. It is expected to close in the second 
quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals in China, the 
European Union and South Korea. This partnership, with a 
world-leading infrastructure adviser and investor, should benefit  
the new joint venture in its next stage of development as we jointly 
invest organically and inorganically to collaborate on our remote 
monitoring and analytics offering for environmental monitoring. 
The combination of our expertise in environmental monitoring 
solutions and Macquarie Capital’s significant presence in 
infrastructure markets will accelerate the growth of the business. 
In January 2018, we acquired Concept Life Sciences, which  
provides integrated drug discovery, development, analytical  
testing and environmental consultancy services, mainly in the 
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrochemical and environmental 
sectors. Additionally, it carries out development and analytical 
services for the food, consumer and environmental industries. 
Concept Life Sciences is a high-quality services business which 
further strengthens our portfolio, has strong synergies with the 
activities of Malvern Panalytical and enhances our ability to provide 
customers within the pharmaceutical, life sciences and advanced 
materials sectors with a combined product and service proposition. 
Our performance in 2017 was 
good, with like-for-like increases 
in both sales and profit as we 
executed on our strategy, and 
helped by a recovery in the USA 
and certain key end markets.

Chief Executive
Positioning ourselves to deliver  
our solutions strategy
Our strategy is evolving towards the provision of complete solutions 
to our customers, based on our deep application and technical 
expertise, and we made good progress in broadening our software 
and services offerings to customers. 
Corporate development
We completed a number of bolt-on acquisitions in 2017. Setpoint 
brings conditioning monitoring hardware and software solutions 
for rotating and reciprocating machinery, allowing online condition 
monitoring analysis and machinery diagnostics, and has been 
integrated into Brüel & Kjær Vibro to enhance its product offering. 
Omnicon provides a range of services and software to help its 
customers analyse and improve product reliability and safety, 
particularly in aerospace, automotive, transportation and defence. 
The combination of Omnicon’s expertise in reliability design and 
testing with HBM Prenscia’s software and services will enable  
us to provide customers with a broader range of reliability-
improvement solutions.
We further strengthened the Millbrook business in the UK with  
the acquisition of the CSA Leyland Technical Centre, an automotive 
test facility in Lancashire which adds further capacity as well as a 
complementary customer base and services. In addition, we 
invested £25.5 million at Millbrook predominantly on new capacity, 
such as the 4WD climatic emissions chassis dynamometer cell  
which we commissioned in the year, and additional indoor testing 
11 Spectris plc Strategic initiatives
In order to drive our strategic initiatives, we have made a number of 
investments including new central leadership appointments in lean, 
supply chain, software and digital. Ensuring we have best-in-class 
processes and capabilities will be key to our continued success and 
these new roles will be pivotal in developing best practice and 
driving performance enhancement across the Group. This will be 
supported by our new central HR function with its talent 
management and organisational capability programme.
Across the Group, delivery of our strategy has meant more 
collaboration between our operating companies. Automotive is a 
key end-market focus and here we have strengthened our key 
account management approach and provided a more collaborative 
offering. This is based on our expertise in four key areas – durability, 
propulsion, safety and refinement – in order to cross-sell our 
products, software and services from Brüel & Kjær Sound & 
Vibration, HBM and Millbrook. 
At Malvern Panalytical, which we merged at the start of the year, 
there is now one management team and a combined sales and 
marketing team. Their collaboration has led to numerous  
cross-selling opportunities and, together with a more value-based 
approach to providing customer solutions, the combined business 
has made good progress during the year. 
We have also been reviewing our digital-led customer applications, 
with the potential for more cross-group solutions by leveraging 
existing operating company technologies, competencies and  
end-market expertise to more broadly serve our customers’ needs. 
New product development and our combination of hardware  
and software are focused on simplifying the integration of  
customer-generated data with remote data analytics services  
and in January 2018, we launched Spectris Advance to showcase 
this digital offering to customers. 
We decided to divest our machine vision technology business, 
Microscan, as we believe its next stage of development can be 
better fulfilled under new ownership. The Group completed the 
sale to Omron Corporation in October, resulting in post-tax cash 
proceeds of £91.9 million. Our balance sheet remains strong and 
provides the opportunity for us to redeploy capital to add further 
software and services capability. 
Project Uplift
Project Uplift continues to make progress, with Phase 1 fully 
underway. The majority of the Phase 1 savings will be derived from 
leveraging the Group’s scale, for instance through securing 
improved terms for procurement of goods and services, both direct 
and indirect. We made progress on this on a number of fronts 
during 2017; for example, we implemented new global freight 
contracts and are well advanced in the process of transitioning to 
new suppliers for a number of key product components. 
In 2017, the cost of £15.8 million and gross recurring benefit of 
£2.8 million were both lower than originally expected, and included 
an additional £1 million of spend on the Phase 2 shared service 
centre project. As we started to implement the initiatives during 
2017, it became evident that the IT implementation is more 
complex to deliver than we had anticipated and we have therefore 
revised the scope of the programme, resulting in a change in the 
magnitude and phasing of benefits and costs from those originally 
expected. As a result, for Phase 1, we now expect annualised 
recurring savings of £25 million and a total cost to achieve these  
of £35 million by the end of 2019, with more coming from 
procurement activities and less from IT. This compares to previous 
expectations of £35 million of savings and £45 million of costs.  
In 2018, the net benefit for Phase 1 is now expected to be  
£3 million. Work is again underway to affirm the potential benefits 
and costs of the shared service centre project in Phase 2 and we will 
provide further details on this later in 2018. Costs of £3-4 million 
related to this work will be incurred during 2018. 
As well as delivering the projected savings, the programme will 
further support our customer-focused solutions strategy, freeing up 
resources to facilitate the delivery of our strategy by identifying and 
capitalising on cross-group opportunities and making it easier for 
our customers to do business with us. 
Our people deliver the strategy
Ensuring we have the right people in place to deliver the strategy 
will continue to be a key focus. As our business evolves and there is 
more co-ordination across operating companies, it is critical that we 
retain the factors that have driven our success, preserving the 
entrepreneurial and dynamic nature of the Group, as well as 
continuing to promote our strong ethical culture and values. In 
2017, there has been a notable step forward in our leadership 
talent management process and this will continue to be a key focus 
linked to our future strategy and operating model. 
Summary and outlook 
Our performance in 2017 was good, with LFL increases in both  
sales and profit as we executed on our strategy, and helped by  
a recovery in the USA and certain key end markets. In 2018,  
we expect to see the benefit of organic sales growth, partly  
offset by the investment in our strategic growth initiatives and 
foreign currency exchange headwinds. 
We remain focused on increasing productivity and reducing 
complexity through Project Uplift. The magnitude and phasing  
of the benefits and costs from this programme have varied from 
those originally envisaged, primarily due to a re-scoping of the  
IT project. As a result, we now expect Phase 1 to deliver annual 
savings of £25 million at a total cost of £35 million over the period 
to the end of 2019. 
Our key priority remains the implementation of the strategy  
to provide a broader offering to our customers. Our balance  
sheet remains strong and we will continue to make acquisitions  
to support this strategy as we expand our software and  
services capability.
