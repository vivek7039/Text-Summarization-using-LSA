 2 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement
The culture we have created in the business and the structures that we operate give 
us huge confidence for our future.
Conviviality is a business whose strength lies in the combined skills and expertise 
of the enlarged group, “One Conviviality”, a business where the whole is greater 
than the sum of the parts and that has the firm foundations in place from which 
to grow. 
We look back on a year of unprecedented change politically and economically. 
Our business has also undergone unprecedented change throughout the past 
year. Following the acquisition of Matthew Clark on the 7th October 2015, 
Conviviality acquired Bibendum PLB Group on 20th May 2016, creating a one 
stop shop drinks solution for our customers and providing an opportunity to 
undertake a single integration programme. This integration has resulted in a full 
restructuring of the business, from a programme to generate significant buying 
synergies, the development of one Group Wine Buying team, to the development 
of the Group Logistics function. The acquisition of Bibendum PLB Group has 
enhanced the Group with additional wine expertise, access to the premium 
On Trade, particularly in London, and significant capability in consumer insight 
across the alcohol sector. 
I am proud that, against this backdrop the teams in all of the business units have 
stayed on track in integrating the business and ensuring that, first and foremost, 
our customers see the passion for their success and growth regardless of size of 
business and continue to benefit from the expertise of the combined group. As 
the UK economic and political environment remains uncertain, we believe that 
Conviviality has the flexibility to succeed through our unique model spanning 
both the On and Off Trade.
The Group is now structured into three Business Units: Conviviality Direct 
(wholesaler & distributor to On Trade) led by Mark Aylwin; Conviviality Retail 
(for Off Trade consumer businesses Bargain Booze, Select Convenience and 
Wine Rack) led by David Robinson; and Conviviality Trading (an innovative 
and dynamic approach to sourcing, ranging, brand building, merchandising, 
activation and events) led by James Lousada. Each of the business unit Managing 
Directors ensures their operation has the best people in the right place to deliver 
excellent service to customers and drive collaborations and savings across the 
Group. The Business Units are supported by the expertise of the Group functions 
of Logistics, Finance, Legal, IT and Human Resources. We believe that the recent 
acquisitions and new structure have resulted in Conviviality being well positioned 
in our market with a robust business model that provides a unique positioning 
with both our suppliers and our customers. 
The successful delivery of our strategy will depend on having great talent in 
the business in every area. We continue to invest significantly in training our 
colleagues and, in addition, we strengthen from outside of the Group where 
appropriate. In FY17 David Robinson joined us to head up Conviviality Retail 
and both David and Mark Aylwin (Managing Director, Conviviality Direct) were 
invited to join the Plc Board. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone working in our business 
for their passion, commitment and customer focus that has made it possible to 
deliver our acquisitions to plan while also delivering underlying growth across 
the business.
