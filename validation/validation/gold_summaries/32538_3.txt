 MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 8 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Last year I reported on the consistent growth of 
Mediclinic over the past 30 years, for which we are 
thankful. However, for the past fi nancial period, the fi rst 
full year following the Company’s listing on the London 
Stock Exchange, the Group was unable to deliver its 
consistent growth in underlying earnings per share 
achieved in the past, largely due to challenges in our 
Middle East platform.
Our expansion into Abu Dhabi, eff ectively doubling the 
size of the Middle East business following the Al Noor 
Combination, has not met our original expectations. 
Our growth forecasts for the Abu Dhabi operations 
were signifi cantly impacted in the short term due to 
unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment and 
a greater need to align Al Noor with the sustainable 
business and operational practices of the Mediclinic 
Group. As a result, revenue and underlying EBITDA 
margins during the year were lower than expected in 
the Middle East. Despite the challenges in Abu Dhabi, 
our established Dubai operations continued to perform 
well. The new Mediclinic City Hospital North Wing 
opened in the third quarter of the year and patient 
volumes have been encouraging. I remain confi dent in 
our approach to expansion in the region, and that it will 
deliver the required longer-term growth and returns 
for the Group.
In Switzerland and Southern Africa, our largest two 
operating platforms, we have seen good trading 
performances this year. The key metrics of patient 
admissions, theatre hours sold and revenue per bed 
day have all been positive. As I have stated before, this 
indicates positive trends in patient choice and shows 
that we are attracting and retaining suffi  cient doctors 
to support the business. This enables us to continue 
to focus on enhancing operational effi  ciencies. In the 
UK, our 29.9% investment in Spire Healthcare remained 
stable and continues to give us exposure to the UK 
private healthcare market. 
Overall, the Group remains in a solid fi nancial position. 
Group revenue for the year was up 30% at £2 749m 
(2016: £2 107m) and underlying EBITDA was up 17% 
at £501m (2016: £428m), both benefi ting from the 
translation eff ect of weaker Sterling and the addition 
of the Al Noor business to the Group. However, 
underlying earnings were fl at at £220m (2016: £219m) 
while underlying earnings per share were down 19% at 
29.8 pence (2016: 36.7 pence), both aff ected by the 
increase in fi nance costs and poor performance of

a transitional solution until the healthcare providers 
and funders agree on a revised tariff structure. The 
Federal Government is also preparing a framework 
for the outmigration of services (shift of basic medical 
treatments from the inpatient to the outpatient sector) 
across Switzerland.
In Southern Africa, we continue to engage with the 
South African Competition Commission in relation 
to the Health Market Inquiry which is undertaking a 
review of the private healthcare sector to understand 
whether there are features of the sector that prevent, 
distort or restrict competition, and how competition in 
the sector can be promoted. Over the longer term, the 
government in South Africa is hoping to address the 
shortcomings of the public healthcare system through 
the phased introduction of a National Health Insurance 
system over a 14-year period. 
Finally, in the Middle East, we saw the introduction 
in July 2016 of a 20% co-payment for Thiqa patients 
(those covered by health insurance for UAE 
Nationals or others of similar status in Abu Dhabi) 
using private facilities. This had a material impact on 
patient volumes and the financial performance of the 
business in Abu Dhabi. In April 2017, the co-payment 
in Abu Dhabi was waived with immediate effect.
BOARD ACTIVITY AND CHANGES 
Following the Mediclinic and Al Noor Combination and 
the Group’s listing on the London Stock Exchange in 
2016, I last year reported a number of Board changes. 
I am pleased to say that the new Board structure 
operated efficiently throughout the year. We continue 
to look at how to improve the composition and 
functioning of the Board.
In April 2016, Jannie Durand, a Non-executive Director 
of the Company and the Chief Executive Officer of 
Remgro Limited, our major shareholder, appointed 
Pieter Uys as his alternate. Since 2013, Pieter has 
held the position of Head of Strategic Investment at  
Remgro Limited. 
Jurgens Myburgh was appointed as the CFO of the 
Group on 1 August 2016, replacing Craig Tingle, who 
retired as announced in 2016. Prior to joining Mediclinic, 
Jurgens served as CFO at Datatec from June 2014, and 
before that at The Standard Bank of South Africa as 
Executive Vice President of Investment Banking, where 
“I firmly believe that we have the  
right strategy and people in place  
to enable us to consistently grow  
in the future as we have done over  
so many years.”
the Abu Dhabi business. Earnings per share were 
further impacted by the effect of additional shares 
issued for the Spire and Al Noor transactions.
In view of the financial results and following the review 
last year of the Group’s dividend policy to target a  
pay-out ratio of 25% to 30% of underlying earnings, 
the Board recommended a final dividend of 4.70 pence  
per share, bringing the total payment for the year to 
7.90 pence per share.
During the year under review, the clinical performance 
of the business was satisfactory across all operating 
platforms, and most patient safety and clinical 
effectiveness indicators showed improvement. 
In addition, many initiatives in support of clinical 
performance and quality improvement were launched 
and completed during the year. Highlights include:
• 
the strengthening of clinical services leadership  
at hospital and corporate level in Mediclinic 
Southern Africa; 
• 
close collaboration between Mediclinic Southern 
Africa and supporting doctors in certain disciplines; 
• 
the launch of patient reported outcomes after large 
joint surgery in Hirslanden; 
• 
progress on the implementation of an integrated 
care model in Hirslanden; 
• 
the establishment of a comprehensive cancer 
centre in Mediclinic Middle East; and 
• 
the selection of a new electronic health record 
system in Mediclinic Middle East. 
Much of the progress can be attributed to a strong 
collaborative effort between the clinical services teams 
of the respective platforms. 
REGULATORY LANDSCAPE 
The healthcare industry has always been highly 
regulated with continuous changes. We have always 
managed this successfully, thanks to the well-informed 
and responsible leadership of our management teams. 
However, this year has been particularly tough in all 
three of our operating platforms. 
In Switzerland, there was the proposed levy in the 
Canton of Zurich, which the Cantonal Parliament voted 
not to approve in March 2017. National outpatient 
tariffs (TARMED) remain under revision and the 
Federal Government has proposed adjustments as  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 10 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
he was involved in several major Mediclinic corporate 
transactions. Since joining the Board, Jurgens has 
made a number of signifi cant contributions to the 
business.
On 21 February 2017, Ian Tyler, the Company’s Senior 
Independent Director, resigned as a Director of the 
Company. Ian was previously Chairman of Al Noor, and 
we were delighted that he agreed to continue on the 
Board following the Combination in February 2016. 
However, Ian is a Board member of several LSE-listed 
companies and believed that it would be in the best 
interest of all parties to reduce his responsibilities. 
I would like to thank Ian for his important contribution 
to the Board during a very busy year for him. 
Desmond Smith was appointed as the new Senior 
Independent Director. He was appointed an 
Independent Non-executive Director of Mediclinic 
International Limited in 2008 and was the Lead 
Independent Director from 2010 until the Al Noor 
Combination took place.
PROSPECTS 
This year has highlighted, once again, the continued 
challenges and changing regulatory landscape in which 
we operate. Competition from the public and private 
sector means we must focus on continually improving 
the quality of our services while demonstrating value 
in the healthcare services we provide to patients, funders 
and governments alike. Despite these challenges, we 
operate in an industry where demand continues to grow 
for our services. The Board remains focused on creating 
long-term value for stakeholders and maintaining 
Mediclinic’s leading position in the international 
healthcare market. 
Having the services available of high-quality clinical, 
operational and support staff  is crucial to the 
long-term success of the business. Furthermore, by 
closely monitoring key indicators and gathering 
information, we continue to position the Group for 
sensible future growth. 
Mediclinic has been providing private healthcare 
services since 1983, and we have always taken a 
long-term view when we make investment decisions. 
The fundamentals of the healthcare industry remain 
positive, and I fi rmly believe that we have the right 
people and strategy in place to enable us to consistently 
grow in the future as we have done over so many years. 
APPRECIATING YOUR CONTINUED 
SUPPORT 
As ever, I want to express my sincere thanks to 
everyone who contributed to Mediclinic’s continued 
success, including our Directors, management, doctors, 
nurses and support staff . In particular, the support of 
patients and medical professionals is absolutely vital 
to the sustainability of our business, and we deeply 
appreciate that they have chosen Mediclinic as their 
preferred healthcare partner.
Finally, I would like to extend a special thank you to all 
our shareholders for their confi dence in us.
