 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 6
Chief Executive’s Review
n 2017, the Group continued its 
strategy to focus on developing its 
unique proprietary content, ‘Slingo 
Originals’, and achieve a positive 
Adjusted EBITDA result.
Real Money Gaming delivered revenue 
growth in the very competitive UK market, 
despite the headwinds of increased 
regulation and Point of Consumption tax. We 
continued to develop and distribute market 
leading mobile content onto our Grizzly 
platform as well as to third party operators. 
We also streamlined our Social Publishing 
business, reducing losses to break even and 
creating further synergies with our games 
studio in London.
The investment in both our proprietary 
platform and mobile content development 
has led to the continued growth in a younger, 
more casual player set. Mobile play has 
increased to 84.0% (2016: 80.0%) of gross 
gaming revenue. 
Growth in 2017 has been supported by key 
media deals with ITV, including Love Island 
and Dancing On Ice, as well as continuing 
relationships with Fremantle for the X Factor 
and Britain’s Got Talent, which have allowed 
us to offer a more targeted gambling offering 
to our key demographic.

Overview
We have augmented this by the in-house 
creation of 11 new unique ‘Slingo Original’ 
mobile games bringing us to 19 in total, 
which account for over £123m (2016: £86m) 
in wagering on the platform or 27% of the 
gross gaming revenue for the year. 
Gambling player deposits increased to 
£49.8m (2016: £49.0m). We have also 
managed to reduce bonus costs to 26% 
(2016: 29%) of gross gaming revenue. The 
cost per acquisition on the platform was £74 
(2016: £86), and we gained 108,720 (2016: 
116,349) new depositing players in the year. 
Our revenue per depositing player increased 
7% to £162 (2016: £153). 
Demand for our unique content has led to 
the development of a Remote Game Server 
(‘RGS’) which allows our ‘Slingo Original’ 
games to be licensed to third party operators 
as premium content. 2017 saw the launch of 
Slingo Orignals in New Jersey and in Europe. 
This will form a key part of our strategy in 
2018 as we look to expand the reach of our 
content into new international territories. In 
2018 we have achieved growth to 3% of the 
online casino market in New Jersey as well as 
sign deals with several ‘tier one operators’ in 
Europe. We are aiming to be live with 10 ‘tier 
one operators’ by the end of the year. This 
will build high margin, recurring revenue in 
adjacent markets.
We have further integrated the social 
business in H2 2017 with the creation of a 
shared development path which now allows 
us to deliver content simultaneously to both 
real money gaming and social audiences. The 
first offering in this regard is Slingo Arcade 
which, following launch in late Q4/16 has 
become our highest grossing social app with 
very encouraging metrics. In future, emphasis 
will be on using this channel to monetize 
content developed for real money gaming 
similar to licensing our content to third party 
operators. This has resulted in a reduction 
in Social Publishing headcount from 53 in 
June 2016 to 19 in December 2017. With the 
reduction in costs and marketing, we have 
seen revenues fall 13% however this delivered 
a reduced full year EBITDA loss of £0.1m 
(2016: £1.8m). 
Key goals for 2018
 » Continued profitability in Real Money 
Gaming and Social Publishing; following 
2017 cost reductions and operational 
improvements
 » Continue strategic investment in Slingo 
Originals content library for overall revenue 
growth but with greater emphasis on 
content licensing
 » Increase B2B partners on Grizzly platform
 » Increase new licensees for Slingo Original 
content
 » Further expansion of strategic media 
partnerships across all revenue streams

4 June 2018 Market overview
We are continuing to focus on the younger 
more casual gambling demographic. We 
are targeting them through mobile delivery 
and original game IP. This is enabling us to 
acquire and engage players away from the 
more crowded, male orientated sportsbook 
market. The 25 to 34 year-old group are our 
largest segment accounting for over 40% of 
all players. As a result of our content strategy, 
women are delivering higher lifetime values 
on the platform despite the fact that the 
active players, male to female ratio is 50:50.
