Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Chairman’s Statement
 “W e have outperformed 
the market and delivered 
a strong set of results”
John McDonough CBE Chairman
Overview 
2017 was a year of good progress for 
the Group as we saw improvements 
in our trading environment following 
the challenging market conditions 
experienced in 2015 and 2016. We also 
completed a successful transition of 
Chief Executive, with the appointment 
of Patrick André to the role as part of 
a planned succession process. Global 
steel production growth exceeded our 
expectations and pleasingly our overall 
sales growth outperformed the global 
steel market. We also experienced 
positive momentum in the majority of 
foundry end markets. Overall, despite 
experiencing headwinds relating to 
signiﬁ cant raw material price increases 
and some temporary increased 
inter-company sourcing costs, the Group 
saw a 24.2% increase in reported trading 
proﬁ t (16. 1% on an underlying basis), 
and a 20.2% increase in reported 
revenue (12.5% on an underlying basis), 
with cash generation strengthening 
further. The Group continued to make 
good progress with the restructuring 
programme and we remained focused 
on the delivery of our strategy and its 
execution priorities. Finally, in December, 
we strengthened our balance sheet, 
repaying existing borrowing with the 
issuance of debt in the US Private 
Placement market. 
New Chief Executive 
The appointment of our new Chief 
Executive, Patrick André, was a key event 
for Vesuvius this year. It was the result of 
a rigorous process, during which both 
internal and external candidates were 
considered. We are delighted that the 
best ﬁ t for the role came from within 
our own ranks. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank Patrick’s predecessor , 
François Wanecq, for his many years of 
dedicated service to the business and his 
diligence in ensuring a smooth transition. 
We look forward to the years ahead 
under Patrick’s executive leadership. 
Market Dynamics and Strategy
During the year, we saw global steel 
production increase by 5.3% with 
production in the majority of major steel 
countries up year-on-year. In our Foundry 
Division the overall trading environment 
and demand for our products was 
positive across the majority of our key 
end markets.
Throughout the year we faced notable 
inﬂ ationary pressures from signiﬁ cant 
price increases in several key raw 
materials. These initially impacted our 
Advanced Refractories business, but 
subsequently price rises were also 
experienced in the Steel Flow Control 
and Foundry businesses. We responded 
proactively to the pressure placed on 
our business making good progress in 
recovering cost inﬂ ation through higher 
selling prices by year-end.

Review on p18- 19

Governance Section on p74- 121 17
Against this backdrop, we continued to 
focus on the execution of our strategy 
and made good progress on our ﬁ ve 
key execution priorities (see page 10). 
We remain conﬁ dent that these will 
enable us to create value and deliver 
sustainable proﬁ tability for our 
shareholders. We continue to recognise 
the fundamental importance to the 
Group of the capabilities of our people. 
Our highly talented leadership teams and 
operational staff ensure that we are able 
to drive our strategy forward, with quality 
underpinning not only the premium 
promise of our products, services and 
solutions, but also our overall approach 
to business excellence.
Performance and Dividend 
In 2017 , reported sales were £1,683.9m, 
an increase from 2016 of 20.2%. 
Our margins improved to 9.8%, delivering 
reported trading proﬁ t of £165.5m. 
Whilst we experienced some headwinds 
throughout the second half, over the year 
we outperformed our markets in terms of 
growth. These results serve to emphasise 
the strength of our management team 
and their ability to operate effectively 
against the backdrop of a volatile 
market. Vesuvius remains an intrinsically 
cash-generative business and we saw 
strong cash generation throughout 2017 , 
ending the year with a stronger balance 
sheet than in previous years.
The Group continued to make good 
progress in delivering the previously 
announced restructuring programme 
which focused mainly on our Flow 
Control  business. We also commenced 
a completely new programme focusing 
on the Foundry Division in Europe and 
NAFT A, the Advanced Refractories 
business unit in Europe, and Group 
corporate functions.   
Our Headline PBT was £152.9m, 27 .6% 
higher than last year on a reported basis. 
Including amortisation of £19.5m and 
restructuring costs of £36.3m, our PBT 
of £97 . 1m was 22.3% higher than 2016. 
Statutory EPS is 14. 1p.
Our dividend policy aims to deliver 
long-term dividend growth, provided 
this is supported by cash ﬂ ow and 
underlying earnings, and is justiﬁ ed in 
the context of our capital expenditure 
requirements and the prevailing market 
outlook. With this in mind, the Board 
has recommended a ﬁ nal dividend of 
12.5 pence per share for the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: 1 1.4 pence), 
which would result in a total dividend 
for the year of 18.0 pence per share 
(2016: 16.55 pence), an increase of 
8.8%. If approved at the Annual General 
Meeting, this ﬁ nal dividend will be paid 
on 25 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at 13 April 2018.
Board and Governance
In April 2017 , we appointed Holly 
Koeppel as a Non-executive Director, 
replacing Nelda Connors, who resigned 
from the Board in late 2016. Holly has 
more than 35 years’ industry and 
ﬁ nancial experience, and has worked 
with businesses in Australia, China, the 
UK and the US. We are delighted to 
have her signiﬁ cant experience around 
the Board table.
The Board continues to place great 
importance on furthering our 
understanding of the Vesuvius business 
by visiting key operations and engaging 
with as many of our people as possible. 
This year, the full Board visited our 
Foundry operations and customers in 
Brazil, meeting management from all 
business lines and gaining a broader 
understanding of the overall South 
American business. As Chairman, 
I personally visited our operations in 
China in May and, during the year, 
other Non-executive Directors visited 
operations in Skawina in Poland, 
Cleveland and Pittsburgh in the US, 
and Borken in Germany. The Board will 
continue to visit sites across the Group, 
increasing individual knowledge and 
ensuring that we remain connected 
with our operations, management 
teams and people around the world.
The 2017 externally facilitated Board 
evaluation conﬁ rmed that the Board 
continues to function effectively. 
We believe it remains well balanced, 
setting the right tone from the top, with 
a strong mix of relevant experience 
and skills, ensuring that a collaborative 
yet challenging culture is embedded 
throughout the Group.
Our People
In 2016, I noted that to secure the 
current and future performance of 
the Group, the Board had widened its 
focus on succession planning issues, 
additionally reviewing the management 
level immediately below the Board. 
This continues to be a critical area 
for Board attention, with the Board 
fully recognising the importance of 
developing talent and maintaining 
a cadre of diverse and highly capable 
people throughout the business. 
The need for greater diversity 
throughout the business is a goal upon 
which the Board remains focused.
As ever, I continue to be impressed by 
the way in which our leadership teams 
and our people go the ‘extra mile’ to 
exceed our own, and our customers’ 
expectations, as evidenced by our 2017 
results. On behalf of the Board, I thank 
them all.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be 
held on 10 May 2018. The Notice 
of Meeting and explanatory notes 
containing details of the resolutions to 
be put to the meeting accompany this 
Annual Report and Accounts and are 
available on our website (www.vesuvius.
com). I and all my Board colleagues plan 
to attend the Annual General Meeting 
and we look forward to the opportunity 
to meet with as many shareholders as 
possible on the day.
