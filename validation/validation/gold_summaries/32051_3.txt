 INTRODUCTION
I am delighted to update the Group’s stakeholders on 
what has been another very good year for the Joules 
brand.  This is the Group’s first full financial year as a 
public company and we have continued to make great 
progress by further expanding Joules as a premium 
lifestyle brand across product categories, distribution 
channels and geographic markets. 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
JOULES GROUP PLC
The brand’s strong momentum during the year, coupled 
with continued cost control and margin improvement, 
has enabled the Group to record strong growth in profit 
before tax for the Period.  We are very pleased with 
this result, which reflects the growing appeal of the 
Joules brand as well as the careful execution of our clear 
growth strategy.

Chairman’s Statement STRATEGIC PROGRESS
Joules has a distinctive brand and unique product 
proposition.  These qualities, supported by our  
first-class team across the Group, represent our 
strongest competitive advantages in what is a  
fast-changing and challenging retail environment. 
We remain committed to our focused growth strategy 
to deliver the disciplined development and expansion of 
the Joules brand.  At the same time we are challenging 
ourselves to explore new growth opportunities, find 
new ways to delight our customers and operate ever 
more efficiently.  The Chief Executive’s Strategic Report 
provides further details on our growth strategy and the 
progress made during the year. 
The internet and new consumer technologies are 
changing the retail environment in exciting ways and 
creating new opportunities for brands and retailers.  
Joules now has more, and better, methods than 
ever before to engage and connect with its growing 
community of customers.  At the same time, customers’ 
expectations of brands are changing and the requirement 
to provide a seamless and satisfying experience across 
all channels at all times has never been more important.  
As a truly multi-channel brand with an innovative culture 
and very strong customer connection, I am confident 
that Joules will continue to grow, adapt and prosper in 
this dynamic market whilst always remaining true to its 
core values, and providing customers with the quality 
products and experiences we are known and loved for. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS & DIVIDEND
Group revenue of £157.0 million increased by 19.6% 
compared to the prior period (FY16: £131.3m).  
Excluding the impact of currency, Group revenue grew  
by 18.6% in the period.  This reflects strong growth 
in both the Retail and Wholesale segments.  On a 
geographic basis, UK sales increased 17.8% to  
£139.0 million and International sales increased 36.2% to 
£18.0 million, now representing 11.5% of Group revenue.  
Underlying profit before tax increased by 34.0% to  
£10.1 million, and basic underlying EPS was 9.2 pence  
per share (FY16: 6.9 pence).  
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.2 pence per 
share, which if approved at the shareholder’s AGM, will 
take the dividend for the full year to 1.8 pence per share 
(FY16: nil).
The Strategic Report and Financial Review that follow 
provide a more in-depth analysis of the trading 
performance and financial results of the Group. 
OUR TEAM
Central to Joules’ continued success is our fantastic 
team of highly skilled, creative and driven people 
across the business.  I never cease to be proud of the 
shared commitment to the brand and our customers 
which runs through the entire team at Joules, from 
our head office to the stores, distribution centres and 
across international markets.  I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank everyone in the Joules team across 
the world for their continued hard work and dedication 
during this outstanding year for the business. 
THE FUTURE 
We have seen good growth in the first few weeks of  
our new financial year and have received positive early 
feedback on our Spring/Summer 2018 ranges from our 
wholesale customers. 
The short to medium-term headwinds facing UK retailers 
are well documented.  In particular, the final outcome of 
the UK’s decision to leave the European Union remains 
unclear and, as a consequence, the specific macro-
economic effects remain difficult to predict.  However, 
I believe that Joules is well placed to meet these 
uncertainties through a combination of the strength of 
its brand and products; its target customer demographic; 
and the substantial investment that has been made in the 
Group’s infrastructure and supply chain. 
We have a loyal and engaged customer base, a committed 
and enterprising team and a well-invested infrastructure.  
These qualities make us confident of successfully 
delivering the Board’s clear strategy for growing the 
Joules brand in the UK and internationally.
