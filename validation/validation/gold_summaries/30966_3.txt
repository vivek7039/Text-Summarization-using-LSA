I am pleased to report the results for 2017, which reﬂect a proﬁt for the year of £28.6 million (2016: loss
£5.9 million); this includes the previously disclosed exceptional gain on the sale of Duncan Lawrie’s UK
asset management business of £19.2 million, about which more is set out in the Chief Financial Oﬃcer’s
report.
There were no other signiﬁcant changes to the Group structure in the year; however in line with our
strategy and as set out in more detail in the Chief Executive’s report, we made a small acquisition of a
packet tea business in India during the year and since the year end we have acquired a majority
shareholding in Jing Tea. Jing Tea is a UK based distributor of branded speciality teas to the retail and food
service sectors internationally. 
In pursuing our strategic objectives, we have decided to sell two of our smaller engineering businesses,
BMT (Great Yarmouth) and GU Cutting and Grinding, although the sales have yet to complete. More
details are provided in the Chief Executive’s report. 
Trading in 2017 was mixed with a weak start being followed by a much better second half. Our tea
operations performed well as good yields combined with an improving tea price as the year progressed.
However, for the second year running, the macadamia crop was impacted by drought which led to
disappointing volumes. Our speciality crops continue to provide an excellent return which once again
demonstrates the beneﬁts of our diversiﬁed agricultural strategy.
Elsewhere, as previously disclosed, our associate BF&M reported a signiﬁcant reduction in proﬁtability as
a result of the two major hurricanes in September 2017.
Camellia is a business with operations across a number of geographical areas, particularly in emerging
markets, all of which are vulnerable to a global political atmosphere which is relatively unstable by recent
historical standards. Furthermore, changing weather patterns led to a severe drought in the Cape and
Kenya, ﬂooding in Bangladesh and an unprecedented hurricane season in the Caribbean. It is a credit to
our staﬀ across the world that they continue to operate successfully in the face of these challenges.
Board Members
I was delighted to announce the appointment of Gautam Dalal to the Board as a non-executive Director
with eﬀect from 1 March. Gautam’s wide experience of the markets in which we operate will be of great
beneﬁt to the executive team.
Dividend
Your Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 98p per share which, together with the interim dividend
already paid of 37p per share, brings the total distribution for the year to 135p per share compared with
130p per share for 2016.
Outlook
As so much of our result depends on crop volumes in the second half of the year it is not possible to
forecast outturns with any degree of conﬁdence. However, early signs of a better macadamia crop, some
good prices for tea in the ﬁrst quarter of 2018 and continuing strength in our UK markets give us reasons
to be optimistic at this stage.
Staﬀ
As always, my thanks go out to all our staﬀ for their eﬀorts in 2017.
