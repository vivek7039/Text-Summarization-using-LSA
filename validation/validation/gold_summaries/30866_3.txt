    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 11
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
I am pleased to present the Group’s 
Annual Report for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017.
JLT has delivered a strong set of 
financial results in 2017. The Group 
made substantial financial progress, 
returning to strong overall organic 
revenue growth of 5%.
During the year we carried out a 
re-examination of the Group’s strategy, 
and we have made some important 
decisions which we believe will position 
the Group for continued success.
PERFORMANCE
Total revenues increased by 10%, 
or 6% at constant rates of exchange 
(CRE), to £1.39 billion.
The Group’s underlying trading profit 
increased by 10% to £213.7 million 
and by 7% at CRE. Underlying profit 
before tax increased by 11% to 
£191.5 million. The Group's trading 
margin was maintained at 15.4%.
Our reported profit before tax  
increased by 35% to £181.6 million, 
which includes the impact of net 
exceptional items of £9.9 million.
Reported diluted EPS increased to 
54.7p and underlying diluted EPS 
increased to 58.5p.
INCREASED DIVIDEND
The Directors have recommended 
a final dividend of 21.8 pence per share 
(2016: 20.6 pence) for the year to  
31 December 2017. The dividend will be 
paid on 8 May 2018 to shareholders who 
are on the register as at 3 April 2018.
This will bring the total dividend for  
the year to 34.0 pence per share,  
an overall increase of 5.6% and the  
ninth consecutive year that JLT has  
paid an increased dividend.
The business has delivered a Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) of 328% 
over the past nine years, as illustrated 
in the chart on page 87.
CORPORATE ACTIVITY 
HIGHLIGHTS
Our Risk & Insurance businesses 
delivered organic revenue growth of 
5% in the year, with strong client retention 
and new business in JLT Europe delivering 
good performances from most divisions in 
challenging market conditions. 
The build-out of our US Specialty 
platform continues, with revenues 
approaching USD 100 million in 2017.  
The net investment losses peaked in 
2016 and reduced in 2017 and we 
remain fully focused on achieving 
profits as planned in 2019. 
JLT Re achieved organic revenue growth 
of 4%, with a trading margin of 20% 
which reflected its continued investment 
in the business. 
The UK and Ireland Employment Benefits 
businesses saw a return to growth in 
2017. Trading profits increased by 40% 
from 2016 with organic revenue growth 
of 8%. 
In the year, the Group completed three 
acquisitions, for a total consideration of 
£61.2 million, as it continued to build 
further scale in its existing businesses 
and geographies.
The Group is making investments to 
strengthen its representation in continental 
Europe. These investments support  
the Group's preparations for different 
Brexit scenarios. 
In light of the investments being made 
and the preparatory work that has been 
undertaken, we do not anticipate that 
Brexit will materially impact our ability to 
serve clients and access markets in the 
European Union.

RE-EXAMINATION OF GROUP STRATEGY
During 2017 we carried out a re-examination of the Group’s 
strategy, in order to ensure that it remains appropriate to 
support and enable our future growth plans so we can continue 
to create long-term value for our stakeholders. The review 
resulted in a number of key conclusions in respect of the future 
shape of the Group’s strategy, recognising the importance of 
JLT’s distinctive identity and culture and deep specialist strength 
as key differentiators between JLT and its larger competitors; 
and the importance of consistent and coordinated collaboration 
across divisions, regions and industry practices.
The review also recognised JLT’s international development 
needs and opportunities, including in the US, where our 
representation now creates the opportunity for us to move from 
an international to a global business. As a result of the review, 
the Group reformulated its mission during the year: ‘To become 
the leading global specialist risk adviser and broker’.
To progress towards our mission, the Group is undertaking a 
number of strategic initiatives, including: 
• the simplification of our business and management 
structure. As we announced in January, from 1 April 2018, 
our regional insurance broking operations will be brought 
together into an integrated Specialty division. The Group’s 
businesses will then be structured into three divisions, 
Reinsurance, Specialty and Employee Benefits; 
• the implementation of a Global Transformation Programme 
to streamline the operational processes we use to serve 
clients in each of our divisions, to deliver global consistency 
and eliminate duplicated costs;
• building on the firm foundation we have already established 
in the US through continuing organic revenue growth, 
complemented by targeted acquisitions; and
• coordinating the marketing and operation of our Employee 
Benefits activities worldwide.  
Further details regarding the strategy review and these key 
initiatives can be found in the Chief Executive’s Review on 
pages 14 to 17 and in the Reviewing & Delivering Our Strategy 
section on pages 22 to 24.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board continues to recognise the need for a strong 
corporate governance framework and supporting processes 
across the Group and believes that good governance, with 
tone set from the top, is a key factor in delivering sustainable 
business performance and creating value for the Group's 
stakeholders. The Board feels that it has a good balance of 
experience, skills and knowledge to support and challenge 
the management team, and that it is supported by effective 
governance and control systems. More information on these 
systems can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 57 to 66. In addition, the Directors’ Report on pages 91 
to 98 reports on JLT’s compliance with the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) during 2017.
During the year, the Board and its Committees undertook 
reviews of their effectiveness. The conclusions from these 
reviews provided useful feedback to each body on its 
performance. Further details are provided in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 57 to 66. 
JLT’s share incentive schemes are designed to ensure that 
decisions are made by management to support long-term 
growth, that the right behaviours are rewarded and that 
management’s interests are aligned with those of shareholders. 
Further details of the operation of these schemes can be found 
in the Directors' Remuneration Report set out on pages 78 to 90.
The strength and support of Jardine Matheson has been, and 
will continue to be, an important factor in the success of JLT. 
Since 2014 a Relationship Agreement has been in place with 
Jardine Matheson, in accordance with the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which require shareholders 
with a 30% or more shareholding to comply with certain 
independence provisions set out in a written and legally 
binding agreement. More detail on the relationship with 
Jardine Matheson is set out on page 66.
BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT

following his appointment as the Chairman of Lloyd’s of London, 
and Jonathan Dawson retired on 3 October 2017. I should like 
to record the Board’s thanks to Bruce and Jonathan for their

its Committees.
We were pleased to welcome Andrew Didham and

As we announced on 28 February 2018, Lynne Peacock will

OUR PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank everyone in JLT for 
their continued hard work and contribution to the Group’ s results 
in 2017. I would also like to welcome all our new colleagues who 
have joined JLT during the year. Whatever part of the Group I visit 
I always see evidence of the distinctive culture at JLT that values 
agility and entrepreneurial drive, rigour and depth of thought and 
a collaborative approach that puts customers first. There is further 
information about our colleagues and culture on page 7.
OUR ROLE IN SOCIETY
JLT takes its role in society seriously and has an active 
Corporate Responsibility programme. JLT’s approach is 
coordinated by a Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee, 
which has Board, Group Executive Committee and senior 
management membership.
JLT supports the charitable efforts of colleagues around 
the Group. We currently focus on three strategic partners 
aligned to our own areas of business, sharing the social 
benefits of knowledge, wellbeing and resilience. Our current 
partners on these strategic themes are Udaan Foundation 
(knowledge), Alzheimer's Society (wellbeing) and RedR 
(resilience). We manage the majority of our charitable giving 
business-by-business, with a central fund to provide greater 
support to our strategic partners.
We regularly engage clients in joint fundraising activities and 
see this as an important part of client relationship building.
We match pound-for-pound money raised by UK staff in 
fundraising activities and all UK staff are entitled to take one 
Charity Day per year, when they can spend company time helping 
a charity. The Group Charities Committee considers the many 
requests we receive from charities and takes a particular interest 
in those charities connected to communities local to our offices.
Our Diversity Committee has defined our diversity agenda on the 
basis of three pillars: Networking, Sponsorship and Involvement, 
while ensuring that all of our activities are inclusive, whether 
externally or internally focused. In 2017, JLT supported a number 
of initiatives, both internally and at public events in the London 
and other markets, to help drive a more diverse and inclusive 
business and to play our part in addressing diversity challenges 
in our industry. 
We are also keen to ensure that we minimise our environmental 
impact and we take a number of steps to reduce our carbon 
footprint, such as encouraging the use of teleconferencing facilities 
where possible, instead of travelling to face-to-face meetings.
Further details can be found in our Corporate Responsibility 
Report on pages 46 to 55.
SHARE BUY-BACK AUTHORITY
We will be seeking renewal of our standing share buy-back 
authority at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, up to a 
maximum of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. 
As in previous years, we will not be seeking shareholder 
approval for a dispensation under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code 
in relation to this authority. This means that if the Directors 
were to initiate a buy-back, then in order to avoid triggering 
a mandatory offer obligation on Jardine Matheson Holdings 
(JMH) under Rule 37 of the Takeover Code, JMH would need 
to be able to participate in those buy-backs so that its overall 
percentage holding (which as at 22 February 2018 was 40.16%) 
did not increase following the buy-back.
Although the Company has not utilised the authority to buy 
back shares since 2008, the Board believes it would be in the 
interests of all shareholders for the Company to have the right 
to purchase its own shares in the market in the appropriate 
circumstances. We would only exercise this authority if we 
believe it is in the best interests of the shareholders and would 
result in an improvement in earnings per share.
OUTLOOK 
Overall the Group is in very good shape and well placed to take 
advantage of the current market environment. We enter 2018 
looking forward to continuing strong organic revenue growth 
and further financial progress.
