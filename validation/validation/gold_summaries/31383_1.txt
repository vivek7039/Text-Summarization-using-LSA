 Applying the best 
technology to appraise 
and develop our 
unconventional assets 
can unlock significant 
value and upside
Anuj Sharma 
Chief executive officer
Creation of Phoenix
The completion of the combination of 
Andes Energia and Trefoil in the year has 
created a pure play Argentina-focused 
independent exploration and production 
company with real scale and the ability to 
finance an active unconventional work 
programme in the Vaca Muerta. 
Production, reserves and resources
At 31 December 2017, Phoenix had 
production of more than 11,000 boepd, 
representing approximately 1% of 
Argentina’s total oil and gas production. 
Our 2P reserves have been independently 
assessed at 57.2 million boe, and our 
contingent and prospective resources 
have been independently assessed at 
1,795 million boe.
We have working interest acreage in the 
Vaca Muerta of approximately 560,000 
acres – equivalent to approximately 7.5% 
of the formation acreage as a whole. 
We firmly believe that Vaca Muerta, 
and other unconventional resources in 
Argentina, represent the next shale oil 
revolution, and that Phoenix is well 
positioned to create significant value and 
play a meaningful part in the growth 
of the Argentine unconventional oil and 
gas industry.
Securing operatorship and acreage
Since August 2017, we have built 
on our strategy to consolidate our 
acreage position and have sought to 
increase the number of Phoenix operated 
positions across our portfolio. 
In the Rio Atuel licence, adjacent to 
our Puesto Rojas area, we successfully 
negotiated and doubled our participation 
taking it to 66.7% and secured the 
operatorship from Tecpetrol in 
October 2017. 
In April 2018, we successfully renegotiated 
the memorandum of understanding that 
was previously in place in respect of the 
Mata Mora and Corralera blocks. The 
renegotiation resulted in the formation 
of a joint venture with GyP, the Neuquén 
province-owned oil and gas company. 
Phoenix has increased its participation in 
the Mata Mora and the majority of the 
Corralera areas from 27% to 90%. In doing 
so, we have also assumed operatorship. 
Additionally, in the recent Neuquén province 
bid-round, we acquired four new blocks 
with development potential in the 
unconventional Vaca Muerta, 
Mulichnico and Agrio formations.

Integration, technology transfer 
and people
In October 2017, we consolidated our 
teams in Buenos Aires and moved into 
our new offices at Torre Alem Plaza. This 
brought our corporate team together in 
a single location and fast-tracked the 
integration process. Moving to a single 
location and integrating staff has enabled 
us to instil our corporate culture, and the 
values that underpin our governance 
objectives, across all of our teams. 
Phoenix opened its technical excellence 
centre in Houston in April 2018. Transferring 
the knowledge and technology developed in 
the US shale industry to Argentina and 
bringing that knowledge to bear in the 
development of our assets is fundamental 
to the Phoenix strategy. We have already 
made a number of key expert appointments 
including a senior geophysicist, senior 
geoscientist and have secured the services 
of a senior directional drilling engineer. 
Basing our technical centre in Houston puts 
our team directly in the engine room of the 
US shale industry and provides us access to 
the best and most experienced service 
providers and consultants in the US. 
We have strengthened our team in 
Mendoza with the appointment of a new 
asset manager with responsibility for our 
Argentina asset portfolio and have also 
recruited a specialist in directional drilling 
who will oversee the execution of our 
upcoming horizontal drilling activities. 
Our teams in Mendoza and Houston are 
technologically enabled to work closely 
with each other to marry in-country 
operational excellence and a deep 
understanding of our assets with world 
class geological, geophysical and technical 
expertise. This unconventional technical 
expertise, developed over years of working 
unconventional plays in the US, will enable 
us to optimise our appraisal and 
evaluation programme of the company’s 
significant unconventional opportunities. 1 As per WD Von Gonten & Company, NSAI, OPC and Francisco Guilsano reports

11 Unconventional regulations in Mendoza
The recently announced unconventional 
oil and gas regulations in Mendoza 
province are very important for our 
industry. They provide us with the 
framework to move forward responsibly 
with our appraisal and evaluation 
activities in the northern part of the 
Neuquina basin, where we have 
approximately 745,000 working interest 
acres of which approximately 445,000 
are prospective for unconventional 
development. These regulations are the 
result of several months’ work by the 
province and its advisers and, in our 
view, reflect industry best practice. 
The regulations balance the protection 
of the environment and the communities 
we operate in with the responsible 
development of the province’s significant 
unconventional oil and gas resources. 
Importantly, the regulations provide the 
foundation for our continued and 
increased investment in the province of 
Mendoza that will bring job creation both 
in our own operations and in the service 
industry that supports us. This 
investment will also bring direct benefit 
to the province through taxes and 
royalties. Because the combination 
brought together two existing groups 
already active in Mendoza province, we 
believe that we benefit from an early 
entrant advantage in the province on 
which we are well positioned to capitalise 
as we appraise and evaluate the Vaca 
Muerta and Tight Agrio formations.
Business development
As well as investing in our existing asset 
base, Phoenix continues to evaluate 
non-organic growth opportunities, 
including participating in new licence 
bid rounds and other third-party 
sale processes. 
In April 2018, the company successfully 
participated in the Neuquén province bid 
round, securing four additional operated 
blocks that are prospective for 
unconventional appraisal. 
In addition, the company participated 
in the bidding round in the Mendoza 
province, bidding for blocks which are 
proximate to our existing interests in 
the province. 
Outlook
The 2018 accelerated business plan more 
than doubles our 2017 capital expenditure 
programme. Phoenix plans to target 
capital expenditure on key assets in and 
around the Puesto Rojas area and on our 
Mata Mora licence. 
us$190m
capital expenditure for 
2018 accelerated business plan
70%
focused on unconventional

The capital expenditure programme also 
involves a new 3D seismic survey being 
shot on the southern part of the Puesto 
Rojas, and the La Brea and Rio Atuel 
licences, together with drilling nine 
additional vertical wells to appraise the 
Vaca Muerta and Tight Agrio formations. 
Later in the year, we plan to drill our first 
horizontal wells in the Puesto Rojas area 
which, if successful, will be an important 
milestone in demonstrating the potential 
for large-scale unconventional 
development in the Puesto Rojas area. 
In the second half of 2018, we plan to drill 
and complete our first two unconventional 
horizontal wells on the Mata Mora licence 
area. Again, the results of our pilot well 
and initial horizontal wells will inform 
our plan for a full-scale development 
programme of Vaca Muerta at Mata Mora.
Mata Mora is a core concession for the 
group as it represents a significant 
operated acreage position in Vaca 
Muerta and lies on-trend with a number 
of existing unconventional production 
areas. These existing production areas 
account for almost all of the current 
commercial oil production from the Vaca 
Muerta formation. 
Phoenix Global Resources plc
STRATEGIC REPORT
12 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT CONTINUED Phoenix will also continue to invest in its 
conventional reserves in the Neuquina 
basin, that provide the company with low 
risk and high netback production. At the 
Puesto Rojas area, the company has net 
2P conventional reserves of 17.2 MMboe. 
Similarly, we have net 2P conventional 
reserves of 6.0 MMboe at Chachahuen, 
where we continue to invest with our 
operating partner, YPF. 
In addition, our assets in the Austral and 
Cuyana basins will continue to provide 
Phoenix with steady, profitable gas and 
oil production, respectively.
We are committed to the judicious 
deployment of our capital to the projects 
that will create the greatest value for our 
shareholders. In the medium term this will 
involve balancing short-term production 
growth with the longer term objective of 
migrating our significant unconventional 
resources to reserves and on into 
profitable production.
I believe that Phoenix has many attractive 
investment opportunities across our asset 
base in Argentina and I look forward to the 
challenge of developing our unconventional 
exploration opportunities into world-class 
production assets. 
Anuj Sharma 
Chief executive officer 
4 June 2018
Our overriding objective is to build value over 
the medium to long term, focusing our efforts 
on the following priority areas:
 > Proving up and de-risking our extensive unconventional acreage. Phoenix is 
one of the largest holders of acreage with unconventional potential in 
Argentina. The company’s initial focus is on appraising, de-risking and 
developing this large unconventional asset base. We plan to progressively 
move our assets into development phase as we appraise and de-risk, working 
across our substantial asset portfolio.
 > Building our organisation to prepare for large scale development of our 
unconventional resources. Phoenix will continue to strengthen our organisation 
adding expertise through specific appointments and developing our people 
through training programmes, as we prepare for the large scale development 
of our unconventional resources. Bringing the right expertise from the US 
independents’ shale experience remains key to the efficient development of 
Argentina’s vast unconventional resources. Phoenix will continue to leverage 
that experience through our Houston technical centre.
 > Opportunistic inorganic growth through farm-ins, joint ventures, partnerships 
and portfolio rationalisation. While Phoenix holds a large portfolio of both 
unconventional and conventional assets and is well set for long term organic 
growth, the group remains open to working with others to develop our own 
portfolio or to add new prospects to our portfolio. This may be through 
acquisition, farm-in/out opportunities, joint ventures or partnerships in the 
Neuquina basin and other attractive basins throughout Argentina. We will 
focus on opportunities where we can realise attractive synergies, share 
know-how, or where such arrangements have clear strategic and operational 
alignment with other operators.

Future priorities  Ov erview of the Argentina 
oil and gas market
Brent crude opened the year at US$55.05 
per barrel and struggled to make upward 
progress through the first half before 
hitting a low in June of US$44.09 
per barrel. 
In the second half of 2017, both the Brent 
and WTI benchmark indices strengthened 
as the impact of the predicted rebalancing 
of global oil inventories began to provide 
more robust support for prices. Brent 
closed the year at US$66.73 per barrel. 
This reflected lower levels of investment 
over the last several years coupled with 
stronger quota compliance among OPEC 
member countries continuing to suppress 
inventories. Prices have remained firm 
into 2018 with the US$70.00 per barrel 
Brent crude threshold breached on 8 May 
2018 for the first time since December 
2014. Prices have increased further 
through May and breached the 
US$80.00 per barrel threshold.
Whilst industry-wide investment in 
exploration and development activity 
remains at relatively low levels, a number of 
prospective investment bright spots have 
emerged, notably including Argentina 
where the Vaca Muerta and other relatively 
virgin unconventional formations have 
continued to attract significant levels of 
interest and investment.
The current administration continues to 
welcome inward investment as regulatory 
and fiscal reform continues apace. The oil 
and gas industry can play a significant 
role in the economic rehabilitation of 
Argentina through its potential to make a 
rapid and meaningful impact on the 
balance of trade. Increased domestic oil 
and gas production will reduce the 
reliance on expensive oil and gas imports 
and will lead to job creation in Argentina, 
driving further economic prosperity. 
Commodity price volatility 
continued to be a feature 
of our market in 2017. 
ARGENTINA’S ENERGY MIX
Argentina has a relatively high level 
of dependence on hydrocarbons for 
its energy with approximately 89% 
of the country’s energy needs satisfied 
by oil and gas. Coal consumption is 
low reflecting the low level of coal 
deposits in Argentina compared 
to other nations, resulting in 
comparatively low CO
2
 emissions.

OIL PRODUCTION
Domestic oil production has declined by 
approximately 13% in the period from 2012 
to 2017. The rate of decline has accelerated 
in recent years as an increasing number 
of mature conventional oil fields are 
affected by natural decline. Average 
daily production fell from approximately 
512,000 bpd in 2016 to approximately 
479,000 bpd in 2017, a decrease of 
approximately 6.4% year on year.
GAS CONSUMPTION
The majority of gas consumption is in 
three sectors, namely power generation, 
industrial manufacturing and gas for 
domestic heating and cooking. 
GAS PRODUCTION
Gas production has been relatively 
consistent in the period from 2012 to 
2017 with decline from conventional gas 
assets in the period to 2014 replaced by 
initial gas production volumes from 
Vaca Muerta and other unconventional 
and tight gas formations from 2015 
through 2017. 
WHO PRODUCES OIL AND PHOENIX’S POSITION
Oil production in Argentina is dominated 
by YPF, the state-owned production 
company, and Pan American Energy, 
the joint venture between BP and 
Bridas. Phoenix currently accounts for 
approximately 1.6% of total oil production 
in Argentina. The substantial majority of 
this production is from relatively mature 
conventional assets. 
The company’s position as an early 
entrant in the unconventional sector 
bolstered by the steady acquisition 
and consolidation of acreage, provides 
the springboard for Phoenix to play 
a significant role in the development 
of the industry and of unconventional 
production in Argentina.
OIL IMPORTS
In 2017, Argentina imported 
approximately a net 17,500 bpd 
accounting for approximately 3.5% 
of total consumption.
GAS IMPORTS
Approximately 23% of Argentina’s annual 
gas needs are currently sourced through 
import, either through pipeline from 
Bolivia or internationally in the form 
of LNG.

15 THE ISSUE
OUR RESPONSE
LINK TO STRATEGY
Argentina previously operated a semi-
regulated pricing regime that was removed 
in October 2017. Sales contracts are 
typically priced by reference to Brent with 
a location/quality discount applied. Whilst 
the removal of the semi-regulated pricing 
removes downside price protection it 
does allow companies to participate 
in upside gains.
Oil and gas prices have been volatile in 
the last several years including periods 
of consistently low prices driven by 
over-supply. Exposure to oil price risk 
can significantly affect the amount of 
cash generated from operations from 
one period to the next. 
Oil prices have been strengthening 
recently and the company has 
implemented a hedging policy to fix 
prices when it is commercially 
appropriate to do so. In fixing prices 
through swap contracts the company 
is able to have clarity on funds from 
operations to underpin budgeted 
capital expenditure. This is particularly 
important in periods of significant 
development activity.
The company only enters hedging 
arrangements in respect of a portion of 
the production derived from our proved, 
developed, producing (pdp) wells. In 
addition, we do not hedge anticipated 
increases in production upfront.
Argentina has a natural gas deficit and 
relies on imports of gas from Bolivia and 
also LNG cargoes from the international 
market. Argentina has little to no coal 
reserves and relies heavily on gas for power 
generation. The import price for gas is 
high with imports from Bolivia averaging 
US$4.8 per MMbtu in 2017 and LNG 
priced on average at US$5.7 per MMbtu. 
The 2017 domestic gas price averaged 
only US$3.6 per MMbtu. This results in an 
import loss of US$1.2 – US$2.1 per MMbtu 
that directly affects the country’s balance 
of trade. In order to encourage domestic 
production and reduce the reliance on 
imported gas, a number of incentive 
schemes are in place whereby a producer 
can receive a higher price for gas in 
certain circumstances. Argentine shale 
gas currently attracts a premium of 
approximately US$3.6 per MMbtu over 
the prevailing domestic price.
Phoenix is a price taker for gas and 
does not seek to hedge production. 
The majority of Phoenix’s current gas 
production is derived from conventional 
assets in the Santa Cruz Sur area.
The company’s objective for gas 
production in the long term is to develop 
the unconventional gas resources that 
we have within our portfolio where 
commercially viable. We will continue 
to work with our partner, ROCH S.A. 
to maximise Santa Cruz production. 
The company will participate in gas 
incentive arrangements where possible.

STRATEGIC REPORT
16 OUR MARKET DRIVERS CONTINUED The Argentine Peso has historically been 
weak and has suffered extended periods 
of devaluation. Concurrently cost inflation 
in Argentina has been high with the 
Consumer Price Index showing inflation 
of 24.8%, 38.0% and 25.0% in 2015, 2016 
and 2017 respectively. Bringing inflation 
under control together with stabilising and 
strengthening the Peso is a key tenet of 
the current administration’s policy agenda 
that has a goal of bringing price inflation 
down to the 5% level by 2020/2021.
The oil and gas industry in Argentina 
benefits from a degree of natural hedge 
protection from currency risk as sales 
contracts for oil are denominated in 
US Dollars by reference to the Brent 
benchmark price. In addition, oilfield 
service contracts, for example those 
related to drilling and completion, are 
also mostly denominated and settled 
in US Dollars.
Cost inflation affects the company in 
relation to salaries and wages that are 
denominated in Peso and are adjusted for 
inflation periodically before performance 
or other increases. In addition, contracts 
for parts, materials, services or property 
sourced domestically will increase year on 
year due to inflation.
The unconventional oil and gas industry 
in Argentina has seen a significant 
uptick in investment and activity in the 
last several years. There are a limited 
number of drilling rigs in the country 
that are capable of drilling the long 
lateral horizontal wells that are required 
for evaluation and, ultimately, large-
scale production. In addition, the number 
of unconventional completion crews with 
international experience is limited and 
their availability is driven by demand.
The company seeks to form relationships 
with trusted service providers and 
individual crews. Contracts for drilling 
and completion services are put in 
place in advance and campaigns are 
scheduled to maximise operational 
efficiencies and crew and equipment 
mobilisation and demobilisation 
synergies where possible.
Argentina is a net 
importer of both oil and 
gas. The unconventional 
industry has the 
potential to make 
Argentina self sufficient 
in terms of its energy 
needs and to help 
redress the country’s 
balance of payments.
