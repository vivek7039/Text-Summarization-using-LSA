Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
A STRONG YEAR
2017 was a good year for Jupiter 
across all our activities: three-year 
investment performance, net inflows 
and delivery on a number of strategic 
projects. This was delivered within a 
supportive market environment.
The key measure of our investment 
performance is the percentage of mutual 
fund AUM with above‑ median performance, 
after all fees, over three years. This 
increased from 75% in 2016 to 81% in 2017, 
as our clients continued to benefit from our 
culture of high performance, independent 
thinking and accountability. 
I was very pleased with the net inflows 
of £5.5bn (2016: £1.0bn), which help to 
show the success of our diversification 
strategy, with positive inflows across 
each quarter. These inflows, coupled 
with our investment outperformance 
and market movements, resulted in a 
24% increase in our AUM. This, in turn, 
underpinned our financial performance.
Net revenues totalled £409.5m, up 17% 
(2016: £351.4m), including a 19% increase 
in net management fees to £392.4m 
(2016: £330.2m). The adjusted cost 
income ratio was steady at 55%, which 
meant that the revenue growth funded 
continued investment in our business and 
platform as well as increased profitability. 
Statutory profit before tax rose by 13% 
to £192.9m; underlying profit before tax 
increased from £168.4m in 2016 to 
£193.8m in 2017, representing growth of 
15%. Underlying earnings per share were 
16% higher at 34.2p (2016: 29.4p). The 
Group converts a high proportion of 
earnings into cash, generating operating 
cash flows after tax of £194.6m in 2017 
(2016: £147.3m). This supports our ability 
to maintain a strong balance sheet 
position while paying significant 
dividends to shareholders.
Our strategic progress was recognised 
in 2017 when Investment Week named 
Jupiter ‘Global Group of the Year’, based 
on our ‘strong investment performance 
across the board and a developing pool 
of rising talent, combined with a 
willingness to tackle industry issues 
ahead of others’. This award reflects our 
transformation over the past five years 
and our adaptability in changing 
regulatory environments.
A successful diversification strategy
All regions contributed to our net 
inflows in 2017, with the offices in Italy 
and Spain exceeding our expectations 
for the year. In total, the international 
distribution platform we have built 
provided 75% of our net inflows in 2017, 
without requiring significant additional 
resources in country to deliver that 
growth. The UK also grew in 2017, as 
inflows to investment strategies launched 
in recent years more than offset outflows 
from our longstanding fund of funds 
strategy.
Fixed income has been a major 
contributor to our AUM growth for 
several years and it was the largest 
source of net inflows in 2017. Fixed 
income AUM now stands at £13.4bn 
or 27% of the total for the Group, 
contributing towards our strategic goal 
of diversifying across different product 
types. There was also meaningful 
demand for a range of other strategies, 
including absolute return and global 
emerging markets. Growth in our 
Absolute Return, India and Distribution 
unit trusts means that 13 of our funds 
now have assets of more than £1bn, 
together accounting for £36.5bn of 
our AUM.
We continue to develop attractive 
new products. In 2017, we launched 
two emerging market debt funds and 
the Emerging & Frontier Income Trust. 
These launches underline Jupiter’s 
growing expertise and reputation in 
emerging markets, which accounts for 
an increasing proportion of our AUM. 
We also see alternatives as an exciting 
area of growth for Jupiter and we 
launched the Global Levered Absolute 
Return Fund to build on the success of 
the Absolute Return Fund. Looking 
further ahead, we see real opportunities 
to serve more institutional clients who 
seek active outperformance; we will 
continue to develop our institutional 
capabilities during 2018 and beyond.
Investing for growth
Towards the end of the year, we 
completed the implementation of a 
significant upgrade to our fund 
management, investment operations and 
risk platform. This will help us to support 
an increasingly diverse set of investment 
strategies and underpins our ability to 
grow. It was also an essential component 
of our programme of work to be well 
prepared for MiFID II compliance from 
January 2018. These important and 
complicated projects were finished on 
time. Continued investment to support 
the business is a vital element of our 
growth strategy and we will continue 
to invest in enhancing our systems and 
processes to prepare effectively for new 
regulations over the coming years.
Outlook
I am pleased that Jupiter’s operating 
model continues to demonstrate 
resilience and agility against a 
continually challenging and evolving 
backdrop. The strong growth we have 
experienced is because we put the 
client at the heart of everything we do. 
Our creative responses to delivering 
what they want has driven our success. 
The increase in our AUM in 2017 
should translate into a good start for 
the business in 2018. However, the 
previously announced changes to our 
unit trust pricing and our decision to 
bear all the costs of research will result 
in a profit headwind of around £18m from 
2018. Our investment performance 
statistics are at a high, in part due to the 
very strong performance of three years 
ago. Maintaining this level is a key 
challenge in 2018. We will also continue 
to invest in the business, embedding and 
optimising our new platform and starting 
a programme to upgrade systems 
supporting the sales and distribution 
teams.
The resilience of our current operating 
model and balance sheet strength mean 
that, despite the continued disruptions 
and uncertainties that exist around us, 
we are well placed to continue our 
growth trajectory and look for new 
areas of opportunity.
