Our businesses
Our improved financial results have been 
driven by a strong and disciplined operational 
performance in both our housebuilding and 
commercial developments businesses. 
Housebuilding
Housebuilding results
The business performed well throughout 
the financial year and delivered against 
both its financial and operational targets. 
Market conditions remain supportive, 
with attractive mortgage financing and 
the support of Help to Buy driving strong 
consumer demand.
We are the UK’s largest housebuilder with 
total completions at 17,395 units including JV’s 
(2016: 17,319). Private completions increased 
by 0.8% to 13,303 (2016: 13,198), affordable 
completions were 3,342 (2016: 2,707), and 
JV completions in which the Group had an 
interest were 750 (2016: 1,414). 
We continue to increase the proportion 
of higher margin land completions which 
accounted for 92% (2016: 86%) of the total 
in the year and to trade through our legacy 
assets which has also contributed to the 
improvement in our gross margin. 
Total average selling price (‘ASP’) on 
completions in the year increased by 
6.0% to £275.2k (2016: £259.7k), with 
private ASP increasing by 8.0% to £313.1k 
(2016: £289.8k) benefiting from mix changes 
and underlying house price inflation. 
Completions in our London business were 
in line with expectations and weighted to the 
second half, consistent with planned site build 
programmes, resulting in a higher ASP in the 
second half of FY17. 
We lead the industry in the high 
quality of our homes and our 
customer service.

Chief Executive
Our results 
We have traded strongly throughout the financial year, delivering a record profit before 
tax of £765.1m, up 12.1% on the prior year (2016: £682.3m). We achieved our targets set 
in September 2014 of a 20% gross margin and 25% ROCE, with 2017 gross margin at 
20.0% (2016: 18.9%) and our highest ROCE in 12 years at 29.8% (2016: 27.1%). 
We have also continued to strengthen our Balance Sheet, ending the year with 
net cash of £723.7m (2016: £592.0m) and with net tangible assets of £3,430.0m 
(2016: £3,118.0m).

Our FY17 sales rate was 0.72 (2016: 0.69) net 
private reservations per active outlet per 
week in the full year and 0.76 (2016: 0.72) in the 
second half. During the year, we operated from 
an average of 377 active outlets including JV’s 
(2016: 378). 
Our share of profits from JV’s and associates 
in the year for the housebuilding business 
decreased to £26.5m (2016: £72.4m), reflecting 
planned site build programmes and some 
headwinds in the central London market. 
As at 30 June 2017 we were selling from 11 
(2016: 11) JV outlets. In FY18 we expect to deliver 
around 750 joint venture completions and our 
share of profits from JV’s to be around £25m.
Committed to building more high 
quality homes
We are dedicated to playing our part in 
addressing the UK’s housing shortage, 
whilst maintaining our quality standards, and 
designing developments, which look great, are 
a pleasure to live on, and will enhance local 
communities for years to come.
We lead the industry in the high quality of our 
homes and our customer service. That quality 
is recognised through the NHBC Pride in the 
Job Awards for site management where we 
have achieved more awards than any other 
housebuilder for the 13th consecutive year. 
We are also the only major housebuilder to 
be rated five star by our customers in the 
HBF customer satisfaction survey for eight 
consecutive years. 
We are committed to investing in the future of 
housebuilding. We continue to offer a range of 
graduate, apprentice and trainee programmes 
and are one of the largest employers of 
apprentices in the industry. In addition, we 
have successfully trialled a programme to 
recruit and train ex-forces personnel in site 
management. We also continue to develop, 
trial and implement modern methods 
of construction which can help address 
industry-wide skills challenges and support 
future growth. 
The key dimensions underpinning delivery 
of our strategy
In addition to the generally favourable market 
conditions during the year, the increase in our 
housebuilding profitability has benefited from 
our successful land investment strategy and 
from improvements in operating margin. 
Land and planning
A key factor in the growth of our housebuilding 
business in recent years has been our land 
investment strategy, which has boosted 
absolute profit and led to increased completion 
volumes. The land market remained attractive 
throughout the financial year and we secured 
excellent opportunities that exceeded our 
minimum hurdle rates of 20% gross margin 
and 25% site ROCE. In the period, we approved 
the purchase of £957.2m (2016: £1,095.6m) of 
land, equating 18,497 plots (2016: 24,387 plots). 
We expect to approve the purchase of over 
20,000 plots in FY18. 
We continue to target a regionally balanced 
land portfolio with a supply of owned land 
of c. 3.5 years and a further c. 1.0 year of 
controlled land. Our target for a shorter than 
sector average land bank reflects our focus 
on ROCE and our fast build and sell model. 
At 30 June 2017 we achieved this target with 
a 4.5 years land supply comprising 3.5 years 
owned land and 1.0 years controlled land, 
with the owned land bank including land with 
both outline and detailed planning consents. 
At 30 June 2017, the ASP of plots in our owned 
land bank was £265k.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
On strategic land we are making good 
progress and in FY17 we have achieved 
our mid-term target of delivering 25% of 
completions from strategic land. We target 
continued growth in the participation of 
strategically sourced land in the medium term, 
which will support future margin growth. 
Following our success with planning over the 
past 12 months we are very well positioned, 
with all of our expected FY18 completions 
(2016: 99.7% of FY17 completions) having 
outline or full planning consent.
Improving efficiency and reducing costs
Improving the efficiency of our operations and 
controlling costs continues to be a high priority 
for the Group, as it will further enhance 
our margin. 
In 2016, the Group undertook a fundamental 
review of its Barratt and David Wilson housing 
ranges. The outcome was a reduction in 
the number of houses in the range which 
will increase standardisation, simplify 
construction and reduce build costs whilst 
maintaining our high standards of design and 
build quality. There are currently 132 sites 
with c. 19,000 plots where we will be using 
the new ranges, of which 51 sites are already 
under construction. 
We have also focused on improving margins 
through further standardisation of our layouts, 
stopping the advance sale of show homes and 
through business process simplification. 
We have a robust and carefully managed 
supply chain with 90% of the housebuild 
materials sourced by our centralised 
procurement function manufactured or 
assembled in the UK. The cost of c. 75% of our 
centrally procured materials is now fixed until 
the end of FY18. 
On labour, whilst we continue to see some 
pressure on skilled labour supply with 
shortages remaining location and trade 
specific, the rate of cost increase has eased. 
We are also seeking to increase construction 
efficiency and reduce demand on labour 
through implementing the new housetype 
ranges which are easier to build and through 
the use of alternative build options such as 
timber frames, large format block and light 
gauge steel frames.
We continue to expect that overall build cost 
inflation for FY18 will be c. 3-4%. We carefully 
control our administrative cost base and 
expect administrative expenses to be around 
£150m for FY18 (2017: £132.8m). 
Commercial developments
Wilson Bowden Developments (‘WBD’) is our 
commercial development division. 
During the year, WBD completed a new 
logistics hub and a freehold sale. WBD are 
currently developing a logistics warehouse 
and an office and warehouse facility. We have 
also continued to make progress in leasing 
our retail schemes at Hinckley, and have 
completed its investment sale. 
Commercial development revenue was £61.1m 
(2016: £81.9m) with an operating profit before 
adjusting items of £10.2m (2016: £6.0m). 
After charging an £8.8m provision against a 
legacy commercial asset, we recognised an 
operating profit of £1.4m (2016: £6.0m). 
Health and safety
The health and safety of our people, 
contractors, customers and the general public 
is the Group’s number one priority.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Increased activity levels across the industry 
in terms of site openings and production 
volumes combined with shortages of skilled 
staff has contributed to an increased risk of 
accidents on sites. We remain fully committed 
to the highest standards of health and safety 
on our sites. In the year, our reportable injury 
incidence rate has decreased slightly with 
379 (2016: 385) reportable incidents per 
100,000 employees. 
The tragic events at Grenfell Tower in London 
illustrate why health and safety must always 
remain the first priority for the building 
industry. Fire safety is core to the way we plan 
and build our developments. Following the 
fire at Grenfell Tower, we conducted a review 
of our sites and continue to ensure we 
are maintaining the highest standards of 
building safety.
Delivery of our strategic objectives
We delivered on our financial targets, set in 
September 2014, of a minimum ROCE of 25% 
and a 20% gross margin for FY17 and we are 
focused on making further progress. With our 
improved Capital Return Plan, announced 
with our interim results in February 2017, we 
continue to deliver attractive cash returns.
Our key financial metrics
Our housebuilding business achieved a gross 
margin of 20.2% (2016: 19.1%) up 1.1 ppts and 
an operating margin of 17.4% (2016: 15.9%) up 
1.5 ppts reflecting the improvements we have 
driven through the business, notwithstanding 
that the high-end London market presents  
some headwinds in this regard. The Group  
delivered a gross margin of 20.0% (2016:  
18.9%) and an operating margin of 17.2% 
(2016: 15.8%) up 1.4 ppts on the prior year. 
We have achieved our ROCE target with ROCE 
increasing by 2.7 ppts to 29.8% (2016: 27.1%). 
Contributing to this growth has been our 
increased operating profitability, use of land 
creditors and the disposal of our legacy shared 
equity interests. It remains a core part of our 
strategy to drive ROCE performance further, 
in line with our fast build and sell model.
Maintaining an appropriate 
capital structure
As at 30 June 2017, the Group had a net cash 
balance of £723.7m (2016: £592.0m), ahead 
of expectations, driven by strong performance 
and the timing of land and working capital 
payments. We expect to have low levels of 
average net debt throughout the year and FY18 
year-end net cash to be around £500m.
We seek to defer payment for land purchases 
where possible to drive a higher ROCE, and 
land creditors as at 30 June 2017 were 37% 
of the owned land bank (30 June 2016: 38%). 
We continue to secure attractive deferred 
payment terms on land and expect land 
creditors as a proportion of the owned 
land bank to reduce slightly and be around 
30-35% at 30 June 2018, in line with our 
operating framework.
The Group continues to maintain an 
appropriate financial structure with 
shareholders’ funds and land creditors funding 
the longer term requirements of the business 
and with term loans and bank debt funding 
shorter term requirements for working capital. 
In December, we further strengthened working 
capital capacity by amending and extending 
our existing revolving credit facility, removing 
the £150m stepdown in facility size previously 
due in December 2017 and extending our 
£700m facility to December 2021. 
In August 2017, the Group refinanced the 
maturing US$80m US Private Placement 
(USPP) with a new USPP of £200m, taking 
advantage of the current low interest rate 
environment. This has a ten year maturity with 
a fixed coupon of 2.77% which is significantly 
lower than the maturing USPP that had a 
fixed rate of interest of 8.14%. Following these 
financing changes we expect interest costs for 
FY18 to be around £50m of which c. £15m will 
be cash interest costs.
Net tangible assets were £3,430.0m (£3.40 per 
share) of which land net of land creditors and 
work in progress totalled £3,340.7m  
(£3.31 per share).
Capital Return Plan
In February, the Board announced that, given 
the significant operational and financial 
improvements the Group has made over the 
last few years, it would improve and extend 
the existing dividend plan announced in 
September 2014. As a result, the Group has 
improved the level of ordinary dividend cover 
from three times to two and a half times, and 
thereby increased the dividend payout ratio.
When market conditions allow, ordinary 
dividends will be supplemented with the 
payment of special dividends. The Board 
proposes to pay special dividends of £175m in 
November 2017 and November 2018. 
We are therefore delighted to propose a final 
dividend of 17.1 pence per share (2016: 12.3 
pence per share) resulting in a total ordinary 
dividend for the year up 33.3% to 24.4 pence 
per share (2016: 18.3 pence per share) and 
the third of our special dividends totalling 
£175.0m, equivalent to 17.3 pence per share. 
Both dividends will be paid on 20 November 
2017 to all shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 27 October 2017.

We have started the new financial year in a good position, with £723.7m year-end net cash and a 
healthy forward order position. Our outlook for FY18 is unchanged and we continue to expect to 
deliver modest growth in wholly owned completions, with affordable completions representing a 
similar proportion of completions as FY17.
We have industry leading quality and customer service, and talented employees whose 
outstanding contribution drives our success. I am proud to lead our first class team who are all 
determined to build on our outstanding operational and financial performance. 
In FY18, we will continue to deliver our strategic objectives with a particular focus on improving 
margin, maintaining an appropriate capital structure and delivering our Capital Return Plan. 
When market conditions allow, ordinary dividends will be supplemented with the payment of 
special dividends.
