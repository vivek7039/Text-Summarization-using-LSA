Chairman’s statement
Effective risk management
Improved pricing for insurance in 2018 should 
improve the prospects for underwriting profits
Lower capacity 
auction prices in 
2017 will allow more 
effective use of 
available Helios funds.

Non-executive Chairman
Summary
• Loss before tax and impairment of 
£406,000 (2016 profit: £1,336,000)
• Adjusted net asset value at 
£1.60 per share (2016: £1.96) 
• Five acquisitions in 2017 added 
£4.4m of capacity to 2017 
underwriting year – 13% increase
• 1.5p per share total dividend 
payable (2016: 5.5p)
Your Board announces the results for 2017 
which were affected by the underwriting losses 
arising from natural catastrophes that occurred 
in 2017 and by the reduction in the value of 
the syndicate portfolio of capacity. The loss 
before impairment for the year is £406,000 
(2016 profit: £1,334,000), whilst the adjusted 
net asset value of the Group is £1.60 per share 
(2016: £1.96).
The full impact of the 2017 losses on the Helios 
portfolio of £5.8m was mitigated by the use 
of quota share and stop loss reducing the net 
loss for 2017 to £1.9m.
Underwriting profits from the two older 
underwriting years, the “off-risk” years, made 
a good contribution but the 2017 underwriting 
year in its first 12 months recognised a 
significant loss following the series of natural 
catastrophes in the second half of 2017. 
Other income arising from fees from 
reinsurers, recoveries from reinsurance 
policies and investment income have 
contributed to this year results. Total 
costs of £1.8m included the expenditure 
on protecting the portfolio using stop loss 
reinsurance and foreign exchange losses 
from the strengthening of the US$.
Strategy
The building of a portfolio of participations on 
leading Lloyd’ s syndicates remains the strategic 
objective of the Group. During 2017 the key 
developments were:
• building the portfolio of capacity to £41m 
for 2018 by acquiring a further five limited 
liability vehicles (“LLVs”);
• maintaining the quality of the portfolio 
and the outperformance of the underwriting 
results average against the Lloyd’s market 
as a whole;
• continuing to use quota share reinsurance 
to reduce the risk from the underwriting 
and to assist in the financing of the 
underwriting capital of the portfolio; and
• broadening the access to the portfolio 
to private capital by using a protected 
cell reinsurance structure.
Capacity acquired
During 2017 a further five corporate members were acquired that increased the capacity for 
the 2015 to 2017 years of account as shown below.
Year of account – £m
2015 2016 2017 2018
Capacity at 1 January 2017 32.2 33.7 32.6 41.0
Acquired during 2017 4.1 4.1 4.4 — 
Capacity at 31 December 2017 36.3 37.8 37.0 41.0
These five acquisitions in 2017 were purchased 
for a total consideration of £4.8m, of which 
£2.1m was attributed to the value of capacity 
acquired. Given the uncertainty generated as 
to valuation of LLVs in the second half of the 
year arising from the natural catastrophes, 
the flow of potential acquisitions slowed. 
With prospective 2017 underwriting year 
losses and the reduction in the value of 
capacity, there is the prospect of acquiring 
further LLVs in the future at lower prices. 
We will continue to build on the quality of the 
capacity portfolio as it is essential to acquire 
and retain the participations on the better 
managed syndicates. Annual report and financial statements 2017 — Helios Underwriting plc 5
Strategic report
Adjusted net asset value per share
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
Net tangible assets 8,835 11,787
Group letters of credit 1,532 1,922
Value of capacity 13,046 14,918
23,412 28,627
Shares in issue 14,604 14,604
Adjusted net asset value per share (£) 1.60 1.96
The Adjusted Net Asset Value has declined 
due to funding the loss and the fall in capacity 
value. In addition funds have been taken 
from tangible assets to pay for acquisitions 
which are reflected in the capacity value total. 
This portfolio value is subject to fluctuation 
and the value could recover when cash from 
underwriting activities becomes available 
at corporate member level. This basis 
of valuation is commonly used for the 
valuations of LLVs in Lloyd’s market.
Dividend
The Board recommends that the final dividend 
remains the same as last year at 1.5p per 
share (2016: final dividend of 1.5p plus a 
special dividend 4.0p, a total for 2016 of 5.5p). 
This dividend will be payable to shareholders 
on the register on 8 June 2018. If approved, 
the dividend will be paid in a single payment 
on 6 July 2018. The board has considered the 
existing dividend policy which would in normal 
circumstances have paid a special dividend 
between 20-30% of the 2015 underwriting year 
profits received. In view of the opportunities 
for acquisitions at favourable prices and the 
possibility of share buybacks (see below) the 
board believes that it is prudent to retain the 
cash for these purposes and does not 
recommend a special dividend this year.
Share Buyback and 
Whitewash Resolution
The Directors are seeking authority to purchase 
up to a maximum of 1,510,424 ordinary shares 
(being equivalent to approximately 10% of the 
Company’ s issued share capital). The proposed 
buyback(s) would only be implemented if the 
Board believes that the purchase(s) would 
enhance net asset value per share and be in 
the best interests of shareholders generally.
As the proposed buyback would result 
in an increase of the proportionate voting 
interest of each shareholder who retains their 
full shareholding following such transaction,
it gives rise to certain considerations under 
the City Code. Each of Nigel Hanbury, Hampden 
Capital Limited, Nicholas Wentworth-Stanley, 
Jeremy Evans, Sir Michael Oliver, Peter Nutting, 
Timothy Oliver and his immediate family 
members are considered by the Panel to be 
acting in concert, as the concert party, in 
respect of the Company and together, as the 
concert party are interested in 29.62% of the 
Company’s issued share capital. Were the 
aggregate interests of the concert party in 
the voting rights of the Company to reach 
30% or more as a result of the proposed 
buyback, the members of the concert party 
would be required to make a mandatory offer 
under Rule 9 of the City Code. 
The Takeover Panel may waive the 
requirement for a general offer to be made 
in accordance with Rule 9 if, amongst other 
things, the shareholders of a company who 
are independent of the person who would 
otherwise be required to make an offer, and 
any person acting in concert with it, pass an 
ordinary resolution on a poll approving such 
a waiver.
Accordingly, the Company has prepared a 
circular and related resolutions for consideration 
by the independent shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting, notice of which 
is being circulated with the Annual Report 
and financial statements.
Outlook
The objective to provide access to insurance 
exposures at Lloyd’s on quality syndicates 
continues to develop with the growth of the 
capacity portfolio and the implementation 
of a protected cell reinsurance structure for 
participation by private capital.
The 2017 underwriting year was affected by 
the worst catastrophe losses for some years, 
in addition 2016 returns were lower due to 
softening market conditions. The 2017 losses
have been fully recognised in these accounts 
so any improvement in the next two years 
will contribute to earnings. In addition firmer 
market conditions should be reflected in the 
underwriting returns in the future.
The strategy of building a capacity 
portfolio of the better available syndicates 
at Lloyd’s should allow Helios to maintain 
its outperformance of returns on capacity 
against the Lloyd’s market. The recent soft 
underwriting conditions will distinguish the 
better managed syndicates which will deliver 
top quartile performance within the Lloyd’s 
market which will reinforce the demand for 
these syndicates and assist in the recovery 
of the auction values. We see the lower 
auction values and the prospective 2017 
underwriting year losses as an opportunity 
to continue to build the portfolio of capacity 
by purchasing LLVs at lower values. 
Board 
This is my first report as your Chairman and I 
would like to pay tribute to my predecessor 
Sir Michael Oliver for his valuable contribution 
to the company since its inception. I would 
also like to welcome Edward Fitzalan-Howard 
to the board and look forward to working with 
him in the future. The 2017 underwriting year 
has fully tested our strategy and I am pleased 
to say that all the protections that have been 
developed and executed have proved to be 
successful in insulating the company from 
severe losses. In addition cash resources are 
available to take advantage of lower prices to 
enable the company to increase capacity in 
line with the existing strategy. The executive 
team are to be congratulated on achieving an 
excellent result in the circumstances.
