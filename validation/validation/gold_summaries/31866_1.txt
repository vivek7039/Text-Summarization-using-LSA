Chief Executive’s Review
Our Group strategy continues to be focused 
on the following four strategic goals:
• Increasing the size of our strategic land 
bank, including brownfield sites where 
residential development is expected; the 
tactical acquisition of sites which unlock 
future potential; and locations which will 
become key housebuilding terrain in the 
future.
• Adding value to our land bank by 
navigating what are often complex sites 
through the planning system, requiring 
a unique skill set, and selling them to 
other developers, realising attractive 
short-term margins and generating cash 
to fund our operations.
• Maximising the value from our land bank 
through housing development and direct 
sales, as well as providing housebuilding 
services to other landowners.
• Ensuring a strong and flexible balance 
sheet by maintaining borrowings at a 
manageable level through a focus on 
cash management and with a maturity 
profile appropriate to our potential 
future cash flows.
With these in mind, it gives me great 
pleasure to report on another set of robust 
results for Inland Homes, demonstrating 
strong profitability during the year ended  
30 June 2017 and a further improvement  
in both stated and EPRA net asset value at 
the year end.
Results and operations
Profit before tax and before revaluation 
of investment properties has increased 
by 15.3% to £18.1 million (2016 restated*: 
£15.7 million) with the majority of 
realisations taking place in the second 
half of the financial year, as expected and 
previously guided. Including revaluation 
of investment properties, profit before tax 
was £19.6 million (2016 restated*: £33.7 
million) reflecting the majority of the 
valuation uplift having taken place in the 
previous year on the portfolio of existing 
residential properties at our site in Wilton 
Park, Beaconsfield. The EPRA net asset 
value at 30 June 2017 was £194.4 million 
(2016 restated*: £186.3 million) and this 
translated to 96.22p per share (2016 
restated*: 92.34p). 
We operate at the more affordable point 
in the market, where homes are typically 
priced between £200,000 to £450,000 and 
the average selling price of our homes 
during the financial year was £306,000 
(2016: £337,000). Our forward sales 
at 30 June 2017 stood at £19.9 million 
and currently stand at £33.0 million. In 
addition, we have three major construction 
contracts amounting to £41.5 million on our 
Partnership Housing activity, comprising 
permissioned land that has been sold to 
Housing Associations with Inland Homes 
subsequently securing construction 
contracts to build the planned residential 
units. The Group intends to increase this 
activity and expects this to be a growing 
revenue stream in the future.

INLAND HOMES ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 30 Stock code: INL 25624.01 – 11 October 2017 4:25 PM – Proof 2
The current annualised rental income from our commercial and residential investment activities, as we continually seek to maximise the 
potential of our assets, amounts to £2.6 million (2016: £2.6 million) and we will selectively sell some of these assets in order to reduce our 
net gearing.
Our development sites are principally around the M25 and M11 corridor, as well as on the South Coast around Poole in Dorset and 
Southampton in Hampshire. We believe these areas of the market, both in terms of pricing and location, will continue to remain relatively 
stable over the medium term, largely underpinned by the structural imbalance in the housing market which is continuing to witness 
excess demand over supply. 
Land Portfolio
The Group’s land bank currently stands at 6,936 plots (2016: 6,681 plots) with 30.8% (2016: 17.4%) of the portfolio having planning 
permission or a resolution to grant planning consent. During the year ended 30 June 2017 new planning approvals and resolutions to 
grant planning approval had been received for 1,856 residential units. The current status of the land portfolio is as follows:

This last financial year was an exceptional 
period that demonstrated the full 
capabilities of the business to deliver 
planning approvals on a considerable 
number of sites and across a wide range 
of diverse projects types with varying 
levels of complexity associated with 
them. To achieve this, Inland Homes 
has drawn on its extensive experience 
within the senior management team to 
manage the challenges of site delivery, to 
meet programme timetables and enable 
approvals that the Group can either take 
forward as future constructions sites,  
or as land available for sale.
The Group operates across a diverse land 
portfolio from town centre developments 
to major regeneration projects as well as 
some redevelopment of land located in the 
greenbelt. This requires land and planning 
teams with a unique skillset and expertise 
that sets us apart from our peers. Set out 
below some are of the projects that we have 
been working on during the last year.
Regeneration and  
Greenbelt / Greenfield 
Developments
Wilton Park, Beaconsfield 
An outline planning application for up to 
350 homes as well as commercial and 
community development on this major 
developed site in the greenbelt was 
submitted in September 2017. The design 
proposals have taken longer to come to 
fruition than originally anticipated as we 
needed to ensure that the scheme met the 
requirements of this premium location 
as well as those expected by the Local 
Authority. We are already generating an 
annual rental stream of £1.0 million from 
86 existing residential properties on this 
site valued at £46.9 million and which are 
included in the accompanying financial 
statements under investment properties. In 
addition, the site generates approximately 
£0.5 million per annum from letting other 
space for storage and film production. We 
expect this 100 acre site to generate a gross 
development value of approximately £350 
million. 
Wilton Park also sits within the proposed 
East of Beaconsfield Strategic Land 
release as proposed by South Bucks 
District Council and the current application 
ensures that it can accommodate further 
development on the site. 
Cheshunt Lakeside, Cheshunt
This is currently Inland Homes’ largest 
regeneration project comprising an 
emerging masterplan for a new mixed use 
Urban Village of up to 2,000 new homes 
on 30 acres of land of which 18 acres are 
either owned or controlled by our joint 
venture company. The site sits immediately 
adjacent to Cheshunt Station (27 minutes to 
London Liverpool Street) and the proposed 
new Crossrail 2 route. The setting is 
regarded by Broxbourne Borough Council 
as a key delivery location for much needed 
new homes and employment space in the 
Borough.  Over the last year our land and 
planning team have assisted the Local 
Authority in increasing the development 
allocation from 1,000 residential units to 
approximately 2,000 units across the wider 
masterplan. The Group has a 50% interest 
in this development site and a planning 
application is expected to be submitted in 
December 2017, once we have successfully 
incorporated the requirements of key 
stakeholders and have a masterplan 
that can support the Borough through 
their Local Plan process. The resultant 
masterplan will include new community 
facilities, a new two form entry primary 
school and employment space comprising 
uses such as offices, healthcare, business, 
leisure, restaurant and retail.

Chief Executive’s Review  
Continued
Chapel Riverside, Southampton
This regeneration site was secured by 
way of a Development Agreement with 
Southampton City Council whereby Inland 
Homes has obtained outline planning 
approval for 457 apartments plus 64,000 
sq ft of commercial space with a detailed 
approval for the first phase of 72 units, 
which is now under construction. The gross 
development value of this site is expected 
to be in excess of £120 million and we 
anticipate the project will take approximately 
seven years to complete.
Abbey Wharf, Alperton, London 
A resolution to grant planning consent was 
received for a first phase of 135 apartments 
in what is a new London Housing Zone. 
This site will kick start the regeneration 
and deliver some of the key requirements 
of the Housing Zone masterplan. The site 
was sold by the Group during the financial 
year generating a profit of £6.0 million. The 
Group has also secured a £29.5 million 
construction contract and construction is 
expected to commence in December 2017.
Aston Clinton Road, Aylesbury 
Significant technical and planning 
challenges, including noise, transport and 
drainage, had to be overcome by the Inland 
Homes team in order to secure planning 
consent for 400 homes and 105,000 sq ft of 
commercial space on this site, which was 
owned by our joint venture company with 
Europa Capital. The joint venture company 
was sold in June 2017 resulting in a gain for 
the Group of £7.0 million.
Town Centre Developments
Sherbourne Wharf, Birmingham
Located 500 metres from Brindleyplace in 
Birmingham, this well-located City Centre 
site has received planning approval for the 
first two phases, which will deliver a total of 
167 canalside apartments. We submitted a 
planning application for the third and final 
phase of 87 apartments in September 2017. 
This is a dense urban site which provides an 
exciting opportunity to create a new vibrant 
waterfront destination that links in with the 
Canal and Rivers Trust plans for the area. 
It has an expected gross development value 
of £50 million.
Beaumont Works, St Albans
When Inland Homes acquired this Grade 
II Listed Building it was severely run 
down and in need of refurbishment. 
Sensitive negotiations with conservation 
officers enabled a bespoke design 
to be incorporated alongside a new 
contemporary residential building with a 
total of 58 residential units. The site was 
sold with planning consent in June 2017 for 
£7.5 million and a profit of £1.8 million.
Randalls Department Store, Uxbridge
The Group’s expertise in the development 
of brownfield urban sites was put to the test 
on this former Grade II Listed Department 
store, a local landmark, which became the 
centrepiece of a new mixed use restaurant 
and residential proposal. Detailed negotiations 
with Historic England ensured that the final 
designs allowed for a practical design that 
retained the key aspects of the department 
store. Integration of affordable housing, 
technical aspects of structure and highways, 
plus the extra complication of the retention 
and conversion of the former fire station added 
to the complexities. Planning permission for 
58 apartments and 8,000 sq ft of commercial 
space was received with some accolade from 
the local Council. The Group expects the gross 
development value to be approximately £25 
million and plans to sell the site in the current 
financial year. 
Lily’s Walk, High Wycombe
Inland Homes secured planning permission 
for 239 new private tenure apartments 
and 15,800 sq ft of commercial space on 
this site in the heart of High Wycombe. 
As a former gas works with a significant 
sloping terrain, the site presented a range 
of challenges to be overcome. An integral 
part of this site is the delivery of a major 
piece of public infrastructure known as the 
Town Centre Relief Road that forms part 
of the new road system in the town. The 
Group will shortly commence construction 
of this development having purchased the 
site post year end from its joint venture with 
CPC Group Limited. The gross development 
value of the site is approximately £75 
million and contracts have already 
been exchanged with end purchasers of 
apartments for £5.5 million. 
Wessex Hotel, Bournemouth
This planning approval has been one of 
the hardest negotiated schemes the Group 
has procured. The location is on one of 
the major routes into Bournemouth and 
forms a key gateway within the West Cliff 
conservation Area. The scheme replaces 
an existing 100 bed, run down hotel, with a 
new 100 bed hotel, basement parking plus 
two apartment buildings totalling 88 private 
apartments.

Housebuilding 
Following the strategic decision to 
bring the majority of our housebuilding 
activity in-house, the past year has also 
focused on investing in the expansion 
of our construction team. This process 
has resulted in recruitment at both head 
office and site level and, as expected, this 
investment has brought about a planned 
increase in overheads, with staff numbers 
having increased from 39 on 1 July 2016 
to 74 at the year end. This facet of the 
business will deliver improved processes 
and structures that will accommodate an 
expansion in our production. Moreover, 
by managing this construction activity 
ourselves, we can deliver cost savings over 
the long term and enable greater control 
and certainty over the delivery and timing  
of projects. 
We currently have 427 units under 
construction (including 43 included within 
a joint venture) across 12 sites of which 316 
units (74%) are being delivered in-house. 
In order to control our working capital 
requirements, our policy has always been 
to forward sell our homes. This has been 
further bolstered by engaging in land 
disposals to potential landlords with forward 
funded construction contracts which will 
have a positive and growing impact on 
revenue, profits and net borrowings.
Outlook
We are continuing to see strong demand 
for sites within our land portfolio especially 
from Housing Associations who have been 
tasked by the government to increase the 
number of homes within their portfolios. 
The Group’s strategy is to use more of 
its land bank for its own housebuilding 
activities and procure planning permissions 
in order to deliver sites that could be 
either sold outright or with the benefit of a 
construction contract, or be developed to 
extract the development contribution. 
We believe that this provides Inland Homes 
with significant flexibility and balance to 
the business through diversified revenue 
streams and therefore, against the current 
market backdrop, feel very positive about 
our ability to create and crystallise further 
value for our shareholders.
