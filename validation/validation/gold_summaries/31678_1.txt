 The Group had another strong year in FY17 , as we  
successfully implemented our strategy and delivered  
financial performance in line with our expectations.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S REVIEW
Mark Watkin Jones
Chief Executive Officer
Strategy
The Group is following a consistent 
strategy, as set out on page 16, which 
is delivering sustainable growth and 
positioning us to take advantage of 
the exciting opportunities ahead.
The visibility provided by developing 
student accommodation is central to this 
strategy. It gives us a secure and growing 
base of revenue, earnings and cash flow, 
which allows us to develop new 
businesses to enhance that growth. 
The strength of our student 
accommodation pipeline makes this an 
excellent time to pursue our strategy in 
build to rent. We can use the knowledge, 
experience and relationships we have 
developed in student accommodation over 
nearly two decades, which are all directly 
applicable in the build to rent market.
Our development pipeline will also 
provide a stream of new contracts in 
accommodation management, in both 
student and build to rent. 
Winning contracts to manage buildings 
developed by third parties is another 
exciting source of growth for this business, 
as the market is far greater than the 
buildings we develop ourselves.
People and culture
Any business is only as good as the 
people it employs, which is why we invest 
so much time and money in developing 
our people and helping them to achieve 
their potential.
Our primary focus in FY17 was on 
ensuring the Group has the leadership 
it needs to achieve its growth plans. 
We have established an Executive 
Committee to provide the executive 
leadership to the Group below Board level 
and to further the management of our 
governance responsibilities. The members 
of the Executive Committee are myself, 
Philip Byrom (CFO), Alex Pease 
(Investment Director), Jim Davies 
(MD Newmark Developments) and 
Rebecca Hopewell (CEO Fresh 
Property Group).
Performance
Revenue from continuing operations 
rose by 13.1% to £301.9 million 
(FY16: £267.0 million), contributing to 
an 18.0% increase in gross profit to 
£63.5 million (FY16: £53.8 million). 
Operating profit was 12.7% higher at 
£42.7 million (FY16: £37.9 million before 
exceptional IPO costs), representing an 
operating margin of 14.1% (FY16: 14.2%). 
Our business is strongly cash generative 
and we achieved an operating cash inflow 
of £19.2 million (FY16: £15.1 million after 
exceptional IPO costs), with a further 
£22.8 million of cash received after the 
year end, relating to forward sales we 
agreed during FY17.
Developing student accommodation 
generates our core revenue and earnings 
and the business had another excellent 
year. We completed all ten schemes on 
time (3,314 beds), maintaining our 100% 
record of delivering ahead of the start of 
the academic year. We also continued to 
refill the pipeline of development sites, 
ensuring we maintain the visibility of 
earnings that is fundamental to our 
business model.
Our accommodation management 
business, Fresh Property Group, is 
continuing to perform well. It currently has 
16,082 student beds under management 
for the 2017/18 academic year, a 30% 
increase on the number under management 
for 2016/17. The business is also expanding 
in the build to rent market and now has 
535 units under management, including 
the 322-unit scheme we completed in 
Leeds during the year.
We are successfully building a pipeline of 
development opportunities in build to rent. 
The Group has five development sites, 
which it owns or has exchanged contracts 
to acquire, and is in separate negotiations 
on several other opportunities.
The residential business also had 
a good year, completing 94 sales and 
increasing its gross margin to 16.7%, 
from 11.5% in FY16.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 The operational Board was unchanged 
during the year, and we have looked to 
invest in and empower them, as well as 
the management teams below them and 
throughout the Group. This included 
helping our people to understand how 
they contribute to the business and to 
show them the opportunities available 
within the Group, which we believe make 
us an employer of choice. As part of this, 
we have begun succession planning for 
management at Board level and below. 
Our other activities in the year 
encompassed enhancing performance 
management and improving 
communication, to drive engagement 
and collaboration across our divisions.
Sustainability
With a history dating back more than two 
centuries, it is natural for us to think for the 
long term. We therefore aim to ensure we 
are economically, socially and 
environmentally sustainable. The way 
we work is governed by a set of robust 
policies and we look to understand and 
manage the needs of our stakeholders, 
which include our people, clients, supply 
chain and shareholders, as well as wider 
society in the form of our communities 
and both the local and global environment.
More information about our approach 
to sustainability can be found on 
pages 28 to 31.
Curlew Student Trust  
portfolio sale
We have been advised by Curlew Capital 
that the Curlew Student Trust (“CST”) is in 
legal negotiations to sell a portfolio of its 
assets. CST was launched in 2013 as a 
seven-year Fund, with a strategy to 
forward fund and hold good quality 
student accommodation assets in strong 
university towns and cities across the UK. 
CST is backed by clients of CBRE Global 
Investment Partners. The sale is expected 
to exchange and complete in the next 
few weeks.
The sale transaction includes 14 schemes 
(5,124 beds) which are managed by the 
Fresh Property Group. It is expected that 
Fresh will continue to provide management 
services to the new owner for FY18, but that 
ultimately the new owner may decide to take 
the management in house. Fresh will be fully 
compensated for any unexpired contract 
periods on all of the assets should they be 
terminated early by the new owner. Should 
Fresh not be retained as property manager 
for these assets, this will not have a material 
effect on the Group’s financial performance.
Curlew Capital have advised us that, 
following the success of CST, they have 
received approval to launch a second Fund, 
Curlew Student Trust 2 (“CST 2”), backed 
again by clients of CBRE Global Investment 
Partners. CST 2 will have a similar strategy to 
CST to forward fund and hold good quality 
student accommodation assets in strong 
university towns and cities across the UK. 
CST 2 will have a 25-year life and is expected 
to be launched in January 2018. CST 2 has 
already secured two seed assets (917 beds) 
for delivery in 2020 and has ambitious growth 
plans. Fresh will be the preferred property 
manager for CST 2, which creates the potential 
for longer-term business growth for Fresh.
Outlook
I believe that Watkin Jones is 
in an excellent position. Student 
accommodation continues to provide 
strong visibility and we have growing 
momentum in build to rent. At the same 
time, our investment in our people gives us 
the leadership we need to take advantage 
of the opportunities ahead.
As noted in the Chairman’s statement on 
page 09, after careful consideration I have 
decided that it is necessary for me to step 
back from my position as Chief Executive 
Officer. The Group has reported strong 
results for FY17 and with excellent 
earnings visibility, Watkin Jones is in a 
strong position to achieve continued 
success in both student accommodation 
and build to rent. Solid foundations are in 
place for my successor to work with, 
including an excellent management team 
that has supported me over the years in 
successfully growing the business and 
who will continue to drive Watkin Jones 
forward for the long-term benefit of our 
shareholders.
