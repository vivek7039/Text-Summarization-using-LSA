 Chief Executive’s Review
Richard Kellett-Clarke
Chief Executive Officer
The failure to achieve the year end numbers is 
the result of a perfect storm of issues. Recent 
complex acquisitions, exacerbated by earn outs, 
and a time-consuming capital raise created a lot of 
work in the first half of the year and did not result 
in the customary tight integration and release of 
value. This was aggravated by a general election 
year, which served to push contract activity out 
towards the end of the financial year, and revenue 
recognition which was intended to ensure we hit 
year end targets but proved too aggressive. 
The focus since I stepped back into the CEO role, 
has been on five core changes which are expected 
to deliver benefits in the current financial year:
• The full integration of the last four acquisitions to 
deliver shareholder value. This will be completed 
during H1 2018 with a new streamlined 
organisational structure.
• Target £7m of cost savings (10%) through  
the identification of cost synergies and 
technological overlaps in the business to aid 
productivity and efficiency. Introduction of Group 
policies and procedures to increase, security, 
accountability, productivity and compliance.  
This is well advanced with major changes 
already implemented.
• A review of Group pricing and revenue 
recognition policy with external input from 
independent accountants to ensure consistency 
and clarity and improve cash conversion. 
This will be completed during H1 2018 and 
implemented by the end of 2018. It is expected 
to have an initially negative impact on revenues 
as a result of increased SaaS pricing although 
this is expected to have a medium-term benefit.
• Acceleration of our digital, mobile and web 
technology strategy in partnership with our 
customers, and a refocus of our development 
resources to concentrate on core technologies 
and reduce capital costs.
• Improve processes to reduce administration  
and improve cash collection.
Overview
It was quite unexpected to be back in this seat 
some 15 months after stepping down, but I have 
been pleased by the warmth of the reception 
from the Idox team, who have knuckled down 
in what has been a difficult few months. I am 
particularly grateful to Jane Mackie, our CFO, and 
her team who in difficult circumstances upheld the 
Company’s standards of honesty and integrity. We 
are obviously disappointed by the impact these 
matters have had on the reputation of the business 
and fully intend to restore it to full health.
“The Board is confident that the Group is well 
positioned for the current financial year, driven 
by a combination of new contract momentum, 
management and organisational changes.”
10 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 We have made rapid progress as these  
were all initiatives that were previously  
proposed, but deferred.
Public Sector Software
Post the year end we have completed a small 
reorganisation to integrate completely the recent 
acquisitions and to drive greater efficiency and more 
focus to our core public sector customer base. 
Today our services facing government and the local 
public sector aimed at improving the usability and 
quality of services, account for 72% of revenues, an 
increase of 17% on the previous year. 
The business had another strong election year 
which not only disrupted the business in the middle 
of the year with the uncertain outcome of the 
general election in May, but ended the year with the 
delayed completion of the national election system 
for Northern Ireland due to uncertainty around 
potential fresh elections, and the award of the 
e-Count contract for Malta.
We have continued to enhance our digital services 
platform and roll out the completed mobile 
application platform which aims to improve the 
customer experience and assist our customers 
in their productivity goals. The total number of 
customer solutions has now exceeded over 100. 
Building on this, consultation has begun on the 
next generation of web based solutions for local 
government which is scheduled for delivery in 
incremental stages starting in 2019 through to 2020.
Overall, we have continued to see further  
market share gains with 108 new local authority 
customers, 7 new system sales and 11 managed 
service customers.
Our Transport solutions have delivered and awaiting 
sign from the two major systems they have been 
working on for the past two years in Perth, Australia 
and Manchester. This has led to cost overruns but 
the resultant ground-breaking innovation in these 
solutions has resulted in further international interest 
and the closure of the Bristol Transport contract in 
Q1 2018. 
These solutions offer real time adaptive traffic 
signalling, dynamic timetabling and printing, alters 
and monitoring solutions for multi modal journeys, 
dynamic stand management, performance 
monitoring of journey times, bus lateness and air 
quality, as well as “green wave” solutions to control 
vehicle speed for current and autonomous vehicles. 
They represent our long-term investment in smart 
City solutions, which we believe represents an 
attractive opportunity for the Group.
Facilities management (‘FM’) had another good year 
and has now started to work more closely with our 
health business to deliver FM solutions linked with 
asset tracking to hospitals.

6PM
Post-acquisition integration of 6PM quickly 
uncovered a number of issues which resulted in:
• The restatement of 6PM’s audited accounts  
due to material errors which were identified in 
due diligence.
• Discovery of additional unaccrued costs.
• Incurring one-off legal, auditing and consulting 
costs to expedite discipline in the business.
• Increased management time and resources to 
achieve the partial integration which detracted 
attention from the core business.
• The points above resulted in a reassessment of 
forecasts and an agreed impairment of £2.7m to 
the carrying value of goodwill in the accounts.
• Continued and extended discussions with our 
auditors over the recognition of revenues in 2017. 
The technical discussion was a complex area 
which focused on recognition of revenue either at 
a point in time or over time, with the difference in 
revenue and profits being £1m. Management had 
an expectation that 6pm licences would be able 
to be recognised at a point in time. In practice 
this was not possible and 6PM licence revenue 
continued to be recognised over time rather 
than at a point in time. This has resulted in the 
£1m revenue and profits which was expected by 
management to be recognised in 2017 not being 
recognised in the period and carried forward to 
future periods. 
Now this is all behind us, we are concentrating 
on reviewing how we sell to the NHS to improve 
sales performance, time to closure and revenue 
recognition which may affect revenues in the  
short-term.
Digital 
The Digital business had an unexciting year 
in revenue terms but was very proud to have 
completed and delivered new designs and 
approaches for a diverse customer base including 
the Church of England, as well as several well-
known premier league football clubs. It has started 
to work with both the transport, FM, and local 
government areas of the business to improve 
the usability of customer web sites and deliver 
better customer experiences and more relevant 
information, which is all part of our strategy to use 
digital technology to deliver better public services. 
Content
The Compliance part of our business has been 
merged at the end of this year with our Grant’s 
business as they are both content and services 
businesses. The combined Content business unit 
has stabilised after a poor performance in the 
prior year and grew revenues by 15% in 2017. New 
products this year included new modules to help 
corporates and local authorities with the education 
of staff around the European GDPR standard. 
Content has continued to take market share with 
strong sales for our Research connect platform.
Engineering Information  
Management (EIM)
Engineering revenue declined slightly by 8% year 
on year, the result of a more stringent revenue 
recognition policy and delayed completion of 
projects. The business has continued to invest in 
its SaaS platform which has received good reviews 
and is expected to be launched in the second half of 
2018 as an upgrade to the current system.
12 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Markets
Looking forward we see no material change in all 
our markets. We saw delays in decision making 
processes in 2017 as a result of the general election 
but no discernible impact from Brexit. The oil and 
gas market has seen a slight uptick as a result of 
the strengthening price of oil but this is yet to turn 
into substantial growth. The Content business 
remains a slower growth, lower margin business in 
highly competitive markets. Public sector customers 
continue to look at our digital, mobile and web 
offerings and we continue to see good growth in  
the use of these services.
Objectives for 2018
The Group’s strategy remains to focus on the wider 
public sector (with the addition of Health last year). 
We intend to accelerate our international ambitions, 
and having consolidated our position in the UK 
elections market we are looking to expand this area 
of the business outside the UK.
The short-term focus has been to rectify the issues 
which developed in 2017. To that end we have 
started and will have completed by the end of 
H1 2018 the full integration of all the business we 
have bought in the past two years. This will result 
in some significant cost saving and improvements 
in quality standards across the Group as well as 
helping us to leverage our intellectual property.
This year will see the launch of a new Group 
web site which integrates all our solutions, 
capabilities and technologies to aid cross selling 
and to leverage the capability of the business. The 
investment strategy will result in an increased focus 
on our web cloud and smart city solutions. 
The Board believes government bodies must invest 
in digital solutions to improve the quality of their 
services and continue their drive for improvements 
in productivity and accessibility. Idox is unique in 
having an extensive range of capabilities which 
it can integrate to deliver quick outcomes and is 
looking forward to building stronger links with its 
customers to deliver true innovation to the market 
with their help.

Outlook
In the early months of the new financial year the 
business has had an encouraging start with the 
majority of the delayed contracts from last year 
being signed; the Bristol transport solution, the 
e-Count solution for the Government of Malta, and 
new solutions for the Isle of Man, Western Isles, 
Croydon and the South Downs National Park and 
Dorset Councils partnership. 
2018 will see a decisive move towards a change in 
product pricing and a focus on cash conversion; we 
believe this will deliver stronger future growth and 
a higher quality earnings, although in the short-
term it will depress revenue growth in 2018. We 
expect margins to improve following the cost saving 
measures being targeted and the completion of 
integration activity. 
Overall, the Board is confident that the Group is 
well positioned for the current financial year, driven 
by a combination of new contract momentum, 
management and organisational changes, 
savings made since the year end and the full year 
contributions from the 2017 acquisitions.
I remain confident of Idox’s prospects and believe 
that the Group has good growth opportunities, 
through its continued focus on digital  
transformation and channel shift in the public 
sector, increasing market shares, ensuring existing 
acquisitions are fully bedded in, cross selling, and 
geographical expansion.
