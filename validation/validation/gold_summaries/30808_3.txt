 06 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
This is expected to be the last BGEO annual 
report. The forthcoming demerger of the Group, 
announced in July 2017, reflects both the end 
of an era and the start of a new one. The Board 
and management team are convinced that  
we are on the right strategic path. In fulfilling  
our fiduciary duties to you, the Board regularly 
examines strategic options. We elected to split 
the Group into two independent businesses: 
the Bank and an investment vehicle, which  
we call Georgia Capital.
If we do it right, we could be at the eve of  
a major jump in value creation. We will have 
created three large groups, all quoted on the 
London Stock Exchange, each with their own 
Board, management, and strategic logic. It is 
an opportunity to deliver better service to our 
clients, better development to our employees, 
more growth of the corporate sector of the 
country, and finally significant financial return  
to our shareholders. Each management team 
and the Boards will focus on the development 
of one kind of business.
In my letter, I have traditionally followed a  
set structure. First, a few words on Georgia; 
then on the strategy of the Group; and then  
on people – Board and top management.  
Irakli Gilauri, our CEO, and others will expand 
on the detail of the businesses.
Economically, Georgia is doing exceptionally 
well in a difficult region and world. I believe 
three key factors make the Georgian situation 
positive in the long term:
1. Macroeconomic stability. Prudent monetary 
and fiscal policies have led to almost 5% 
real GDP growth during 2017. This has 
allowed the first ever issuance of offshore 
local currency bonds by Bank of Georgia.

2. Many healthy and developing sectors, in line 
with Government policies:
a. The financial sector, of which we are part
b. Infrastructure development, especially in 
the power sector
c. Healthcare, where we participate in the 
universal healthcare access policies of 
Government
d. Finally, and more long term, the 
Government has a programme to 
improve education, and to make the 
public sector more efficient.
3. Good Government
a. Strong anti-corruption policies. According 
to Transparency International, Georgia 
has maintained its ranking as a low 
bribery environment — on a par with 
many European Union member states
b. Georgia’s ease of doing business ranking 
was 9th out of 190 countries in the world, 
in 2018, up from 16th last year. Here 
again an excellent result
c. Fiscal development. The corporate tax 
reforms, effectively eliminating corporate 
income tax for all re-invested or retained 
earnings, started at the beginning of  
the year and have already yielded GEL 
600-650 million cash buffer for corporate 
re-investment in the first year on the 
policy’s adoption. The reform efforts also 
envisage capital market development 
and pension reform. Georgia is on the 
right path, and these are developments 
which take time
d. Reduction of the fiscal deficit. The 
Government is determined to reduce  
its fiscal deficit, on the back of reducing 
non-essential current spending. The 
2018 draft budget is an illustration  
that Government delivers on its 
commitments; as was the case  
in 2017.
The proof of this economic progress lies in  
the fact that we were able do the first ever  
Lari Eurobond issuance and that Moody’s has 
upgraded both Georgia and Bank of Georgia  
to a level two notches below investment grade. 
The strategy of creating a “mini Singapore” 
within the region is moving forward day by day. 
Singapore was not created in one day.
Politically, things are as calm as they can be 
with Russia. The New York Times reported  
last year on Russia’s attempts to provoke 
Georgia on the boundaries of Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia – all true; but we also see that 
Russia is doing more business with Georgia, 
specifically in terms of transport links and 
increased tourism flows. Elsewhere, Turkey 
remains Georgia’s largest trade partner, whilst 
the development of trading links with Iran  
are likely to take more time than we originally 
thought. At the same time, Georgia signed a 
free trade agreement with China and now has 
access to a market of 1.4 billion consumers, 
with zero tariffs, without additional customs 
fees and without any transition period.
Internally, it is important to remember that 
Georgia is still a pluralist and free country. It is 
taking the habits of democracies, albeit with 
one party dominance: historically the UNM 
party, and Georgian Dream now. We have a 
Government which is supportive and has very 
competent public servants. Finally, investors 
should not forget that the United States and  
the European Union exercise strong external 
checks and balances – they do not want to 
lose Georgia as a rare democratic success 
story. They showed their confidence in the 
country by granting Georgia visa-free entry  
to the 26 countries of the Schengen Area. 07 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC

Information
The thinking behind our decision to break-up  
the Group into two separate businesses, each 
expected to be quoted on the premium segment 
of the London Stock Exchange, deserves to be 
explained.
It did not come from the analysis of a 
conglomerate discount, and the expectation 
that we would see a valuation bump because of 
the transaction. The value creation boost for the 
two entities is derived from our belief that we will 
run them better— with higher ROE and higher 
growth. The logic is simple: first, complexity 
creates confusion, simplicity creates focus. 
Second, each entity will be freer to pursue its 
own growth strategy without worrying about 
“the Group”. We can already see the effects  
of this decision. One example is our insurance 
subsidiary which has already signed a number 
of distribution agreements with banks other  
than the Bank of Georgia. This might not have 
happened if we had decided to stay in the 
“previous structure”.
Both entities have substantial potential of 
earnings and sales growth.
The Bank is repositioning its portfolio away from 
straight lending to corporates which require 
capital and see their margins diminishing. It 
behooves us to find innovative ways to serve 
the corporate segment much more profitably. 
We are also moving into the high net-worth 
segments, where we can attract wealth  
from the region. We will continue to reduce 
costs. Finally, digital technologies offer us an 
opportunity that we have not yet exploited.  
The Bank has a very good management team 
with Kaha Kiknavelidze as its leader, and they 
are at work on this strategy. I will become 
Chairman of the Bank and this will be my  
only Board appointment.
The non-banking business within BGEO will 
become an investment company — Georgia 
Capital — which will include real estate, energy, 
utility, beverages, and insurance. It will also have 
listed stakes in the healthcare business and the 
Bank. The value proposition to investors is “the 
best vehicle for emerging growth opportunities in 
Georgia, selected by people with unsurpassed 
understanding of the local landscape, and 
managers/entrepreneurs”. Georgia Capital  
will be run like a private equity fund with one 
exception. The interest of its investors will be 
aligned with those of its “Partners”. In fact, its 
CEO will be paid exclusively in shares vesting 
over six years, and his executive team will have  
a similar compensation structure. Irakli Gilauri will 
leave the Group and the Bank, to head this 
company as Chairman and CEO. The Board is 
made up of old hands, such as David Morrison 
and Kim Bradley and a number of new recruits: 
Caroline Brown, William Huyett, Massimo 
Salvadori and Jyrki Talvitie.
The healthcare company, GHG, is a stand-alone 
entity today, with its own Board and separate 
stock market listing. It has much potential that 
you can read about in its own annual report.
Board quality and composition have been  
one of my main preoccupations: we have an 
opportunity to build a new Board for Georgia 
Capital and to reinforce the Boards of the Bank 
and the healthcare company. We have tried to 
prioritise skills and experience as well as gender 
diversity. We need Board members who will 
spend time on the ground in Georgia. We have 
attracted Cecil Quillen to the Bank’s Board and 
are actively seeking an additional member. All  
of our Board members are T-shaped, capable 
of broad judgement and all bring a speciality to 
the company. The composition of the two new 
Boards and the experience and qualifications  
of their members are set forth on page 19 of 
this Report. 
Unfortunately, at the outset, we will still have 
only one woman on each of our boards. Our 
goal is to correct that yesterday. We are still 
seeking to achieve the diversity targets at board 
level expected of a company of our size, and as 
chairman, I make this a personal priority. It has 
been a war for talent.
Corporate culture and human capital have 
increasingly become the cornerstone of our 
success. We would not be able to breakup  
if we had not developed capable leaders to 
take over. One of the key components of our 
talent or human resource development strategy 
has been our incentive system. Its intent is  
to incentivise management to create value  
on a long-term basis: more than 85% of 
management’s compensation is in shares  
that vest over a three-to-five-year period – 
discouraging quick earnings temptations.
This year we have moved further into changing 
our corporate culture in every one of the entities. 
We want to go from solo performance executives 
to executives who thrive on teamwork. We have 
instituted personal development programmes 
starting at the very top and cascading to the 
lower level of the hierarchy. Meritocracy and trust 
are what we aim to achieve. This starts with top 
managers’ behaviour and talk. It is reinforced by 
training programmes which teach both 
self-development, how to give and receive 
feedback, as well as how to dialogue rather  
than impose. All this will not be enough if good 
behaviour is not encouraged and bad behaviour 
not tolerated. The Board and I take a particular 
interest in seeing this through.
Before closing, I would like to thank Irakli Gilauri 
for his leadership as Chief Executive Officer. 
During his tenure at BGEO, Irakli has taken  
a Georgia quoted bank and transformed it  
into the organisation with multiple businesses 
which we have today. He did not do it alone.  
He attracted and developed many executives 
who all lead their own businesses today, and 
are developing in turn a set of new leaders.  
His final act will be to achieve the break-up 
successfully. The Board of Directors and I are 
truly grateful for his leadership over the years  
he has been with the company.
In closing, I would like to thank our investors.  
It is because of your trust that we were able to 
achieve all that has been achieved. You will now 
have a choice of which parts of the business 
you will hold – I hope that you will continue to 
hold both.
