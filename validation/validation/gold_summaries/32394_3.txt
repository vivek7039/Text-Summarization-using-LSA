03 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to be able to report on 
another year of solid progress for 
Castleton.  Following the acquisitive 
growth of FY2015 and FY2016, FY2017 
has been a year of consolidation as 
we put in place firm foundations for 
the Group to build on its position as a 
successful niche player in software and 
IT managed services within the public 
sector market place. The acquisition 
of seven small companies brings great 
rewards but also significant integration 
efforts. Despite early teething issues 
previously noted, I’m delighted to say 
that the business has now dealt with 
these and as we enter our fourth year, we 
fully expect the company to demonstrate 
its growth potential.   
With respect to the year under review, 
I am encouraged that we have 
demonstrated our ability to improve 
the mix of sales as the Company has 
successfully transitioned to targeting 
multiyear SaaS software revenues 
whilst continuing to grow our overall 
sales. A key success in the year has 
been clearly demonstrating the highly 
cash generative nature of our business 
model which facilitated a reduction in our 
net debt. 
 
The Board
There have been changes at Board 
level as the Group puts in place our 
foundations for future growth.  
Dean Dickinson joined the Board as 
CEO on 31 October 2016, replacing Ian 
Smith who became Executive Deputy 
Chairman.  Dean was previously 
Managing Director of Advanced 
Business Solutions, part of Advanced 
Computer Software Group Limited 
(previously Advanced Computer 
Software plc (“ ACS”)), where he led the 
impressive growth of the Public Sector 
and Enterprise division following the 
acquisition of COA Solutions in 2010. 
Dean was part of the senior management 
team that sold ACS to Vista Private Equity 
for £725 million in March 2015. 
Caro Bell resigned from the Board as 
Operations Director on 30 August 2016 
having joined in November 2015 and 
Davinder Sanghera resigned from the 
Board as Chief Operations Officer on 
16th January 2017 having joined when 
Documotive was acquired by Castleton 
in November 2014. Davinder was 
appointed as Chief Operations Officer on 
9 April 2015. I would like to thank them 
both for the hard work they have put in 
to help make Castleton the company it 
is today.
Opportunity / Outlook
The year has primarily been one of 
consolidation and we continue to 
see enormous potential to become 
the go-to supplier for software and IT 
services in the social housing market. 
There remain significant cross-selling 
opportunities within the customer base 
in order to provide our customers with 
the technology and services that they 
require. The low penetration of our 
comprehensive product and service set 
across our customer base combined with 
a healthy pipeline of new business gives 
me confidence for the year ahead.
With the team currently in place, a 
broad customer base, a wide range of 
products and services and solid cash 
flows enabling repayment of debt, I am 
confident of our future success and I 
expect that the Group will show further 
growth when it next reports.
