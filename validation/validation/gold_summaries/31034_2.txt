Ov ERv IEw At a Glance
We operate our business through two divisions that reflect the principal routes 
to market for our products: Profiles and Building Plastics.
PROFILES DIVISION
The Profiles division manufactures extruded rigid PVC 
profiles and foam PVC products. We make rigid and foam 
products using virgin PVC compound, the largest 
component of which is resin. Our rigid products also 
include recycled PVC compound, produced at our market 
leading recycling facility.
Rigid PVC profiles are sold to third-party fabricators, 
who produce windows, trims, cavity closer systems, patio 
doors and conservatories for their customers.
There are broadly four types of fabricator. Trade frame 
fabricators supply finished products to tradesmen or small 
retail outlets. New build fabricators supply and install the 
products they make for house builders. Commercial 
fabricators supply and install products used in applications 
such as office space and education facilities. Finally, retail 
fabricators make products for sale via their own retail 
operation, which may be a large national business, or a 
small company servicing the local community. Most of 
Eurocell’s customers are trade frame fabricators, although 
new build is becoming increasingly important.
Fabricators have production facilities which are customised to 
the window or door system they make. As a result, fabricators 
predominately buy profiles from a single supplier, which in turn 
creates a stable and loyal customer base.
Foam PVC products are used for roofline and are 
supplied to customers through our nationwide branch 
network in the Building Plastics division (see opposite).
As such, all of our manufacturing margin is recorded within 
the Profiles division, which therefore also benefits from 
expansion of the branch network.
The Profiles division also includes S&S Plastics and Vista; 
businesses acquired in 2015 and 2016 respectively. S&S 
supplies plastic injection moulding products and services 
for use in windows and certain other markets. Vista 
manufactures composite and PVC entrance doors, which 
are sold to third parties either direct or via the Building 
Plastics division.
OUR ROUTE TO MARKET
Our sales and distribution strategy is implemented through 
our cross functional sales and business development teams, 
which target the key decision makers in the supply chain. The 
key decision makers include fabricators, installers, 
developers, architects and local authorities. By influencing 
the influencers we earn the loyalty of our customers by 
helping them grow their businesses.
