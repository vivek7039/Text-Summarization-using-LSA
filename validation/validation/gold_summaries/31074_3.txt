 Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report that Circassia made good progress  
in 2017, achieving significant growth following the major 
changes to its business the prior year. With its investment 
in the allergy field halted, Circassia has focused resolutely 
on building its respiratory franchise, and consequently has 
transitioned into a very different business in a relatively short 
period. Circassia is now highly commercially focused, with  
a broad sales infrastructure, which it plans to expand further 
through a refocused investment strategy, and a portfolio  
of marketed products. 
Building strategic momentum
In 2016, the Board reviewed and reconfirmed Circassia’s strategy of 
building a self-sustaining specialty pharmaceutical company focused 
on respiratory disease. At the end of 2016, the Company significantly 
expanded its US commercial platform, both to increase revenues  
from its in-house NIOX
®
 products and to attract in-licensing, partnering 
and acquisition opportunities. This growth strategy proved successful, 
and in 2017 Circassia established a flagship US partnership with 
AstraZeneca for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
products Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
. With the collaboration making good 
progress, Circassia plans to build on this momentum by deploying  
a refocused investment strategy pursuing a similar approach in China. 
By leveraging its existing presence in the country to establish an initial 
sales force, Circassia plans to boost its NIOX
®
 revenues and provide  
a commercialisation option for third-party products in this major market. 
Refocused investment strategy
Under its refocused strategy, Circassia intends to reallocate  
its resources and complete its transformation into a commercial 
business. The Company plans to fund commercial investment  
through a combination of growing revenues, corporate cost 
containment and reductions in research and development (R&D) 
expenditure by seeking to out-license / partner its respiratory pipeline 
of directly substitutable generic products and novel formulations of 
currently approved drugs. These development candidates are based 
on approved molecules, thereby reducing their risk profile, and the 
Company plans to initiate discussions with a number of potential 
partners. This strategy will allow Circassia to retain a stake in the 
products’ future potential success whilst utilising third-party financing 
to progress the programmes through development. The Company 
will continue to invest in its R&D, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, 
quality and regulatory activities supporting its US COPD products  
and global NIOX
®
 franchise.  
Circassia has focused resolutely on building  
its respiratory franchise, and consequently  
has transitioned into a very different business  
in a relatively short period.

During the past year Circassia has made significant strategic  
progress, and with its refocused investment strategy the Company 
plans to complete its transition into a commercial business in the 
coming months. As a result, in a period of just two years Circassia  
will have transformed from an R&D-focused organisation into  
a growing commercial business with increasing revenues  
and global commercial infrastructure. 
Significant operational progress
Throughout 2017 , the Company’s operational execution has 
underpinned this strategic progress. Following the establishment  
of its collaboration with AstraZeneca, Circassia rapidly doubled the 
size of its US field force, recruiting, training and launching the enlarged 
team in under two months. This new sales team has performed well, 
and at the end of the year Tudorza
®
 prescriptions were significantly 
ahead of the declining trend established prior to Circassia’s full 
promotion and are set for future growth. In parallel, Circassia’s global 
commercial team continued to grow NIOX
®
 revenues, while the 
R&D team filed for additional NIOX
®
 approvals. The Company also 
advanced its broader pipeline, in-licensing novel nebuliser technology 
from Philips and preparing several programmes for clinical studies, 
positioning the products for potential out-licensing / partnering under 
Circassia’s refocused investment strategy. 
Evolving team
The rapid changes to Circassia’s business are reflected in the make-
up of its team. During 2017 , the commercial group grew substantially, 
accounting for over 75% of the Company’s headcount at the end of 
the year, while the R&D team was reduced by approximately 40%. 
This changing profile also extends to the Board. Circassia recently 
welcomed new Non-Executive Directors Jo Le Couilliard, Sharon 
Curran and Dr Heribert Staudinger, who bring significant commercial, 
specialty pharmaceutical and respiratory development experience to 
the Company. At the same time, the Board thanks Dr Jean-Jacques 
Garaud and Marvin S Samson for their invaluable advice and strategic 
counsel, and wishes them well on their retirement at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. 
Positioned for growth
With a period of extensive change nearing completion, Circassia  
is emerging as a strong, commercially-focused specialty pharmaceutical 
business. The Company’s revenues doubled in 2017 and are positioned 
for further growth. During the coming year, Circassia plans to drive  
sales in its NIOX
®
 franchise, building on positive new recommendations 
issued by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE). The Company will also benefit from a full year’s revenues from 
its Tudorza
®
 collaboration. In the coming year, Circassia anticipates 
exercising its option to acquire the full US commercial rights to  
Tudorza
®
 from AstraZeneca and looks forward to its partner filing  
for Duaklir
®
 approval. 
During 2018, Circassia intends to leverage the ongoing momentum  
in its business, continuing its transition towards self-sufficiency. It plans  
to extend its commercial platform in China and seek additional third-party 
products to commercialise through its specialty infrastructure. Having 
undergone a period of difficult decisions and great change, Circassia’s 
ambition to build a world-class global specialty pharmaceutical company, 
creating significant shareholder value, remains stronger than ever.
