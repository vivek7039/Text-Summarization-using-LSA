CHIEF ExECut IvE’S REvIEW
Overview
I am pleased to report that our financial 
and operational performance has 
improved significantly this year. 
These results reflect the benefits 
which have been realised following 
implementation of the recovery plan that 
was put in place last financial year. The 
recovery plan is now complete and with 
the business stabilised, revenue growing, 
a lower cost and asset base, improved 
systems and management information, 
we have a strong platform for future 
profitable growth.
Results
Revenue increased by 12.2% to 
£369.4m (2016: £329.1m). During the 
year we have improved the customer 
experience, increased asset availability 
and restructured our sales activities. On 
a constant currency basis, and excluding 
the impact of planned disposals, revenue 
increased by 6.7%. In the second half of 
the year core hire revenue was stronger 
despite the disposal of hire assets and 
the consequent transfer of revenues to 
partnered services. Secondary revenues, 
including training and consumable sales, 
increased strongly.
Gross margins declined primarily as a 
result of the revenue mix, which included 
an increase in lower margin partnered 
services and disposal revenues as we 
optimised our hire fleet. Overhead 
costs were tightly controlled during the 
year, with the UK regional operations 
restructured into two divisions in order 
to increase efficiency and reduce costs. 
Adjusted profit before tax
 1
 increased 
by 224.0% to £16.2m (2016: £5.0m) 
benefitting from lower interest costs 
due to the lower net debt
 2
, and an 
improved performance from joint venture 
operations. Profit before tax was £14.4m 
(2016: loss £57.6m). The prior year result 
was affected by the write off of goodwill 
and exceptional costs. Adjusted earnings 
per share
 3
 increased to 2.44 pence  
(2016: 0.79 pence). 
We continue to focus 
on our customers’ 
experience

Strategy
Speedy provide safe and reliable hire 
equipment and services to enable the 
successful delivery of customer projects. 
Approximately 60% of our revenues 
are derived from products we own and 
hire out to customers. The remainder of 
our revenues come from our partnered 
services division, where we re-hire 
equipment from other providers in 
order to meet customer demand, and 
secondary revenues such as transport, 
consumables, fuel, inspection and 
training. Our customers range from large 
multinational corporations, with whom 
we have framework contracts, to local 
builders; during the year we traded with 
over 50,000 customers. 
We operate in a highly competitive and 
fragmented marketplace with a number  
of national, regional and local competitors. 
Our strategy is designed to differentiate 
us from the competition in the different 
customer segments in which we operate, 
principally through adopting a customer 
focussed approach designed to address 
our varying customers’ needs.
Our approach is to:
 > Provide first class customer experience, 
so that everything we do is focussed  
on the customer 
 > Put innovation at the heart of 
everything we do
 > Cultivate strong client relationships, 
that build loyalty for long term 
sustainable profitable growth
We have mapped out our customer 
journey in detail this year and are 
implementing action plans to improve our 
performance at all stages. In late 2016 we 
launched customer satisfaction surveys, 
by text and email, in order to obtain 
feedback on our performance directly 
from our customers. The results have 
provided us with valuable feedback on 
areas to improve. 
ROCE
 4
 has improved significantly this 
year to 7.7% (2016: 3.2%); excluding 
disposals ROCE
 4
 was 8.4% (2016: 3.0%). 
We will continue to drive this measure 
through optimising our hire fleet by 
only purchasing assets which provide 
the right return, and disposing of lower 
utilised assets or procuring these 
through our partnered services offering. 
We will invest in growing our non-hire 
revenues which are less capital intensive, 
including training, consumable sales 
and inspection, in order to fully utilise 
our existing fixed depot overhead. All 
overhead costs will continue to be tightly 
controlled.
We will review both organic and 
acquisitive opportunities in value 
enhancing areas in order to realise our 
strategic objectives. 
Capital allocation
The Board is committed to ensuring  
the efficient allocation of capital. 
We have significantly reduced our 
net debt
 2
 this year to £71.4m (2016: 
£102.6m), which includes the proceeds 
from the sale of heavy plant of £14.4m, 
and is after the acquisition of specialist 
lifting business Lloyds British for £3.8m. 
Net debt
 2
 to EBITDA
 1
 has reduced to 
1.13x (2016: 1.93x). This reduction 
is a result of improved controls over 
capital expenditure, disposals of under-
utilised assets and good working capital 
management. 
The Group has a strong balance sheet and 
substantial headroom under its banking 
facilities, which expire in September 
2019. With a clear strategy for sustainable 
profitable growth, the Board will regularly 
review organic growth opportunities, 
value enhancing acquisitions, and 
shareholder returns to ensure it operates 
with an efficient capital structure.

CHIEF ExECut IvE’S REvIEW CONTINUED
We have fully integrated the acquisition 
of Lloyds British into the business and 
have rationalised the number of Lloyds 
British depots, re-locating some into 
our existing network. We have already 
realised a number of further revenue 
and cost synergies. Lloyds British 
complements Speedy’s existing lifting, 
testing and training businesses and is 
enhancing Speedy’s overall offering to  
its customers. 
During the year we launched our vision 
of becoming the best company to do 
business with in our sector and the best 
to work for, and have further developed 
our strategy to help us achieve these 
aims.
We have improved the customer 
experience in a number of ways 
including through embedding new 
customer feedback technology that 
enables customers to review our service 
in real time and at a local level. This 
feedback gives us the opportunity to 
respond immediately to any issues that 
may arise. We have also launched an 
internal initiative made up of four key 
programmes that ensure our people 
understand, and can contribute to our 
strategic vision: promoting our brand 
proposition; improving customer 
satisfaction; enhancing internal advocacy 
and engagement; and delivering better 
systems, processes and management 
information. These programmes are 
monitored and reported on monthly at 
the Executive Board and are improving 
business performance.
Our focus on strong customer 
relationships has enabled us to win and 
renew a number of contracts with our 
larger customers, including a contract 
renewal, and scope extension with 
Carillion Plc, which in total could be 
worth up to £45m over three years, and 
renewals with Babcock and Morgan 
Sindall Plc. Whilst there is some market 
uncertainty in the lead up to Brexit and 
the general election we are now well 
placed to deliver sustainable profitable 
growth. 
Operational review
uK and ireland 
The UK and Ireland business contributed 
92.8% of Group revenues. Revenue 
increased by 11.1% to £342.9m (2016: 
£308.7m). Partnered services revenue 
increased 15.0% to £52.2m (2016: 
£45.4m), reflecting revenue from the 
heavy plant disposal which transferred to 
partnered services, and an improvement 
in revenue from larger customers. Total 
revenues, excluding asset disposals, 
increased 6.4%.
Gross margins on core hire revenue 
declined slightly over the period 
reflecting the competitive market 
environment, offset by improvements 
in asset utilisation, the lower hire fleet 
and consequently lower depreciation 
charges. Overhead costs fell by £1.6m, 
after absorbing £4.3m of bonus costs 
(2016: £1.0m) and the costs of Lloyds 
British. The regional operating divisions 
were restructured into two during the 
year to improve efficiency and enhance 
accountability and empowerment; this 
has resulted in cost savings and an 
improved operational performance.
EBITA
1
 increased to £22.0m (2016: 
£14.5m) before central costs of £4.8m 
(2016: £5.1m). 
We have introduced a more stringent 
governance process for capital 
expenditure decisions, and improved our 
asset utilisation by c.7% to an average 
for the year of 51.5%. As a result, the 
hire fleet has been reduced by 11.4% to 
£186.8m (2016: £210.8m) including the 
sale of the Group’s heavy plant for a total 
consideration of £14.4m in September 
2016. The fleet was sold to Ardent with 
whom we entered into a five-year re-hire 
agreement, with an option to extend for a 
further two years. Our hire fleet remains 
the largest of its type in the UK and 
Ireland, and combined with our partnered 
services offering we are proud to offer our 
customers the ability to hire a full range 
of products.
 “
Whilst we have made  
a solid start to the year, 
the market remains 
competitive. With the 
business now stabilised 
and a strong balance 
sheet, we are well 
positioned to take 
advantage of market 
opportunities and 
continue to deliver 
sustainable profitable 
growth.” Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

In the Middle East our business is 
primarily with national government 
clients in the Oil and Gas market in 
Abu Dhabi. In spite of low oil prices the 
business has grown this year as projects 
have fully mobilised and new work has 
been secured. Revenue grew 29.9% 
(12.7% on a constant currency basis) 
to £26.5m (2016: £20.4m) of which 
approximately 50% is partnered services. 
Gross margins have increased slightly 
and overheads have reduced. As a result, 
EBITA
1
 has increased to £2.1m (2016: 
£0.6m). Of this improvement £0.2m 
related to favourable exchange rate 
movements. 
The Group operates a joint venture in 
Kazakhstan which has performed well this 
year following cyclical shutdown activity. 
Profit from JV operations increased to 
£1.7m (2016: £0.7m).
Safety and sustainability
We have an industry leading approach to 
safety and sustainability and continue  
to promote safety related topics with our 
customers through our ‘Intelligent Safety’ 
campaign. We consistently report the 
lowest accident and injury rates in our 
sector and have recently implemented 
an ‘app’ to facilitate reporting of all 
health and safety related matters and 
recommendations. During the year we 
were pleased to be awarded our third 
RoSPA Gold Medal, were accredited to 
Achilles Building Confidence with a 5-star 
rating for the fourth year running, and 
have maintained our 5-star Achilles RISQS 
accreditation for the second year running. 
Our vehicle fleet is accredited to FORS 
Gold standard nationally. 
We were the first company in our sector 
to achieve the ISO 50001 accreditation 
for energy saving. We work with suppliers 
to minimise waste coming into the 
business through reducing packaging 
where possible, and have identified waste 
streams that enable us to break down 
and re-cycle end of life assets at the 
point of disposal. Our customers demand 
lower carbon emitting products, and our 
purchasing policy is to opt for greener 
assets to satisfy this need.
People
The Group’s headcount at 31 March 2017 
was 3,745 (2016: 3,644) including  
176 employees following the acquisition 
of Lloyds British. Employee numbers in  
the UK and Ireland business reduced 
by 116 following the operational 
restructuring and efficiency programmes, 
whilst in the Middle East numbers increased 
by 41 as a result of increasing revenue. 
We undertook a full employee 
engagement survey during September 
with a commitment to running this 
on an annual basis. The survey was 
well received and scored highly in its 
management and engagement indices, 
whilst identifying a number of areas for 
improvement. We have implemented a 
Group action plan as well as local action 
plans to help us achieve our vision of 
becoming the best company to work for  
in our sector. 
The significantly improved results we are 
reporting this year would not have been 
possible without the continued passion 
and hard work of all of our people. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank 
all my colleagues for their support and 
dedication during the year.

Outlook
These results demonstrate the success 
of our turnaround plan with significant 
improvements across all financial and 
operational performance measures. 
Whilst we have made a solid start to the 
year, the market remains competitive. 
With the business now stabilised and 
a strong balance sheet, we are well 
positioned to take advantage of market 
opportunities and continue to deliver 
sustainable profitable growth.
