POSITIONING 
FOR FUTURE 
GROWTH
Market overview
FY17 has been a year of delivery and positioning for  
future growth of Accrol, with the UK tissue market 
currently worth £2.2 billion at retail selling price. 
Although there has been a small decline, due to 
promotional activity, in the value of consumer sales 
through Multiples and Discounters, down 1.5% to £1.5 
billion, the Discount Sector continues to demonstrate 
the most significant growth at over 10% per annum. 
Brands continue to be slowly eroded with Own-Label 
within the Major Multiples reaching 47% of the total 
market by March 2017. Inflation, driven by a fall in the 
value of Sterling following the EU referendum, first 
appeared in the tissue category in early 2017 and is 
expected to accelerate as the year continues.
In anticipation of exchange rate volatility immediately 
ahead of, and following, the EU Referendum, Accrol 
entered into a significant number of forward contracts  
to hedge its currency exposure. This, along with 
favourable Parent Reel pricing dynamics, enabled Accrol 
to minimise the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility 
on its financial performance through FY17. As exchange 
rates continue to be weak in favour of the US Dollar, 
tissue manufacturers and convertors are facing rising raw 
material prices as pulp is traded in US Dollars on global 
markets. Accrol is well advanced in conversations with 
customers regarding inflation recovery but they are 
challenging and will take time to conclude.
Strategy
Throughout the year we have focused on our long-term 
strategy of increasing our share of the Discount Sector as 
increasing inflation encourages UK shoppers to search out 
quality and value and further accelerates the growth of the 
Discount Sector. Evidence of this can already be seen with 
Aldi and Lidl both recently reporting market share growth 
of almost 20%. Increasing product prices will also see 
further moves in sales from brands into Own-Label within 
the Major Multiples as they all seek to re-set their ranges 
and shopper offering. Our aim of gaining further Own-
Label business with the Major Multiples therefore remains  
a key strategic objective. 
Our sourcing strategy of purchasing Parent Reels globally 
from partner paper mills will continue to be a key point of 
difference. Leveraging strong commercial terms, flexibility 
on sourcing new technologies and better use of cash 
remain the key advantages of this sourcing strategy as 
opposed to a vertically-integrated model. There is still 
significant over capacity in the world pulp and tissue 
markets, as new paper mills come online, which appears 
set to continue through to 2019.
Contracts
We won a number of new contracts in FY17, the most 
significant being the launch of Lidl’s Floralys range in 
November 2016. The account has continued to trade 
above the original expected levels of circa £10 million 
per annum.
Relationships with key customers remain positive and 
our investment for future growth by increasing capacity 
and improving our supply chain has been well-received. 
Our relationship with Booker, Accrol’s largest customer, 
continues to be strong and we have recently signed a 
new supply agreement.
Conversations with the Major Multiples continued 
throughout the year and all outlined the need for an 
increase in Accrol’s manufacturing capacity in order  
to move major tranches of volume, underlying the 
importance of our continued investment in the business. 
Increased input costs driven by exchange rates have 
prompted inflation recovery conversations and, 
subsequently, more tender processes across the 
industry. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 7

Investment
Significant progress has been made on 
building a platform for future growth during 
the year. A suitable 168,000 sq ft site was 
quickly identified and secured at Leyland, 
Lancashire. From moving into the building  
in late October 2016, the premises were 
modified for manufacturing use with the 2 
converting lines installed from January 2017 
onwards. Commissioning on the first line 
was completed in April 2017 and on the 
second line in June 2017. Ramp up of 
volume has continued with the addition of 
new shift patterns and will continue into 
FY18. We recently announced the purchase 
of a further tissue conversion line which will 
take the total business capacity to 158,000 
tonnes for FY18 or circa £200 million per 
annum sales. The Leyland site has space for 
a further 3 conversion lines in addition to the 
3 lines that will be in place.
In addition to laying down new capacity,  
an investment programme commenced in 
the year on the existing Blackburn sites to 
improve operational efficiency, and hence 
overall capacity. This includes staff training 
and a new rotating shift pattern that is more 
employee friendly.
The final part of the investment for growth 
strategy in FY17 was the implementation of  
a Supply Chain Optimisation plan to improve 
and simplify warehousing and logistics, 
creating additional capacity for growth.  
A more efficient single ‘big shed’ solution 
was adopted and a site quickly identified  
on the M58 at Skelmersdale in Lancashire.  
This 368,000 sq ft warehouse is newly 
refurbished and will house finished goods 
and provide central distribution facilities to  
all UK customers. Warehouse management 
and national logistics will be contracted  
out to a 3rd-party provider, NFT, enabling  
the Accrol management team to focus  
on its core competencies of sourcing and 
manufacturing. 
People
Following our IPO in June 2016, a new PLC 
Board was put in place and a review of our 
organisational structure was undertaken. Key 
gaps were identified and have subsequently 
been filled with highly experienced industry 
experts. The new team helped transition  
the Hussain family out of the business by 
October 2016 as agreed in a collaborative 
and controlled manner.
People remain our most important asset  
and further investment continues to be 
made into their working environment 
through a focus on equipment and health 
and safety, into their welfare through more 
employee-friendly rotating shift patterns,  
and into respecting their views and opinions 
through employee engagement.
Market opportunities/outlook
The Directors believe that Accrol’s strategy 
remains relevant for the marketplace and that 
there continue to be opportunities for further 
growth. The move toward Discounters and 
Own-Label will be accelerated as shoppers 
try to reduce the inevitable impact of inflation 
without compromising on quality. Despite 
the exchange rate driven inflationary 
pressures and the slower than expected 
consumer price increases which the whole 
industry faces, the Directors remain confident 
that when price increases do come through, 
our sourcing policy and investment in 
capacity, supply chain efficiency and people 
has positioned Accrol to take advantage of 
the marketplace dynamics.
