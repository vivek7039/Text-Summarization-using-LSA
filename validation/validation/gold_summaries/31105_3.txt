BUILDING VALUE 
TOGETHER
I am delighted to introduce Sumo Group’s first Annual Report 
as a quoted company, which shows the material progress 
made by the business in 2017.
The year under review was a significant one. Having 
completed a secondary management buyout, backed by 
Perwyn LLP, in September 2016, the business entered 2017 
energised and with a clear plan to deliver strong organic and 
acquisitive growth. Not only were both these objectives met 
but the year culminated with the successful admission of 
shares in Sumo Group plc to AIM on 21 December 2017. 
The listing route was chosen to provide a new and ready 
source of capital with which to deleverage the balance sheet, 
raise the profile of the Company, enable the incentivisation 
of its people and allow the management to execute its 
growth strategy. Y ou will see from the rest of this Annual 
Report how those objectives have been achieved or are being 
advanced. I thank my Board colleagues and pay tribute to 
the wider management team for their dedication and hard 
work, throughout the year, which has allowed us to complete 
the highly time-consuming admission process while at the 
same time delivering an excellent operating performance.
Sumo Group plc’s flotation also enabled private equity 
investor, Perwyn, to realise some of its investment, 
while keeping a significant shareholding in the newly 
quoted business going forward. We are grateful for their 
ongoing support.
In preparation for IPO, we welcomed David Wilton as Chief 
Financial Officer and, upon admission, Michael Sherwin 
also joined the Board as Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director . Their profiles, which appear on page 20 and are 
available on www.sumogroupplc.com/about/board-of-
directors/, demonstrate the breadth of relevant experience 
they bring to the PLC Board.
2017 PROGRESS
Management team and Board strengthened.
Successful IPO: new structure to facilitate 
further growth.
Since IPO, the Board has begun a process 
to enable widescale employee participation 
in the Group’s shares.  Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
09
We completed the acquisition of Atomhawk 
Design Limited, a multi award winning visual 
design company, servicing the video games, 
film and visual effects industries, in June 2017, 
extending the range of premium services 
Sumo Group provides. Atomhawk had a 
very strong second half, out-performing our 
pre-acquisition expectations. Immediately 
after the year end, Sumo Group also took 
on the Newcastle studio of CCP Games, 
bringing a number of talented colleagues into 
the business and increasing our capacity to 
deliver high quality services to our clients.
As well as expanding and deepening client 
relationships throughout the year, Sumo Digital 
successfully launched its first own-IP game, 
Snake Pass, generating revenue of £1.7m in 
2017. On the back of this success, the Group 
intends to continue the selective development 
of independent games based on original IP .
One of the important functions of any board 
is governance. Y ou will see, in this, our first 
Annual Report, the structure and processes 
that have been put in place or extended by the 
Board, as part of the move to becoming a listed 
company. These will continue to develop over 
the coming year .
The source of our success is our people; 
we value them highly and are committed to 
providing a positive working environment. We 
have invested significantly in our premises in 
Sheffield and recently moved the Atomhawk 
Canada operations into a larger site in 
Vancouver . Since IPO, the Board has begun 
a process to enable widescale employee 
participation in the Group’s shares. 
In summary, we made great progress 
during 2017 and Sumo Group is well-
positioned to repeat this in 2018 and beyond. 
Our success is due to the skill and dedication 
of colleagues across the Group and, on behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank them all 
for their contribution.

ACQUISITION OF ATOMHAWK
In June 2017 Sumo Digital acquired 
Atomhawk, a multi-award winning 
visual design company servicing the 
entertainment industry. 
Founded in 2009 by Cumron Ashtiani, 
Atomhawk now has studios in Newcastle 
and Vancouver (Canada), employing 36 
people as at 31 March 2018. Key services 
include visual development (concept art), 
marketing art as well as motion graphics 
and user interface design. 
The business helps its clients to define 
the visual style of a product, delivering art 
and design throughout the development 
cycle and beyond, also creating marketing 
imagery, video content and packaging 
design. Atomhawk primarily serves 
the creative industries, working with 
video games studios, as well as film 
and television production companies. 
Atomhawk has been involved in the creation 
of many high profile projects, including 
movies Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor II 
and Avengers II, J.K. Rowling’s online 
experience, Pottermore, and games 
such as Mortal Kombat, Injustice, Game 
of Thrones: Conquest and Eve: Valkyrie. 
Atomhawk is a regular creative vendor for 
global brands such as Lego, Microsoft, 
Sony, Amazon and Warner Bros, with a 
client list incorporating a number of high 
profile video game developers, movie 
studios and product designers, including 
Marvel, Zynga, CCP Games, Ninja Theory, 
BBC, Ubisoft and Costa Coffee. 
The acquisition was funded through 
a mixture of cash and equity. Cumron 
continues to lead Atomhawk and has 
a shareholding in the Company.
