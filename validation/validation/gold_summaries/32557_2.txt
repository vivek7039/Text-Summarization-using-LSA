creating one of the UK’s leading food, general merchandise and

fast delivery networks. 
Sainsbury’s Bank offers accessible financial services products such 
as credit cards, insurance, travel money and personal loans that

Our 195,000 colleagues, strong culture and values are integral to

Food
Sainsbury’s has sold great quality food at 
fair prices since 1869. We have a strong

first retailer of organic produce 
in the UK. We continue to build our 
strength in food innovation, targeting 
growing food markets where we can 
increase our market share, such as

can be a market leader.

The new Sainsbury’s Group
02 Strategic Report The world is changing faster  
than at any time
Convenience, speed and flexibility are key  
in today’s retail environment. Our strategy 
is to sell products whenever and wherever 
customers want.
Our supermarkets offer customers a comprehensive mix of food, 
general merchandise and clothing. Our smaller convenience stores 
are located where our customers live and work, with a product mix 
designed for regular top-up shopping and to meet their day-to-
day needs. 
We have a well-established and growing online offer that allows 
customers to shop from the comfort of their home, or on the go via 
a mobile phone or tablet, opting for either convenient delivery to 
their home or to Click & Collect from our stores. 
Our acquisition of Home Retail Group plc has accelerated our 
strategy. Customers now have access to Argos products, market-
leading Argos digital channels and delivery systems. Argos’s 
unique Hub and Spoke supply chain network and Fast Track 
delivery and collection service are points of competitive advantage.
