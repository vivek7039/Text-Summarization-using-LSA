 Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OVERVIEW
Since the flotation of Blue Prism in March 2016 we have 
seen significant progress in the RPA market and in our 
business.
There have been advances in the size and visibility  
of the RPA market and it is clear that RPA as a 
technology offering is now high on the agenda for  
many organisations. The growing interest in the  
market for RPA from new and existing participants  
is testament to its increasing importance. 
Blue Prism is both driving and benefiting from this 
evolution of the market. In the period, we have seen  
a significant increase in sales, a substantial growth of our 
customer base and further strengthening of our market-
leading position whilst managing the cost  
base and cash flow with real discipline.
The executive management has successfully executed the 
strategy for growth set out at the time of the flotation. 
Our principal route to market is through  
our partner channel which is now highly engaged  
and growing in sophistication and global reach and  
has contributed enormously to our growth.
THE BOARD
The Board, which was formed just prior to flotation,  
is functioning well and interacting effectively with the 
executive management contributing a good balance of 
skills and experience. Gary Johnson, our Chief Financial 
Officer (“CFO”) at the time of flotation, has decided to 
step down from the Board. Gary has made a significant 
contribution over the past 3 years developing and 
strengthening the financial systems to support our 
expansion and growth. Ijoma Maluza has joined the 
Board as CFO and will continue to build on the strong 
platform established by Gary. 
While businesses experiencing rapid growth, such as 
Blue Prism, often face managerial challenges, the Board 
is fully engaged with the executive management team 
to ensure that the Group is positioned to address the 
growth challenge head-on. In particular, ensuring the 
ongoing recruitment of senior experienced staff with 
strong track records who can proactively engage in the 
challenge of building a world-class technology Company.
OUR PEOPLE
Without the energy, commitment and enthusiasm of the 
Blue Prism employees the rapid growth and financial 
performance of Blue Prism would not be possible. We 
thank them for another year of hard work and 
execution.
OUTLOOK
In the year ahead, we are focused on maintaining our 
growth momentum. The attractiveness of our market 
will inevitably encourage competition. However, we 
believe 2018 will be a year in which we extend and 
capitalise on the clear lead we have built in the 
enterprise market for RPA, positioning us to deliver 
another exciting year of growth.
