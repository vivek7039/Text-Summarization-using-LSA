 The Group has delivered continued 
progress in revenue, margin and cash 
performance in 2017 , reflecting the 
Group's performance management 
discipline focused on margin-
accretive revenue growth and cash 
conversion delivering strong returns 
for our shareholders. 
In line with our progressive dividend policy 
and underpinned by our excellent cash 
generative earnings model and strong 
balance sheet, we have announced a full 
year dividend of 71.3p, an increase of 
14.3% and are increasing the dividend 
payout ratio to circa 50% from 2018. 
The Products and Trade related divisions, 
which represent 94% of the Group's 
earnings, delivered excellent performance 
with organic revenue growth of 4.8% at 
constant rates while, as expected, trading 
conditions remained challenging in the 
Resources related division. 
Moving forward, the growth opportunities 
are highly attractive for Intertek as we 
further leverage our high-quality, 
cash-generative earnings model, built on 
the local expert delivery of Assurance, 
Testing, Inspection and Certification 
services on a global scale, that together 
define our unique Total Quality Assurance 
(TQA) value proposition. 
It remains important to contextualise our 
performance of 2017 and anticipated 
future earnings growth, driven by our 
differentiated growth strategy based on 
our TQA value proposition and the 
significant market development 
opportunities ahead, all underpinned by 
the exceptionally deep and broad 
expertise of our people.
 
SEIZING THE MARKET 
OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD
At Intertek, our aim is to give our clients 
across the world the uncompromised peace 
of mind that builds trust.
One thing is for certain – this is a 
differentiated approach with the 
commercial potential to step up our scale 
and performance as we move ahead. 
Intertek is facing a tremendous 
opportunity: a global opportunity that we 
currently value at around $250 billion.
This is the estimated total value of the 
global Quality Assurance market, of which 
only around 20 per cent is currently 
outsourced. That means that companies 
across the world manage approximately 
$200 billion-worth of quality assurance 
for themselves – the massive hidden 
‘iceberg’ of potential.
Additionally, in our view, there is significant 
untapped opportunity beyond the $250 
billion, as companies increasingly become 
aware of systemic risk in their businesses 
and the need for T otal Quality Assurance. 
In 2017 , we made progress on performance and 
strategy... the organic and inorganic growth 
opportunities ahead are truly exciting!

LEVERAGING OUR UNIQUE 
TQA VALUE PROPOSITION
Intertek pioneers the Quality Assurance 
industry on a global scale with a fully 
integrated portfolio of Assurance, 
Testing, Inspection and Certification (ATIC) 
services. This is what we call Total Quality 
Assurance and is what clients increasingly 
want and need in a progressively 
complex world. 
Intertek is the only company to have 
added the Assurance dimension to the 
‘TIC’ components to offer an integrated 
ATIC value proposition to its clients.
So what drove us to take this step? We 
took the simple decision to look at our 
value proposition from the customer’s 
perspective. And this rapidly revealed to 
us that TQA is what our customers now 
require, almost regardless of their size, 
their industry or their location. 
This is for a very simple reason. In the 
past, companies were primarily focused on 
the quality control issues around their 
end-products, raw materials, components 
and assets – all of which rely on the 
efficiency and effectiveness of Testing, 
Inspection and Certification activities. 
Importantly, the demand for TIC 
components will continue to grow in the 
years to come, benefiting from a number of 
André Lacroix
Chief Executive Officer
parallel trends: companies’ investments in 
quality and innovation, for example, as well 
as ever-strengthening regulatory 
standards, increased focus on sustainability, 
accelerating global and regional trade flows, 
and increasing demand for energy.
Another powerful trend is also at play, 
however. In our global market place, 
corporations are sharpening their focus on 
the management of risk in their 
increasingly complex supply chain and 
distribution operations. This is where 
Assurance comes in – and it is why we 
have evolved beyond quality control alone 
to additionally assure the reliability of 
clients’ operating processes and quality 
management systems. 
BUILDING OUR VALUE PROPOSITION
It was this recognition that led us to 
substantially adapt the Intertek value 
proposition around a new Customer 
Promise. This Promise commits us to 
“Intertek Total Quality Assurance 
expertise, delivered consistently with 
precision, pace and passion, enabling our 
customers to power ahead safely”.
Now we can support the existing and 
emerging TQA needs of our customers 
in all areas of their extended 
operations, from R&D, sourcing 
materials and component suppliers to 
transportation, distribution, retail and 
consumer management. 
This gives our clients the systemic TQA 
solution they want and we believe TQA is 
set to be an increasingly important 
requirement in the future, as the trading 
landscape in which our customers operate 
continues to become more complex and 
global. And it is already complex – today, 
almost 60 per cent of GDP is international. 
THE ATIC ADVANTAGE
Our global TQA Experts give 
our clients the ATIC 
Advantage by delivering our 
TQA Customer Promise."

on page 10 
Compare this with 50 years ago, when 
global trade represented only 25 per cent 
of global GDP.
This burgeoning globalism is driving 
change in the ways that supply chains 
are formulated. It is giving corporations 
the opportunity to focus squarely on their 
core competencies and take advantage 
of new, decentralised sourcing and 
manufacturing opportunities that are 
driving down their costs.

However, there is a price to pay – the price 
of additional complexity in the supply 
chain, particularly around the ongoing and 
accelerating shift to multi-tier sourcing. 
This is not the only driver of complexity. 
Consumers, too, are becoming more 
demanding and selective as they seek 
greater variety, more sustainable and 
ethically sourced products, better customer 
service, faster delivery, heightened quality 
and enhanced value. This in turn has 
increased competition, giving rise to 
increasing numbers of products and brand 
choices as well as more trade channels and 
routes to market. As a result, the distribution 
chain too is becoming ever-more complex.
This additional complexity in both the 
supply and the distribution chains is 
heightening the risk of failure at any 
number of points, and therefore increasing 
the value for organisations of having 
granular insight into the risks they face.
Our internal data is telling us that the role 
of Assurance is increasing significantly. 
Moreover, the success that we are deriving 
from the move into Assurance is providing 
hard evidence that TQA is what customers 
want and need. 
OUR DIFFERENTIATED 5X5 STRATEGY 
FOR GROWTH
The lead, already two years in the making, is 
delivering a commercial advantage for 
Intertek with our TQA Customer Promise 
lying at the heart of our 5x5 differentiated 
strategy for growth.
Our 5x5 strategy has one overriding 
objective – to move the Intertek centre 
of gravity towards those sectors of our 
addressable market that will in years to 
come deliver both the highest rates of 
growth and the best available margins. 
Achieving this aim will accelerate our 
growth and help us maximise our share 
of that $250 billion ‘iceberg’ in the fastest 
and most efficient way possible.
It is by achieving our five medium-to-long-
term corporate goals that we believe we 
will measure progress and achieve against 
this strategy. 
As we are ultimately a people business 
whose success depends on the 
knowledge, expertise and commitment of 
our workforce, the first two goals are 
about our people and our clients.

• To deliver margin-accretive organic 
revenue, based on GDP+ organic growth
• To achieve strong cash conversion from 
our operations
Finally, given our highly cash-generative 
business model and broad-based

CEO'S REVIEW
continued A CUSTOMER-CENTRIC 
ORGANISATION
Intertek is uniquely positioned to deliver 
ATIC solutions with a truly global network: 
over 1,000 laboratories and offices in 
more than 100 countries across the 
world, providing fast and efficient services 
to customers on a local basis. This is the 
primary focus of our more than 43,000 
employees. In order to ensure we are 
focused on the needs of our clients at 
the point of delivery, we operate a 
decentralised business model. 
The real strength of Intertek is in its 
people, its global team of experts. Indeed, 
it is both humbling and enormously 
exciting to recognise through every 
interaction with them, that our people 
have the most remarkable expertise, 
entrepreneurial capabilities and talent 
for innovation. 
Our people give us the foundations we 
need to support our Customer Promise 
that sits at the heart of our value 
proposition. In short, it is our people who 
consistently set us apart from our 
competition – and they do so by 
demonstrating five powerful 
differentiating attributes:
•  The consistent quality and precision of 
their findings, conclusions and reports
• Their speed of response, delivering the 
rapid, detailed and accurate feedback 
that clients demand
• The ability to manage properly 
customer-centric relationships (summed 
up best by one employee who recently 
said to me “the customer is the centre 
of our universe”)
•  Deep expertise in their subject areas 
and incisive understanding of customer 
requirements
• A proven track record of innovating 
and anticipating the changing needs 
of our clients. 
It’s in such ways that we aim always to 
live up to the standards set by our 
founding forefathers. These most 
famously include Thomas Edison, the 
giant of innovation who is not only 
credited with inventing the first practical 
incandescent lightbulb, the phonograph 
and the movie camera, but who also 
created the forerunner of today's 
Electrical Testing Laboratories that 
continue to provide Assurance to 
consumers through product performance 
and safety testing. Indeed, when 
manufacturers apply Intertek’s ETL Listed 
Mark to their products, the letters “ETL ” 
carry with them a long history of 
innovation, influence, and independence.
A PIONEERING CULTURE
That spirit of innovation continues today 
as Intertek people continue to drive the 
global development of the Quality 
Assurance industry. And it’s not just about 
the innovative capabilities of our people 
already within the organisation. While our 
primary focus is on organic growth, we are 
constantly seeking the right acquisition 
targets that genuinely complement and 
add to our existing expertise.
During 2016, for example, we made 
several strategically important acquisitions 
and investments. These included ABC 
Analitic, market leader in the provision of 
environmental water testing and analytical 
services in Mexico, and EWA-Canada, a 
world-leading cyber security business 
providing security assurance services for 
products, equipment and networks across 
multiple industries.
In April 2017 , we expanded our global 
profile in automotive testing with the 
acquisition of KJ Tech, a leading provider of 
vehicle, component, lubrication and fuel 
testing services based in Germany. 
And in December 2017 , with increasing 
demand for security Assurance services 
resulting from the rapid growth in 
connected devices (Internet of Things or 
'IoT'), the increase in data security 
breaches, and an increasingly diverse 
range of global certification standards and 
security requirements, we further 
strengthened our global footprint in cyber 
security Certification and Assurance with 
the acquisition of Acumen Security, 
headquartered in Maryland, USA. 
These acquired businesses are 
established, recognised and highly 
regarded, and will continue to operate 
under their own brands within the Intertek 
family, while bringing us access to 
additional areas of expertise that we can 
take to new countries and customers. 
OUR DEPTH AND BREADTH OF 
TQA EXPERTISE
Customers understand the depth of 
expertise that our people have; our 
opportunity is to leverage the breadth of 
what we have to offer. Again, it is 
humbling to appreciate the sheer scope of 
our people’s expertise in a range of areas 
that covers just about the full range of 
business activities undertaken anywhere 
on the planet. 
The best way of explaining that breadth is 
to describe in some detail how our services 
can be applied to the sourcing, production 
and distribution of a simple product – such 
as a T -shirt, for example.

 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 17
STRATEGIC REPORT We offer our clients the 
ATIC Advantage, our global 
TIC expertise combined with 
our Assurance Difference.
INTERTEK TIC EXPERTISE
This starts well before manufacturing 
actually begins, with testing of the physical 
and chemical safety of the materials 
involved. For example, we can test against 
the GOTS (Global Organic T extile Standard) 
on organic cotton. The further T esting, 
Inspection and Certification processes that 
we can apply include:
  H ig h - V o lu m e I ns t r u m e n t 
Testing: here, we test factors 
including the air-permeability, 
length, strength and colour of the 
cotton fibres prior to shipment
 Raw Materials & Pre-Production 
Inspection: we help to eliminate 
any manufacturing variances at later 
stages in the process by inspecting 
the quality and quantity of raw 
materials before production begins
 Product Testing for Physical and 
Chemical Safety: at this stage, we 
test for a range of the product’s 
physical and chemical safety 
attributes, including factors such as 
flammability and the presence of any 
sharp edges in the finished garment
 Final Random Inspection: we 
carry out a detailed inspection of 
finished goods before they proceed 
to shipment
 Certificate of Conformity: this is 
the point at which we certify that 
goods comply with the importing 
country’s specific health, safety and 
environmental standards
 Retail Store Building Testing: we 
provide a wide range of Building and 
Construction services
 Commercial and Functional 
Claims: we carry out tests on final 
products to ensure that they 
achieve the standards claimed in 
promotional materials; these can 
include factors like ‘quick-dry’, 
colour-fastness, thermal resistance 
and waterproofing.
T esting, Inspection and Certification is 
required to control quality and safety at the 
high-risk, regulated points of the supply 
chain and the urgent desire of our people to 
develop new solutions throughout is a key 
differentiator for Intertek: it is in our culture 
that we should, whenever necessary or 
desirable, develop effective and original 
solutions to emerging issues.
OUR ASSURANCE DIFFERENCE
The Intertek difference comes when we 
complement the physical T esting, Inspection 
and Certification at the critical points with 
end-to-end, truly systemic Assurance 
processes. We achieve this through expert, 
in-depth audits and assessments of all the 
systems and operating processes that are 
involved. These take place in enormous 
numbers – during 2017 , our 3,000 
professional auditors carried out more than 
100,000 audits across the world, 
positioning us as significantly the number 
one compliance auditor globally.
Not only is our growing ability to provide 
fully bespoke Assurance solutions an 
important competitive advantage – it is also 
highly attractive from an earnings-model 
position, as it is capital-light and delivers 
margins that are greater than the average 
across our Group. 
Once again, this approach extends far 
beyond our customers' own premises. 
Staying with the T -shirt example, we carry 
out onsite audits and training to ensure the 
correct usage and treatment of chemicals 
throughout the entire length of the supply 
chain. Other Assurance services include:
 D a m ag e S u r v e y i ng : we can 
inspect cotton for any damage that 
might have been sustained during 
transit
 Mill Qualification Programme: 
under this key service, we can 
evaluate a manufacturing supplier’s 
quality, environmental and social 
performance, and certify the mill’s 
own in-house lab. This is a 
particularly important aspect of 
the quality assurance process, as 
it provides peace of mind that 
suppliers are abiding by international 
standards and legislation on 
modern-day slavery and child labour
 E n v ir o n m e nt a l Ch e mi c a l 
Management Solutions: we 
ensure proper chemical management 
by undertaking thorough testing of 
wastewater and sludge as well as 
onsite auditing and training
 Ethical Supply Chain 
Assessments: we can certify 
garment factories against a wide 
range of international standards, 
including Worldwide Responsible 
Accredited Production (WRAP), 
SA8000 (a leading social 
accountability certification 
standard) and our own widely 
recognised Workplace Conditions 
Assessment (WCA) standard
 S u p p l ie r Q u al i fi c at io n 
Programme: this is a wide-ranging 
programme that supports a 
coherent and truly world-class 
standard enabling corporations to 
drive continuous improvement in 
their benchmarking. This covers 
areas ranging from product and 
process quality to site 
management and training
 Custom and Trade Partnership 
against Terrorism: we help 
importing businesses set up policies 
that improve not only their own 
security practices but those of their 
supply chain partners too
 C o u n t e r fe i t i ng A s s u r a n c e : 
integrating our Intellectual Property 
(IP) expertise into our family of 
Assurance services enables us to 
determine whether partners in the 
supply chain pose a risk of 
counterfeiting our customers' 
products
 B e n c hm ar ki n g : by comparing the 
features and quality of our customers' 
products to industry norms, we can 
enable informed decision-making on 
factors such as performance claims, 
design and pricing
 Cyber Security Assurance: our 
cutting edge cyber security 
solutions, strengthened by our 
acquisition of EWA-Canada, provide 
protection against ransomware, 
increasingly sophisticated phishing 
scams, distributed denial-of-service 
attacks and more
 L i f e c y c l e A ss e ss me n t s : we use 
cloud-based technology to deliver a 
sustainability Assurance solution that 
enables customers to compute the 
carbon footprint of their products, 
processes and business operations.

 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 18
STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW
THE T-SHIRT JOURNEY AN INDUSTRY-AGNOSTIC TQA 
APPROACH
Here, we have only looked at one specific 
area of the global apparel industry. But 
while our service portfolio includes services 
that are specific to individual industries and 
sectors, Intertek’s reach is industry-
agnostic. We apply our TQA approach to all 
of the industries with which we work.
We can demonstrate this by taking 
another example – a highly appropriate 
one given our historical connections to 
Thomas Edison. This time, we look at how 
we provide a TQA solution in support of 
the global manufacturing and distribution 
of a LED lightbulb, as shown on page 12. 
Once again, our TIC services are wide-
ranging; they embrace physical testing and 
chemical analysis at the copper mine, 
T esting and Inspection during 
manufacturing, packaging Certification for 
the distributor, battery T esting at the 
hauliers, and market surveillance Inspection 
and claims T esting for the retailer.
But this is only half the story. A product 
with a global market is naturally subject to 
a wide range of complex risks, which is 
why we complement these TIC services 
with our global market Assurance service. 
This is part of our comprehensive 
Assurance portfolio that helps our 
customers identify and mitigate the risks 
that are intrinsic to their operations, 
supply chain and distributed quality 
management operations.
So, at the mine, physical testing and 
chemical analysis can be underpinned by a 
Damage Survey, for example. In production, 
energy efficiency T esting and global safety 
Certification might be complemented with 
global market and packaging evaluation 
Assurance services. And even at the retail 
end, a market surveillance initiative 
inspecting product quality might coincide 
with Assurance services like benchmarking 
and returns analysis.
The emerging picture is complex enough 
when we consider relatively simple 
products like a T-shirt or LED lightbulb. But 
we are every bit as capable of delivering 
an end-to-end, integrated TQA service in 
greatly more complex industries, including 
automotive manufacturing. 
To take a live example, we provide one 
manufacturer with a wide range of TIC 
services at every stage of the value chain, 
from R&D and raw materials, through 
manufacturing and production processes 
to import and export, the dealership 
network, customer experience 
considerations and into the aftermarket.
Once again, we support the manufacturer 
at all the same stages with a bespoke 
range of Assurance services, from 
regulatory compliance assessments and 
design validation planning at the R&D 
stage, through Greenhouse Gas Validation 
and Verification Failure Analysis during 
manufacturing and ultimately to Field 
Performance Data Collection Analysis. We 
clearly demonstrate our flexibility when it 
comes to factors like emissions and fuel 
consumption – for this sort of Assurance 
work does not take place in the 
laboratory, but out on the road in 
ordinary driving conditions.
Our industry-agnostic TQA approach 
provides our clients with global TIC 
expertise and an Assurance Difference: 
the ATIC Advantage delivered by Intertek 
TQA Experts.
OUR GLOBAL TQA EXPERTS
The key to our continuing sales growth is 
our responsive culture, decentralised 
organisation and global network of 
state-of-the-art laboratories – and above all 
the depth and breadth of our people’s 
expertise: global TQA subject-matter 
experts, who know how to innovate and 
solve challenges that nobody has previously 
been able to overcome.
These are some of the Intertek strengths 
that enable us to live and fulfil our Core 
Purpose of 'Bringing Quality and Safety to 
Life'. But they would not be so effective 
without a clearly defined organisational 
structure based around an operating 
model that always puts the customer 
first. We maximise the potential returns 
accrued from this infrastructure through 
multiple further factors, including:
• A disciplined and systemic approach to 
financial performance management
• Our highly cash-generative earnings 
model
• Our capital-light business model, which 
enables us to respond and adapt rapidly 
to the changing needs of our customers 
and markets
• Our disciplined approach to capital 
allocation, which enables us to support 
organic growth through creating new 
services, developing client relationships 
in high-margin areas and investing in the 
most attractive growth opportunities.
LOOKING AHEAD
We believe that the strength of our 2017 
results demonstrates the attractive 
nature of our industry, Intertek's high-
quality earnings model and the 
effectiveness of our 5x5 differentiated 
strategy for growth. We are confident 
about the structural growth prospects in 
the global Quality Assurance market.
We are uniquely positioned to seize these 
attractive growth opportunities, 
underpinned by the increased 
complexities of corporate supply and 
distribution chains and the associated 
challenges of maintaining a high level of 
quality assurance end-to-end.
Leveraging our industry-leading expertise 
and innovative and entrepreneurial culture, 
we service a diversity of industries, 
geographies and customers, with our 
global network enabling us to follow the 
supply chains of our customers wherever 
they are in the world.
We have a strong track record of creating 
sustainable growth and shareholder value, 
leveraging our high-margin and highly 
cash-generative earnings model.
We are moving the Company's centre of 
gravity towards our industry's most 
attractive growth and margin areas with 
a disciplined approach to performance 
management and capital allocation.
We are on track on our 'good to great' 
journey, making progress on both 
performance and strategy.
I am certain that the passion and expertise 
of our people will continue to be the primary 
differentiator that makes Intertek a true 
pioneer in the global Quality Assurance 
market. In short, I am very excited about 
what the future holds for Intertek, its 
employees, shareholders and customers. 
Above all our TQA Customer Promise of 
Total Quality. Assured is providing our 
clients with the peace of mind they need 
to grow their business.
