Directors’ report
Remuneration – unaudited
Annual statement by the 
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee (“RemCo”)
For the year ended 31 August 2017 
(not subject to audit)
Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 August 2017. It should 
be noted that as an Isle of Man company, 
Redefine International is voluntarily reporting 
under the UK regulations in order to provide 
transparency to our shareholders. 
2017 Policy: New Executive 
Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders on 23 January 2017
At the start of the financial year, the RemCo 
concluded that the executive remuneration 
package, but particularly the outcome of the 
LTIP, did not correctly reflect the executives’ 
performance nor did it align with shareholder 
returns achieved over the same period. 
A strategic review of the remuneration policy 
was therefore undertaken. 
A new remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors was recommended and approved by 
79.91 per cent of shareholders at the AGM on 
23 January 2017 (the “New Policy”) and applied 
to all remuneration components awarded 
after that date. The New Policy will remain 
in place for the next three years unless any 
material changes are proposed. No changes 
have been proposed to the executive 
remuneration policy this year.
A summary of the New Policy can be found 
on pages 84 to 85. 
Remuneration for the 
2017 financial year
2017 Performance: the table overleaf shows 
how the executives have implemented the 
strategic priorities as detailed on pages 14 and 
15 of this Annual Report, and how their 
actions reflect on the bonus targets.
2017 Salary: awarded 1 September 2016.
The average salary increase for employees  
for 2017 was 6.3 per cent. A 15 per cent salary 
increase was awarded to the Deputy CEO to 
bring his salary closer to that of the CEO and 
to recognise his increased responsibilities 
within the executive team. All other executives 
received a 5 per cent increase which, although 
above inflation, still resulted in their salaries 
being in the lower quartile of our peer group.
2017 Bonus: awarded for the performance 
period 1 September 2016 – 31 August 2017.
Due to redressing the balance between long 
and short term compensation, the maximum 
executive bonus has increased from 
100 per cent to 150 per cent of base salary. 
Having exceeded the targets set for cash flow, 
NAV and achieving the target for earnings, the 
executives have been awarded a cash bonus 
of 121.9 per cent of base salary. Of the award, 
60 per cent will be settled in cash immediately 
with 40 per cent deferred for two years, 
subject to continuous employment in the 
Group, and to be settled in shares. The bonus 
award is in line with in the lower quartile of 
the FTSE 250, where the Company is currently 
positioned. 
2017 LTIP vesting: for the three year 
performance period ended 31 August 2017.
The performance period for the award related 
to the three years ending 31 August 2017 and 
was subject to the historic TSR performance 
conditions. The outcome of the LTIP award 
has again resulted in nil vesting. 
2017 LTIP Contingent award: awarded 
for the three year performance period from 
1 September 2016 to 31 August 2019.
Contingent awards, equivalent to 200 per cent 
of salary, were made to each of the executives 
on 25 January 2017. These will be subject to the 
performance criteria set out in the New Policy 
approved at the 2017 AGM and will, subject to 
performance, vest on 25 January 2020. 
2017 Single figure remuneration: the 
total remuneration package received for 
the 2017 resulted in the executives’ total 
salaries remaining in the lower quartile of the 
FTSE 250. On average, the executives received 
56 per cent of target remuneration outlined in 
the implementation scenario within the 2014 
Annual Report.
2017 Non‑ executive Director fees
On 1 September 2016, Non-executive 
Directors received a fee increase of £3,000 
and the Chairman received an increase in 
fee of £6,500. These awards were made in 
recognition of increased responsibilities 
following the completion of AUK transaction, 
and the substantial augmentation of the 
Company. This resulted in the standard  
Non-executive Director fee being £43,000, 
although the Audit and Risk Committee chair 
was paid £50,500 and the Remuneration 
Committee chair was paid £48,000 to 
recognise their additional time commitments. 
Following the review of the remuneration 
policy by the RemCo and the work undertaken 
by the Investment Committee for the AUK 
transaction, the Board wished to acknowledge 
the increase in responsibilities, significant 
time commitment shared by all the committee 
chairs and resolved that the fees of all 
committee chairs be brought in line. From 
1 December 2016, all committee chairs have 
been paid £50,500.
Although these increases were above market 
norm, the fees for the Non-executive Directors 
and chairs remained in the lower quartile of 
the FTSE 250.

strategy

Higher earnings
45% 50%
(budget met)
• Capital was recycled into assets with stronger potential growth or used to lower 
the level of gearing and associated finance costs, which has strengthened the 
balance sheet and capital structure. 
• Newer assets have delivered significant value. The AUK assets have seen 
6.2% valuation growth and 7.2% growth in triple net income since their 
acquisition in 2016.
• Asset management activities targeting our best performing assets. 
Demonstrated through the potential development of Charing Cross Road, 
London and extensions at Banbury Cross Retail Park and Holiday Inn 
Express Southwark.
Growth in NAV
45% 100%
(120% of budget 
achieved)
• Disposals totalled £148.2 million during the year, at an average 12.2% premium 
to book value. Properties sold tended to demonstrate weak longer term growth 
potential, thus strengthening the underlying property fundamentals of the 
portfolio. 
• Active recycling of capital into assets demonstrating stronger property 
fundamentals.
• Focusing on assets in geographical locations with the best growth potential. 
Demonstrated with the IHL acquisition where properties are located in the 
South East of England or big six UK centres.
Stronger operating 
cash flow
22.5% 100%
(120% of budget 
achieved)
• Re-financing activity has seen the average cost of debt reduced to 3.1% (from 
3.4% in 2016, resulting in a significant finance cost saving).
• Internal cost of capital reduced with stronger dividend cover and headroom on 
operational cash flow.
• Maintained headroom over operational cash flow to invest in asset management 
initiatives to grow value.
• More flexible capital structure has allowed the Group to apply available cash 
reserves against revolving credit facility to achieve lower ratcheted margin 
throughout the year.
• Extended debt maturity profile following refinancing initiatives removing 
refinancing risk with no significant maturities until 2020.
Personal objectives
37.5% 85%
(at RemCo’s 
discretion)
• Leadership: at the Capital Markets Day held in February 2017, the Company 
outlined clear and measurable medium term targets and the executives have 
demonstrated conviction in executing and delivering on all targets throughout 
the year.
• Communication with shareholders:
• extensive UK and South African road shows and to meet, explain and listen 
to major shareholder views;
• positive investor and analyst feedback following simplification of strategic 
objectives, clear communication, and no surprises in full results; and
• active engagement with investment market as demonstrated by the quantum 
of capital recycling completed and premiums to book values achieved.
• Communication with stakeholders: CSR initiatives undertaken to engage with 
communities and tenants, GRESB improvement and all suppliers required to 
abide by our code of ethics.
• Loyalty of staff: a desirable working culture and environment has been 
developed, demonstrated by a low staff turnover and a positive employee 
survey outcome.

Statement of implementation 
of remuneration for the 
2018 financial year
Set out below is a summary of the planned 
implementation of the remuneration policy 
for the financial year ending 31 August 2018.
2018 Salary: awarded 1 September 2017.
   2017 2018
Mike Watters  £391,000 £406,600
Stephen Oakenfull  £278,100 £289,200
Adrian Horsburgh  £253,100 £263,200
Donald Grant   £235,200 £244,600
Average salary increases of 4.6 per cent 
have been awarded to employees for 
2018, which was arrived at using a base 
inflationary adjustment of +2.5 per cent with 
additional increases awarded to recognise 
extra responsibilities, progress made in 
professional exams and changes in roles. 
Taking this into account, and a review 
of relevant market data, the executives were 
all awarded a 4 per cent increase. 
2018 Pension and benefits: Company 
pension contribution remains at 12.5 per cent 
of salary for the CEO and 9 per cent of salary 
for other Executive Directors. Other benefits 
comprise life assurance, private medical 
insurance, car allowance (CEO only), incapacity 
benefit, season ticket allowance and Directors’ 
and officer’s insurance.
2018 Annual bonus: to be awarded for 
the performance period 1 September 2017 – 
31 August 2018.
Executive Directors can be awarded a bonus 
of up to 150 per cent of salary. This is based 
on underlying distributable earnings (45 per 
cent), adjusted NAV growth (45 per cent), 
operating cash flow performance (22.5 per 
cent) and personal objectives (37.5 per cent). 
40 per cent of any award made will be subject 
to a two year deferral period, to be settled 
in shares. The targets for financial measures 
are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 
However, retrospective disclosure of the 
targets and performance against them will be 
provided in future remuneration reports.
2018 LTIP vesting: relating to the three year 
performance period ending 31 August 2018.
The awards made on 28 October 2015, for 
the performance period 1 September 2015 to 
31 August 2018, will vest on 28 October 2018. 
These awards are the last awards subject 
to the old policy performance conditions, 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM. 
This required the attainment of certain targets, 
each weighted at 50 per cent, relating to the 
performance of the Company’s TSR against 
the TSR of two comparator groups namely, 
(i) a bespoke peer group TSR and (ii) the FTSE 
EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index.
2018 Contingent LTIP Award: to be awarded 
for the three year performance period ending 
31 August 2020.
Executive Directors will receive an LTIP 
award over shares worth 200 per cent of 
salary, with the relevant performance targets 
being based on underlying distributable 
earnings per share (50 per cent), relative 
TSR (25 per cent) and relative total property 
return (25 per cent) all measured over a 
three year performance period. These 
measures are intended to align the awards 
with the Company’s strategic objectives and 
with shareholder interests. In particular: (a) 
the EPS measure is designed to incentivise 
distribution growth to shareholders; (b) the 
relative TSR measure (retained from the 
previous policy but with a reduced weighting) 
measures the total shareholder return of the 
Company against an appropriate index, and 
provides a direct link between shareholder 
returns and compensation; and (c) the relative 
total property return measure is designed 
to incentivise the enhancement of portfolio 
quality and distribution growth. Targets for 
these measures are set out on page 89.
Non‑ executive Director remuneration
The table below shows the fee structure for 
Non-executive Directors for 2018. 
   2017 fees 2018 fees
Chairman of the Board  £94,500 £98,000
Audit and Risk Committee  
chair fee   £50,500 £52,000
Remuneration Committee  
chair fee   £50,500 £52,000
Investment Committee  
chair fee   £50,500 £52,000
Basic non-executive fee £43,000 £45,000
It is acknowledged that Non-executive Director 
fees remain below market average. Increases 
take effect from 1 September 2017. Aggregate 
fees for seven Non-executive Directors 
amounts to £389,000. 
The Nominations Committee has reported 
on its search for a new independent  
Non-executive Director. It is hoped that an 
appointment will be made before the end of 
the year, which will result in aggregate fees for 
the Non-executive Directors totalling £434,000 
p.a. This exceeds the current £420,000 
aggregate limit set out in the Articles of 
Association and therefore a resolution will be 
proposed at the AGM on 25 January 2018 to 
amend the limit of fees to £500,000 p.a. 
Annual General Meeting
The full remuneration report for the financial 
year ended 31 August 2017 can be found on 
pages 86 to 91. 
The RemCo recommends the remuneration 
report to shareholders and hopes that 
shareholders will support the resolution 
at the AGM on 25 January 2018.
