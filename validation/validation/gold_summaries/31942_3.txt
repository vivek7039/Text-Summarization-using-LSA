Chairman’s statement 
 
The Group has made further significant progress over the last year in positioning each of the two core 
businesses for future success. Revenue from continuing operations was steady compared with the prior 
year, and the net loss for the year came in line with the Board’s expectations.  
Financial results and condition  
Revenues for the current year amounted to £2.00m, compared with £2.08m in the prior year (stated before 
the IntelliSAW related license fee of £3.04m). Administrative expenses increased to £3.32m from £2.54m 
in the prior year. This increase in expenditure reflects new product support and the commercial and 
marketing activity within Translogik to launch iTrack II and deliver effective pre-contract engagement with 
a number of key customers for this system.   
The pre tax loss from continuing operations for the year was £2.16m compared with a profit of £1.59m 
and loss in the prior year adjusted for the effects of the net IntelliSAW licence fee of £1.17m.  The total 
loss attributable to shareholders was £2.17m (2016: profit of £1.15m) resulting in a net loss per ordinary 
share of 22.84 pence (2016: earnings of 12.90 pence). The Board do not recommend payment of a 
dividend (2016: Nil). 
Net cash balances at 30 June 2017 were £2.52m (2016: £3.65m).  
Strategy 
The Group provides innovative sensor systems for various complex applications and operates two 
principal businesses, SAWSense and Translogik. 
The Group intends to continue to commercialise sensor technologies by working closely with global 
partners in order to build value for shareholders through the generation and distribution of net income, 
and/or the return of capital on realisation. 
SAWSense designs and develops Surface Acoustic Wave (or “SAW”) sensor devices that can be used to 
measure torque, pressure and/or temperature in harsh, restricted or demanding environments to very high 
accuracy. This world leading technology has a broad range of potential uses ranging from premium value 
custom applications through to high volume mass markets. 
Translogik designs and markets a range of Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems (“TPMS”), products and 
services for heavy duty off road vehicles (particularly mine-haul trucks), commercial truck and bus as well 
as passenger cars. These comprise the iTrack system, which provides real-time tyre temperature and 
pressure measurements for mine-haul trucks in service, and a range of tyre probes and other offerings for 
the road transport sector.  
The Translogik product offerings are continually evolving with the focus on providing a comprehensive 
service to clients in the mining and truck industry and this strategy has resulted in the successful launch 
of the iTrack II system in September 2016. 
Our markets 
SAW sensing in global industries 
 
Sensor technology is widely used in virtually every industrial application across a broad range of industries, 
contributing to many billions of dollars in revenue. Sensors using SAW technology are powered by radio 
frequency and do not require a battery and are wireless. This means that the sensor has significant 
benefits, as the package can be extremely small and light and is suited to harsh environments or remote 
locations, and does not require regular maintenance. Being wireless enables the sensor to be used in 
rotating components, other moving parts, or environments where electrical wiring would pose a safety 
risk. 
These benefits are particularly appropriate in drives, motors, gearboxes, valves and couplings, which are 
in common use in the industrial equipment, energy generation, oil & gas, aviation, military and automotive 
sectors.  Transense Technologies plc

Chairman’s statement (continued) 
As Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) seek ever more data on a real-time basis to optimise the 
performance of their products, accurate and frequent measurement becomes increasingly important. The 
world’s largest and most successful companies in these fields are recognising SAW as one of the enabling 
technologies in developing the “Internet of Things” in this arena, contributing to a vision by which machines 
are networked with embedded sensors to optimise performance using real time analytical tools, algorithms 
and interactive controls. 
TPMS in Mining 
 
The original iTrack system was developed to provide tyre pressure and temperature monitoring data to 
mine haul-truck operators, primarily to reduce or eliminate the incidence of tyre failure. The associated 
benefits in tyre life management were evident, and were initially viewed as a means of payback for the 
improved safety performance achieved. 
Over recent years the collection of pressure and temperature data has become increasingly sophisticated, 
and our systems for measuring, monitoring and reporting tyre conditions are seen by key customers as a 
management tool to optimise asset utilisation and productivity, whilst continuing to make a key contribution 
to mine safety. 
This work culminated in the September 2016 launch of the iTrack II system. iTrack II collects live tyre 
performance data from sensors, and transmits this instantly to an optional in-cab display, and to web 
based applications readable in real time by the Translogik Global Control Centre, and by individual mine 
operators in their own operational control rooms.  This valuable data can be utilised to minimise truck 
down time, extend tyre life, and improve safety. Crucially, it can also be used to increase mine productivity 
by identifying opportunities to optimise routings, loadings, and even road architecture. 
During earlier stages of commercialisation, we were met with resistance to financing the outright purchase 
of equipment by mine operators under severely constrained capital budgets during what has been a 
cyclically challenging few years for the industry. Accordingly, we are now offering implementation of iTrack 
II on an operating lease financing model, which enables users to generate additional revenues and save 
costs, against which they are able to meet the ongoing operating costs associated with using the system 
at a net gain.  
During the launch and market engagement phase, we have focused most of our attention on our more 
developed markets in Chile, Australia and Southern Africa, in which we have highly effective teams and 
channel partners. We have also begun to increase resources in additional territories such as the US, 
Canada and other countries in the Latin America region during the year.  Results have been very 
encouraging, with several mine operators running successful trials and choosing to adopt iTrack II toward 
the end of the financial year. The gestation period for widespread adoption, and the lead time to translate 
positive trial outcomes and orders into revenue, have been slower than we originally may have hoped, 
however we are confident that there are encouraging signs of commercial traction with a number of major 
global mining companies.  
Tyre pressure probes 
Our tyre tread depth probes offer a fast and reliable way for mining and on the road truck service providers 
as well as passenger car tyre fitters to record and automatically transmit tread depth data by bluetooth. 
The tool has been manufactured for over 15 years during which time it has earned a reputation in the 
market place as a rugged and reliable tool. Coupled with software developed in-house we also offer a 
Passenger Car Audit System (“PCAS”), which has recently received its first significant order.

New Joint Brokers  
The Company announced the appointment of Beaufort Securities Limited ("Beaufort") as joint broker to 
the Company to improve the service available to the large group of private investors interested in 
Transense. Beaufort have a large network of UK retail and High Net Worth investors and will provide retail 
tailored research on Transense as part of its ongoing services to the Company. 
Capital structure 
During the year, the Company undertook a reduction in share capital by the cancellation of the deferred 
shares and the share premium account. This action should provide a better base to facilitate the Company 
having distributable reserves and in turn enabling the payment of dividends from income or return of capital 
to shareholders from major licensing transactions or partial disposals from profits arising in future. 
Additionally, the ordinary share capital was subject to a 50:1 consolidation to mitigate the effect of prior 
dilutions on the unit price per share, and to reduce trading spreads and transaction costs for shareholders 
in future dealings. 
Prospects  
The Board believes that the technology and products developed by the Group are now well positioned in 
their marketplaces. It anticipates that the market traction demonstrated to date will continue to build and 
is accordingly cautiously optimistic of future prospects.
