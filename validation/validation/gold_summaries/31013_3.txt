The Group delivered an outstanding 
performance in 2017 , increasing 
profit before taxation by 44% (50%*) 
to a record £40.6m (2016: £28.1m). 
All of the Group’s regions delivered 
increases in both gross profit (net fee  
income) and operating profit and 71%  
(2016: 69%) of the Group’s net fee 
income is now derived from overseas 
businesses.  
Revenue was up 17% (14%*) to £1.2bn (2016:  
£1.0bn) and net fee income increased by 
24% (20%*) to £345.2m (2016: £278.3m). 
Operating profit was up 60% (54%*) to 
£41.9m (2016: £26.2m) and earnings per 
share increased by 55% to 42.9p per share 
(2016: 27.7p per share). 
The Group further strengthened its balance 
sheet with net cash of £31. 1m as at 31 
December 2017 (31 December 2016: 
£22.5m). The Group’s ratio of permanent 
and contract recruitment net fee income 
is 68% permanent to 32% contract (2016: 
69%:31%).
During the year, headcount increased by 
17% to 3,793 (2016: 3,229). Headcount 
investment is highest in those regions and 
business units demonstrating the strongest 
potential for accelerated growth.
The Board will be recommending a 50% 
increase in the final dividend to 9.3p per share  
which combined with the interim dividend 
of 2.75p per share would result in a 42% 
increase in the total dividend to 12.05p  
per share (2016: 8.5p). 
In 2017, the Group purchased 2.1m shares 
at an average price of £3.79 for £8.0m, which  
were subsequently cancelled. An additional  
0.4m shares were purchased at an average 
price of £4.03 for £1.8m through the Group’s 
Employee Benefit Trust. The Board is 
authorised to re-purchase up to 10% of 
the Group’s issued share capital and will 
be seeking approval for the renewal of this 
authority at the Annual General Meeting  
on 17 May 2018.
As recently announced, I will be stepping 
down from my role as the Group’s Non-
Executive Chairman on 1 March. It has been  
a privilege to serve on the Board for the past  
five years and I have absolutely no doubt that  
the Robert Walters Group will continue to go  
from strength to strength. I would like to take  
this opportunity, one final time, to thank all 
of the Group’s staff for their hard work and 
support in delivering a high-quality service 
to our candidates and clients.
