 Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report we delivered strong operational and 
financial performance during a year of important strategic 
initiatives. In addition to our successful listing on the London 
Stock Exchange, we continue to make progress against our 
strategic objectives. Our continued focus on strong customer 
relationships, engineering excellence and growing our business 
in markets where we have deep experience and capabilities lies 
at the heart of our success. 
2017 performance overview
The Group has delivered positive annual results for 2017, 
which were fully in line with the Board’s expectations. Reported 
revenue grew by 4.2% to €3,491 million (2016: €3,349 million) 
and by 5.4% at constant currency. Profit for the year grew by 
€71 million to €115 million (2016: €44 million). Adjusted Free 
Cash Flow was €119 million (2016: €83 million). 
Corporate developments
We were extremely pleased with the success of our Global 
Offer and the listing of our shares on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Global Offer raised net proceeds of approximately €360 million, 
which together with positive free cash flow generation were 
used to reduce financial leverage to facilitate achievement of 
a 1.8 x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and reduce the cost 
of financing. Our strengthened balance sheet positions us well 
to continue delivering our strategy and strong stakeholder returns. 
Governance 
Sound corporate governance structures have always formed 
part of the culture of TI Fluid Systems. The business is run by 
an experienced and well respected management team including 
Bill Kozyra, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Timothy 
Knutson, Chief Financial Officer. Together they have advanced 
the business through changing markets. 
The Corporate Governance report on pages 32 to 43 sets out 
and explains the processes we have put in place that will assist 
the Board in the delivery of long‑ term, sustainable value to our 
shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Becoming a listed company has necessitated some governance 
enhancements, including changes to our Board. We were 
pleased to strengthen the Board with the appointment of two 
new Independent Non‑ Executive Directors, John Smith and 
Jeffrey Vanneste. 
Dialogue with shareholders
I would like to thank all our shareholders for their support during 
and following our IPO. This is our first Annual Report as a public 
company and over time our reporting will evolve to encompass 
a broader range of issues related to your Company.
Dividend
The Board has adopted a dividend policy that targets a dividend 
pay‑ out ratio of approximately 30% of the Group’s Adjusted 
Net Income. Accordingly, the Board is recommending an initial 
dividend of 1.31 euro cents per share, to cover the period from 
the date of listing on 25 October 2017 to 31 December 2017. 
Subject to shareholder approval, the dividend will be paid on 
1 June 2018 to shareholders on the register on 27 April 2018.
Our people
The progress we made in 2017 was due to the commitment of 
all our employees. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our employees for their hard work and contribution to this 
year’s performance. We are proud of our record of investing in 
our people, giving them the skills they need to deliver for our 
customers and advance their careers.
Outlook
While still relatively early in 2018, we are encouraged by the 
continued progress of the Group. TI Fluid Systems has a strong 
track record of delivering sustained growth, strong profitability 
and cash flow generation. As the megatrend of hybrid electric 
vehicle (‘HEV’) and electric vehicle (‘EV’) growth begins to 
accelerate, we expect success addressing those markets with 
our existing and new product offerings. Global markets continue 
to be strong and the Board is confident about our prospects 
for continued success in 2018 and beyond.
