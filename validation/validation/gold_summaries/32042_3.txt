A HISTORY OF  
CREATING SOLUTIONS 
Innovation has been at the heart of our business since we began life 
in 1974. As the UK’s original financial spread betting provider, we 
introduced a completely new, accessible way for people to trade on 
gold – by defining it as an index.
Over subsequent years, we went on to expand the product set and 
create increasingly advanced technology to support our clients’ 
trading needs. Our innovations have included the first online 
dealing platform for financial spread betting in 1998 and the 
first trading app for Apple Watch in 2015. This year we delivered 
a completely new trading platform that is beginning to greatly 
enhance the trading experience for our clients. An intuitive, 
customisable interface offers straightforward functionality for 
the less-experienced trader, while those with more demanding 
requirements have access to a range of advanced functions. 
Technology has also enabled us to continually refine our marketing 
techniques. As we discuss in more detail later, we’re now able to 
produce highly targeted advertising campaigns that introduce our 
products to the people they are most likely to suit. A sophisticated 
application and onboarding process then ensures that only 
appropriate clients proceed – gaining access to the products and 
educational materials that fit their objectives, knowledge and 
capital resources.
Over the years, we’ve evolved and broadened our product  
offering to meet the changing needs of traders and investors, 
and it’s now supported by an extensive range of tools and 
resources to help our clients. From teaching essential trading and 
risk-management techniques to providing market insight and alerts 
about upcoming economic events, our educational and news 
services draw on four decades of experience to help people trade 
and invest more effectively. 
Our operating model and risk management strategy have been 
thoroughly tested over time, and have proved highly resilient in 
a wide range of real-life scenarios. Our business has continuously 
adapted to a changing economic backdrop, and we remain agile 
and innovative in the face of an uncertain regulatory landscape, as 
we look to the next phase of our growth.
OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS
We have sales offices across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and the US, and our expertise in online marketing, search 
engine optimisation and multi-language client service has enabled us to extend our reach into countries where we have no physical 
presence. Using a centralised marketing strategy, we connect with clients in 156 countries – efficiently and cost-effectively. 
Our UK headquarters in the City of London is supported by two major operational hubs in Krakow, Poland, and Bangalore, India. These are 
positioned to take advantage of local pools of talent in a variety of disciplines.

Smart Portfolios
Launched in April 2017 in partnership with BlackRock,  
IG Smart Portfolios is a discretionary managed investment 
service. By offering low costs and full transparency on total cost 
of ownership, we are industry-leading. Clients have a fully online 
experience – supported by our customer services team if needed 
– with access to an elegant and intuitive platform, where their 
investments and all the costs of ownership are clearly visible.
We offer a range of portfolios designed to suit different risk 
appetites, each constructed from iShares exchange traded 
funds (ETFs) and including a blend of commodities, equities and 
fixed-income assets designed to match the degree of caution or 
aggression desired by the client.
Our asset allocation strategy is devised in partnership with 
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. We manage 
and rebalance the client’s portfolio for the entire lifetime of 
the investment.
Our research indicates a growing appetite among consumers for 
a product that enables them to build sophisticated baskets of 
investments online, rather than to choose specific shares.
OUR BUSINESS continued
OUR PRODUCT SUITE
Our range of products is designed to provide solutions across the 
spectrum of our clients’ trading and investment needs. 
Our original offering – still core to our business – is leveraged 
trading: contracts for difference (CFDs) and spread betting (in the 
UK and Ireland), which generates the majority of our revenue. This 
is now complemented by a growing suite of non-leveraged share 
dealing and wealth-management products, suiting a broad range of 
risk appetites and trading and investment objectives throughout a 
client’s lifetime.
While our original products are designed for active traders, our 
newer offering extends our reach both to self-directed investors and 
those preferring a low-cost managed-portfolio approach. Attracting 
clients who seek longer-term investments, this broader product 
range is now fully live in the UK, and we‘ve introduced share trading 
to Australia.
We believe that IG is well placed to disrupt the long-term 
investment market and further engage our clients – enabling 
us, over the longer term, to build a new revenue stream for our 
business. We’ve been able to develop our offering extremely 
cost-effectively, by building on our existing technology, teams and 
infrastructure, and by leveraging the established strength of our 
brand and marketing capabilities.
IG clients are able to access over 15,000 global financial markets – 
including shares, forex, indices, commodities and other instruments 
– via market-leading platforms and apps that provide efficient, 
secure execution. 
 
Contracts for Difference (CFDs) 
CFDs are derivatives contracts that enable clients to take advantage 
of changes in an asset’s price, without owning the asset itself. 
Clients can take a position in a financial instrument, buying or 
selling, while only putting down a small percentage of the value 
of their trade as security – known as trading on margin. This is an 
extremely efficient way of trading financial markets over the short 
term. We also offer clients access to a range of risk-mitigation 
measures, including stops and limits and a limited risk account.
• We are the world’s No.1 CFD provider
(1)
We explain how a CFD works in the IG Services section on IG.com.
Spread Betting
Financial spread betting mirrors many aspects of a CFD – enabling 
clients to take advantage of changes in an asset’s price without 
owning the asset itself, and to use the same range of risk-mitigation 
measures. Available only in the UK and Ireland, it’s a tax-free
(2)
 
alternative to trading, allowing clients to bet on the price movement 
of an asset. The size of a client’s win or loss depends on the 
magnitude and direction of the price movement.
• We are the UK’s largest and longest-running spread 
betting provider
(3)
• We hold 45% of the UK financial spread betting market
(4)
We explain how spread betting works in the IG Services section 
on IG.com.
Share dealing, ISAs and SIPPs
Our online, execution-only share dealing service is powered by the 
same market-leading technology as our spread betting and CFD 
offering. It enables self-directed clients to buy and sell over 9,000 
global shares and exchange traded funds (ETFs), with extremely 
competitive and transparent transaction fees. They can also choose 
to invest within a tax-efficient ISA or SIPP wrapper, and there’s an 
option to use stock portfolios as collateral for leveraged trading.
Launched in the UK in 2014, our share dealing offering has built 
on our pedigree in the online leveraged trading sector. As well as 
providing our current spread betting and CFD clients with facilities 
to place their non-leveraged portfolio with us, we’re now attracting 
a completely new audience to IG. Our share dealing service is also 
available to clients in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland and the 
Netherlands, and in this financial year we introduced it to Australia 
as Share Trading.
• The market in the UK for online, execution-only share dealing is 
around ten times the size of the market for leveraged products
(5)
 
• Around 80% of clients opening share dealing accounts are new 
to IG
Nadex
Nadex is our US derivatives exchange, enabling US 
and overseas investors to trade options on global 
financial markets in retail-sized contracts.
Our main product is the binary option, which 
provides a flexible way for clients to trade with 
limited risk. However, our spread product, which is also limited risk, 
is growing in popularity.
Nadex is benefitting from renewed consumer interest in retail 
trading, and increased client volumes have been driven by ongoing 
improvements to our products and platform, supported by 
enhanced liquidity from a new market-maker partnership.
• Nadex is the first and largest US-based retail-oriented exchange
• The business has seen a two-year compound growth rate of 63%
Digital 100s
Our digital 100s are a type of financial derivative with limited risk: 
clients know exactly how much they can potentially gain or lose at 
the outset, and can’t lose more than they have on their account.
A digital 100 is a simplified form of option that offers a yes/no 
outcome over a specified time period. If the trader makes the 
correct choice, they make a defined profit. If they choose wrongly, 
they make no return and lose the amount required to open 
the trade.
Timeframes can vary from five minutes to daily, weekly or monthly, 
and we offer a wide range of markets. As well as indices, forex and 
commodities, clients can trade on special markets such as political 
events and economic announcements.
