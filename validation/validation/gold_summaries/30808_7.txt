 52 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS
Record annual results driven by strong performance across all businesses
In its final year before the forthcoming demerger, supported by the continued macroeconomic performance of Georgia, BGEO Group has 
delivered another year of strong earnings momentum. Growth and returns in both the Banking Business and the Investment Businesses, now 
renamed Georgia Capital, continue to be high. Following the completion of the demerger, we are confident both companies are independently 
extremely well positioned to continue their excellent recent track record for many years to come.
In line with IFRS requirements, the Group reviewed the classification of its operating segments at 31 December 2017. Given the expectation, in line 
with Georgia Capital’s strategy it is highly probable the Group will own less than a 50% stake in GHG at the end of 2018*. As a result, and in line with 
IFRS, the Group classified GHG as “disposal group held for sale” and its results of operations are reported under “discontinued operations” line as 
a single amount in the consolidated income statement. Comparative periods have been restated accordingly to reflect reclassification of GHG from 
“continuing operations” into “discontinued operations.” Assets and liabilities held by GHG are also presented separately in the consolidated balance 
sheet as of 31 December 2017 under “assets of disposal group held for sale” and “liabilities of disposal group held for sale.”

ratio adjusted for discounted value of 
collateral stood at 130.6% at 31 December 
2017 (132.1% at 31 December 2016).  
The asset quality improvement positively 
impacted the cost of risk ratio, which stood 
at 2.2% in 2017 (2.7% in 2016)
• Retail Banking (“RB”) continued to 
deliver strong growth across all its 
business lines. Retail Banking revenue 
reached GEL 614.7 million in 2017, up 
24.4% y-o-y. The number of Retail Banking 
clients reached 2.3 million at the end of 
2017, up 8.1% from 2.1 million at the  
end of 2016
• Our Retail Banking product to client ratio 
increased to 2.2 in 2017 from 2.0 in 2016. 
In 4Q17 we completed the transformation  
of our Retail Banking operations from a 
product-based model into a client-centric 
model, as well as the implementation of the 
client-centric model in our branches. As of 
31 December 2017, we had 86 transformed 
branches. We continue to see outstanding 
growth in sales volumes and the number  
of products sold to our clients in these 
branches, contributing to 29.3% y-o-y 
growth in the retail loan book
• The loan book growth on a constant-
currency basis reached 17.4% at 
31 December 2017. As a result, Retail 
Banking’s loan book share in the total  
loan portfolio was 68.0% at 31 December 
2017 (60.9% at 31 December 2016).  
The Retail Banking net loan book reached

currency basis was 30.6% y-o-y
• Retail Banking client deposits increased 
to GEL 3,267.3 million at 31 December

• Corporate Investment Banking (“CIB”) 
resumed growth in 4Q17 after delivering

portfolio repositioning targets in 3Q17. 
CIB’s net loan book amounted to  
GEL 2,260.1 million at 31 December 2017, 
down 5.6% y-o-y, but up 13.4% q-o-q. The 
top ten CIB client exposure was 10.7% at 
31 December 2017, down from 11.8% at 
31 December 2016. Consequently, CIB’s 
profit increased to GEL 105.9 million in 2017 
(up 19.9% y-o-y) and CIB ROAE reached 
17.6% in 2017 (up from 14.7% in 2016)
• Investment Management’s Assets Under 
Management (“AUM”) increased to  
GEL 1,857.5 million, up 17.9% y-o-y, 
reflecting higher bond issuance activity  
by our brokerage arm Galt & Taggart
• IFRS 9 implementation delivered – no 
impact on capital adequacy ratios.  
The Group has completed its IFRS 9 
implementation programme and adopted 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 
2018. The Banking Business will recognise 
the estimated impact from IFRS 9 adoption 
of approximately GEL 31.5 million, gross of 
income tax, as a reduction to shareholders’ 
equity at the transition date on 1 January 
2018. As allowed by IFRS 9, the Group will 
not be restating prior-period data. IFRS 9 
does not have any impact on regulatory 
capital and capital adequacy ratios. 
Through-the-cycle cost of risk is expected 
to remain unchanged. NPL coverage ratio, 
adjusted for additional IFRS 9 allowance, 
was 102.9% as at 31 December 2017
• Amendments to Capital Adequacy 
requirements. In order to transition to 
 Basel III, the National Bank of Georgia 
(“NBG”) introduced new capital adequacy 
requirements in December 2017. As a result 
of the changes, Bank of Georgia became 
subject to the following minimum capital 
requirements at 31 December 2017:
 – Common Equity Tier 1 ratio 8.1%, 
expected to increase to 9.5% on 
31 December 2018
 – Tier 1 ratio 9.9%, expected to increase 
to 11.4% on 31 December 2018
 – Total Capital ratio 12.4%, expected to 
increase to 16.0% on 31 December 
2018
 At 31 December 2017, both of Bank of 
Georgia’s Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 
ratios were 12.4%, while Total Capital ratio 
was 17.9%. Transition to Basel III is not 
expected to affect the Bank’s growth 
prospects or its ability to maintain dividend 
distributions within the existing dividend 
policy payout range. 54 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS CONTINUED
INVESTMENT BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
• Our utility and energy business, GGU, 
delivered a stable performance in 2017. 
GGU continued its investments in water 
pipeline infrastructure, leading to continued 
growth in the regulated asset base and 
reduction of the respective water losses. 
Due to successfully implemented efficiency 
projects, GGU was able to significantly 
reduce its own electricity consumption in 
2017. GGU also continued the construction 
works on the 50MW Mestiachala HPPs in 
North-Western Georgia, while the 44.3MW 
Zoti HPPs entered their construction phase

new Regulatory Asset Base methodology 
adopted by GNERC in August 2017. The 
new tariffs have been set for a three-year

“asset light” strategy and will construct  
and develop a residential complex under

plot to generate construction fees, sales 
commissions and a share from the project’s 
overall profit
• In 2017, m
2
 acquired a controlling stake 
in an upcoming lifestyle boutique hotel in 
a prime location of Tbilisi, which is expected 
to add at least 100 rooms to m
2
’s portfolio

and completion is planned for the first half

• Aldagi delivered its best ever year as it 
continued organic growth primarily in the 
motor insurance, property insurance and 
credit life lines, as Aldagi shifted its focus 
more to the retail market. New product 
development initiatives and enhancements 
of existing products resulted in more than 
19,000 livestock insurance policies and 
3,334 travel and trip insurance policies 
sold across the country in 2017
• In 2017 Aldagi signed major third-party 
partnership agreements with two 
Georgian banks, JSC Liberty Bank and 
JSC Credo Bank to successfully diversify  
its multi-channel distribution network, which 
will enable Aldagi to successfully tap into 
Georgia’s underpenetrated retail insurance 
segment
• Our beverage business, Teliani, achieved 
significant milestones during 2017 and 
launched its mainstream beer and 
lemonade production in June 2017 and

sold approximately 300,000 litres of craft 
beer in 2017, primarily targeting restaurants 
and bars in Tbilisi
• Our healthcare business, GHG, continued 
to deliver on its strategic priorities across 
its businesses. Healthcare services EBITDA 
margin continued to be high at 26.4% in 
2017, notwithstanding the dilutive effect  
of the significant roll-out of the two major 
hospital renovations and the ongoing roll-out 
of a nationwide chain of polyclinics 
(outpatient clinics). In the pharmacy 
business we have made significant progress 
towards the integration of our two recently 
acquired businesses, whilst avoiding any 
significant business disruption. As a result, 
the EBITDA margin of 8.6% for the year has 
already successfully exceeded our target of 
“more than 8%” margin
• In January 2018, GHG’s medical 
insurance arm signed a new medical 
insurance agreement with the Georgian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, the country’s

the number of GHG’s insured individuals 
reached approximately 155,000
