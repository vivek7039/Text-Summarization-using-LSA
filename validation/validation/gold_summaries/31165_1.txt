Chief Executive’s review
We are pleased to have 
delivered another record year 
of profit, further demonstrating 
that our strategy of being 
diversified by sector and 
geography is working, with 
adjusted profit before tax 
growing 20% to £11.0m 
(2016: £9.2m).
Group performance in the year
We are pleased to have delivered another 
record year of profit, further demonstrating 
that our strategy of being diversified by 
sector and geography is working, with 
adjusted profit before tax growing 20% 
to £11.0m (2016: £9.2m). The 2017 results 
include a full year of contribution from 
the investments made in 2016 in Rishworth 
Aviation and ConSol Partners.
Group revenue increased by 32% to 
£357.1m (2016: £270.4m), with net fee 
income up 18% to £69.4m (2016: £59.0m). 
Our strongest results were in Japan (IT & 
design sector), Chile (retail sector) and in 
the professional services and other 
specialist sectors of the UK. Permanent 
revenue was up 14% and temporary and 
contract revenue was up 34%.
The two investments made in 2016 have 
integrated well into the Group. Rishworth 
Aviation has performed in line with our 
expectations. The decision was taken 
to incur professional fees to support the 
set-up of new bases of operations for 
key clients, which are already generating 
profitable returns and further consolidate 
their position as a key business partner. 
Our investment in ConSol has also been 
positive, with the UK office trading well and 
expanding their operations in Continental 
Europe. We have invested in the US office, 
bringing in more experienced staff and 
increasing their focus on temporary sales. 
There has been a positive contribution 
in the second half of the year from these 
changes and we see a good momentum 
moving into 2018.
We have continued to invest in our Group, 
with Monroe Consulting launching in 
Vietnam, a new country for the Group. This 
operation has started well and complements 
their existing footprint across South East 
Asia. The Group has also seen average 
staff numbers increase by 7% as we 
continue to invest in line with our leading 
brands strategy. In the UK, two brands 
were merged into FastTrack (technical & 
industrial) and LMA (professional services), 
which are expected to provide both 
operational and cost synergies in the 
coming years.

With a Group operating in 20 countries 
and across various sectors, it is unrealistic 
to expect all brands to be performing at 
their peak at the same time. Our organic 
performance in the year has been impacted 
by weaker performances, primarily within 
the technical & industrial sector, and actions 
have been taken to make changes where 
required. At the net fee income level, the 
growth was driven by the investments 
made in 2016, with organic growth of 1%, 
although once currency benefits are 
removed, the constant currency organic 
net fees decreased by 3%. Germany and 
the Middle East were our weaker markets 
in the period. We saw a reduction in net 
fee income in Germany following the 
introduction of new legislation to limit the 
amount of time a worker can be treated as 
a temporary worker at the same client to 
18 months as well as new minimum wage 
rules. We have been proactive in managing 
this position with worker rotations but this 
has resulted in lower temporary margins 
and a subsequent decline in profit. In the 
Middle East we have incurred restructuring 
costs in the year, bringing the cost base 
in line with current trading and whilst loss 
making, it was an improvement on the prior 
year and we saw a positive trend across the 
second half. In the UK a mixture of changes 
within the sales team and merger costs 
have put pressure on the results. As part of 
a mid-term growth plan, we will be investing 
further. The fact that we were able to deliver 
a record result in 2017, despite difficulties in 
certain markets, underlines the benefit of 
our strategy to be diversified across sectors 
and geographies and so not being reliant 
on any single market.
The Group temporary margin was 12.7% 
(2016: 14.5%) with the reduction mainly due 
to the full year impact of Rishworth Aviation, 
which has a high revenue and relatively low 
gross margin percentage, and the lower 
margins in Germany. The mix of net fee 
income was consistent with the prior year, 
with 60% from temporary and contract 
sales and 40% from permanent sales. The 
share of net fees from professional and 
specialist levels increased to 87% (2016: 
86%). The Group generated 66% of net fee 
income from outside the UK (2016: 68%).
We have seen another improvement in our 
conversion ratio, albeit a small increase to 
16.7% (2016: 16.6%). This represents six 
years of consecutive improvement, although 
the rate of growth was held back by costs 
incurred on exiting property leases in the 
UK, non-exceptional restructuring costs 
and investing in new staff. We have a clear 
focus to manage our costs, allowing 
investment in building the teams, but always 
looking for ways to operate more efficiently, 
with a particular focus on staff productivity.
STAFF PRODUCTIVITY
This is the key productivity ratio we monitor, 
demonstrating staff efficiency, calculated 
as the ratio of net fee income generated per 
£1 of staff cost. The staff cost includes all 
sales and administrative staff, reflecting the 
true cost of operating the Group.
Progress: At 1.75 in 2017 we have seen 
a small decline on 1.79 in 2016, but this 
remains above all other years since 2013.

Chief Executive’s review

Within our English speaking brands we have 
started to use our offshore recruitment 
outsourcing business in India to take over 
certain internal accounting processes, to 
deliver consistency, build scale and manage 
costs. Operating profit grew by 2% to 
£8.9m (2016: £8.7m), with higher 
amortisation costs of £1.7m (2016: £1.1m) 
reflecting the recent investments made by 
the Group, as well as a £0.9m loss on 
disposal for exiting the training business in 
Indonesia. The adjusted operating profit, 
stated before amortisation, exceptional 
items, profit or loss on business disposals 
and fair value charges on equity instruments 
grew by 18% to £11.6m (2016: £9.8m).  
The disposal was of a non-core business, 
which joined the Group in 2007. There was 
a need for a significant cash investment  
to restructure it for growth and we did not 
believe it was an ongoing fit with the Group. 
This was an accounting loss only and 
meant we did not need to make any further 
cash injections. 
Profit before tax was up 3% to £8.1m (2016: 
£7.9m), with the underlying adjusted profit 
before tax up 20% to £11.0m (2016: £9.2m). 
Interest costs were level year on year, 
despite the increase in net debt. We also 
had a benefit from the weakness in Sterling 
on the translation of our overseas results. 
On a constant currency basis adjusted 
profit before tax was up 14% but reported 
profit before tax was down 2%. Currency 
has been beneficial for the last two years, 
following the Brexit vote, but based on the 
exchange rates at year end we would not 
expect to see the same benefit during 2018.
Diluted earnings per share was down 15% 
to 7.9p (2016: 9.3p), also impacted by the 
higher amortisation charges and loss on 
disposal. On an adjusted basis there was  
an 11% growth to 12.5p (2016: 11.3p), 
representing the sixth year of double digit 
percentage growth.

NET FEE INCOME GROWTH
Sustainable growth in net fee income is needed 
to deliver long-term growth in net profit and 
earnings per share. 
Target: Average annual growth of 10%.
Progress: 18% (13% in constant currency). 
The  last three years have been at or above our 
target level.

CONVERSION RATIO
This demonstrates how efficiently the business 
is operating and how well the cost base is being 
managed. It is calculated as the percentage 
of adjusted operating profit to net fee income.
Target: Reach 20% ratio by 2018.
Progress: 16.7%, being the sixth consecutive 
year of improvement. After the small growth 
in 2017 we do not expect to reach 20% in 2018 
but continue to focus on balancing costs, 
productivity improvements and investments 
to grow net fee income to reach our target.

We are pleased with the

three key measures. We will 
continue to work on improving 
the conversion ratio and all 
three targets remain ongoing 
areas of focus for the Group.

Focus into 2018
Organic growth has always been a core 
part of our business model and despite 
the low overall organic growth in the year, 
this remains a key focus of management. 
We agree specific plans with each brand 
to help them develop into leading brands in 
their sectors and we will continue to invest 
in new staff, locations and markets where 
we see opportunities to grow. We are 
confident that the plans we are following 
will help the Group deliver profitable organic 
growth in 2018.
We have not made any external investments 
during 2017, concentrating on integrating 
the three investments we made over 
a 12 month period from October 2015 to 
October 2016. It was important to settle 
them into the Group before looking for new 
investment opportunities. With the main 
focus on organic growth in 2018, we do 
not currently expect to make any significant 
external investments, but we will continue 
to work on identifying suitable opportunities 
to further develop the Group in line with 
our strategy. As part of balancing our sector 
and geographic coverage, we have 
a particular interest in increasing our 
presence in the Latin American region and 
the healthcare and professional services 
sectors. We also work with our brands to 
identify and execute sector specific bolt-on 
acquisition opportunities, to help accelerate 
their growth plans.

DEBT AS A % OF DEBTORS
This demonstrates how leveraged the Group is. 
The Group needs a sound financial foundation 
for long-term sustainability and to be able to 
react to opportunities in the market. 
Target: To reduce this to 25% by 2018.
Progress: This increased to 45% from 38% 
in the prior year due to the acquisition based 
payments made in the year. Having reached 
the target in 2015 we took the decision to make 
two strategic investments using cash and 
debt in 2016, knowing this would significantly 
increase this ratio in the short-term. We expect 
to see this rate reduce in 2018 but not to reach 
the target level.

Over the first four years of 
our plan we have delivered 
a 63% growth in net fee 
income, with 26% from 
organic growth (for 
businesses in the Group 
in 2013), 43% from new 
investments and 6% lost

Board’s decision to operate 
above the long-term debt to
