 I am pleased to report on a strong year of growth for CentralNic.
The Group continued its strategy to build a diversified internet
services business of size and scale through an acquisitive
roll-up programme which delivers high-levels of recurring
revenues, quality of earnings and strong cash generation.
In addition, revenue (10%), gross profit (28%), adjusted
EBITDA (20%) and profit after tax (7%) all show year on year
increases, a pleasing achievement for the Group.
SK-NIC, the manager of the exclusive country code top-level
domain for Slovakia, was acquired in mid-December 2017 for
a maximum cash consideration of €25.7 million (£22.6 million).
The Board anticipates SK-NIC to be earnings enhancing in line
with expectations at the time of the acquisition, as well as
providing access to a new international market with sustainable
growth characteristics, a high renewal rate of over 86%, and
the opportunity to leverage CentralNic’s existing expertise and
bespoke technical platforms in the domain management
business. The acquisition was funded by the Company’s own
cash reserves and a term loan and revolving credit facility
totalling £18 million provided by Silicon Valley Bank, which
also provides a £3 million overdraft facility.
Significant growth was delivered in the Wholesale and Retail
Divisions, which contributed to an increase in recurring revenues
and an improvement in the quality of the Group’s earnings.
As part of that, the exclusive wholesaler contract with XYZ.com,
owner of the .xyz Top-Level Domain (“TLD”), was renegotiated in
September 2017 for a term running until May 2032. CentralNic
receives a fixed minimum fee which may increase based on the
volume of .xyz domains managed.
Whilst the Enterprise Division made a significant contribution to
the Group’s profits in the year under review, its contribution
through one-off domain name sales reduced when compared
to the prior year. In 2017, the Group sold portfolios of premium
domain names valued at a total of £3.0 million (2016: £3.7
million). In line with the Group’s strategy, whilst premium domain
name trading is a profitable activity, premium domain name
sales will be a decreasing proportion of revenues and
contribution going forward as the Company focuses on
building recurring revenue based business activities.
Performance
In the year ended 31 December 2017, revenue rose by 10% to
£24.3 million (2016: £22.1 million). This was driven by organic
growth in the Wholesale Division, which grew by almost 50%,
and also in the Retail Division which grew by almost 10%. Gross
profit increased by 28% to £9.8 million (2016: £7.7 million) with
gross margins ahead of the previous year in all divisions and, in
total 40%, (2016: 35%), an increase of 16%. Despite adverse
foreign exchange movements of £0.6 million, compared to a
positive impact of £0.6 million in 2016, adjusted EBITDA was in
line with market expectations at £6.6 million (2016: £5.5 million),
representing an increase of 20% on the prior year. Profit after
tax increased by 7% to £1.02 million (2016: £0.96 million).
Chairman’s statement
8      CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017
Our vision is to join the ranks of world leaders 
in the industry, as new TLDs (which the Group
distributes) expand to challenge the incumbent
dominant domain name endings (.com etc) 
and emerging markets, like China, grow to 
rival the size of the North American and
European markets.
Mike Turner Chairman Cash flow was positive during the year with year-end cash
balances of £10.9 million (2016: £9.9 million) and net debt
(excluding prepaid costs) of £7.2m (2016: net cash £7.3m).
During the year, CentralNic entered into a new facility
agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which enabled the
Group to acquire SK-NIC and optimise its capital structure
and gain access to funding for growth opportunities.
Diluted earnings per share increased by over 6% to 1.04p
(2016: 0.97p).
Strategy
The Group’s strategy remains to develop and operate scalable
software platforms by serving global markets with domain
names and related services. It continues to identify and exploit
high growth areas within the domain industry, retaining a
leading role in new Top-Level Domains, servicing country
code domains, and focusing on growth markets including
Eastern Europe and Asia. The Group aims to win and retain
well-resourced clients with complementary objectives and to
make acquisitions which meet the clear strategic criteria of
being earnings accretive in the short term with a strong
recurring revenue base, high quality of earnings, and high
cash conversion.
Management and Board
As part of the strategy to build a diversified business of size
and scale, the management team was strengthened to
support the Group’s ambitions. In May 2017, Sarah Ryan
joined CentralNic as Group Corporate Development Director,
following the previous year’s senior hires of Stuart Fuller and
Andy Churley as Group Commercial Director and Group
Marketing Director respectively. The Board itself was
strengthened further in July 2017 with the appointment
of Don Baladasan as Chief Financial Officer, bringing
considerable financial expertise in buy-and-build strategies
and risk management.
In August 2017 Desleigh Jameson, who joined the Group in
January 2016 when it acquired Instra Corporation, stepped
down from the Board. The integration of Instra’s operations in
to the Group was by that time complete following Desleigh’s
hard work in very quickly merging the highly successful Instra
business in to the ever-expanding CentralNic.
I would like to thank all members of the CentralNic team for
their professionalism and commitment to the ongoing growth
and transformation of the business. It is thanks to our staff, to
our clients and to our distribution channel partners, as well as
to our shareholders, that the Group continues to maintain and
enhance its industry-leading position.
Outlook
Our vision is to join the ranks of world leaders in the industry.
CentralNic strives to achieve this by continuing to disrupt
existing markets and by identifying and exploiting key growth
markets around the world. Moreover, ongoing consolidation
in the domain services industry presents step-change
acquisition opportunities for the Group to enter new markets
and broaden its service offerings.
Trading for the first quarter of 2018 is encouraging and inline
with expectations. CentralNic has continued to win new clients
including the distribution contract for .ooo TLD, owned by the
billion-dollar Mumbai-listed tech company Infibeam. In January
2018 the Group replenished its premium domain trading
inventory by acquiring a portfolio of domain names for a total
consideration of £2.5 million.
As reported in March 2018, discussions are taking place
regarding the potential combination of CentralNic and
KeyDrive S.A. The combination of the two businesses has
strong strategic logic and economies of scale. This represents
an opportunity to create a group with advanced technology
platforms delivering significant recurring revenues for every
major customer type within the industry. Although there can be
no certainty that a transaction will occur, the discussions are
proceeding well and the Board believes that the transaction
will take place in the third quarter of 2018.
The Board believes that the opportunity to continue to build a
sizeable business to rival the largest industry players, using the
Group’s existing infrastructure to deliver economies of scale
both financially and operationally, remains strong. The Group’s
management team has proven its ability to deliver and
integrate substantial acquisitions and there is a plentiful
pipeline of targets. The Directors are confident that the Group
will continue to deliver on its strategic goals in 2018, to deliver
growth both organically and by expansion of the business and
further improve the percentage of recurring revenues and the
Group’s quality of earnings.
