 STRATEGIC REPORT
I am delighted to report, in our first set of results 
as a public company, a year of good progress in 
line with our plans.
Group revenue from continuing operations increased by  
4.6%
1
 to £1,814.8 million, adjusted EBITDA
2
 increased by 4.2%
  
to £152.6 million and operating profit increased by 5.1% to  
£96.2 million.
In the UK, our business is based on strong, long-term customer 
relationships and this has helped us to manage the impact of 
inflation which, together with good volumes, has resulted in 
revenue growth of 4.6
 
%
1
. Innovation is at the heart of these 
relationships and during the year we launched over 500 new 
products for our customers, such as the UK’s first ever range  
of charcoal-base pizzas to create further differentiation in  
the market.
Our International business is much smaller, but growing in line 
with our plans. We have seen this particularly in China, where  
our customers are expanding rapidly and extending their fresh 
offering. In the US, we are steadily pushing out our boundaries, 
both geographically and in terms of range, as the market develops 
its taste for fresh prepared products. The new dedicated factory to 
service a significant customer in Texas is on track and expected to 
be operational in the second half of 2018.
Although we continue our investment in both new facilities and the 
upgrade of existing factories, cash generation in the year was 
strong, and this, combined with the benefits from the March 
refinancing and the listing proceeds received, resulted in net debt 
being just 1.8 times adjusted EBITDA

 at the end of December.
Looking ahead, whilst we see the widely reported risks to the  
UK economy from inflation and some general uncertainty around 
the Brexit process, we believe that Bakkavor is well-placed for 
continuing profitable growth in a segment of the food market 
which is still showing strong dynamics. We continue to take a 
long-term perspective of our business and any passing turbulence 
will not deflect us from the strategy we are working to. Growth 
prospects in our international markets remain very positive and 
we will capitalise on these in the coming years.
We are very proud to have become a listed company in November 
and I would like to welcome the many new shareholders who have 
joined us at that time and since. 
In October 2017, I succeeded Lydur Gudmundsson as  
Chairman. Lydur is the co-founder of Bakkavor and, along  
with Agust, takes credit for building the business into what it  
is today. His experience and knowledge remain invaluable to  
us and I am delighted that he will continue to be part of the  
Group Board. Meanwhile I welcome Sue Clark, who joined us  
in November, and I am also delighted that Denis Hennequin  
has become our Senior Independent Director. Jane Lodge  
also joined us as an independent Non-executive Director on  
3 April 2018 andI welcome her too.
Bakkavor employs more than 19,000 people across the Group, 
including 17,000 in the UK. They all work at the highest standards 
to make great tasting food consistently and safely. Many are 
potentially impacted by the Brexit process and we have been 
working to support them at a time of significant personal 
uncertainty. I would like to thank them for their contribution,  
on which these results have been built.
As set out in the public listing prospectus, no dividend will be 
declared in respect of the 2017 financial year. The Group has 
confirmed its intention that a dividend equivalent to 40% of 
adjusted profit after tax for the financial year 2018 will be paid, 
with an interim payment in September 2018 of approximately one 
third of the expected total for the year.
1 Growth versus Full Year 2016 on a 52 week basis.
2 Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”), including ‘like-for-like’, ‘adjusted’ and ‘underlying’ are used as a guide to performance.  
The definitions and calculations for APMs are set out in Note 41 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
