 Dear	Shareholder,
I	am	delighted	to	announce,	on	behalf	of	the	Board	of	
Van Elle Holdings	plc,	a positive	set	of	results	for	the	year	
ended 30 April	2017.	This	is	the first	full	year	statement	following	
the successful	Initial	Public	Offering	(“IPO”)	on	the	Alternative	
Investment	Market	(“AIM”)	of	the	London	Stock	Exchange	in	
October 2016.	
Van	Elle’s	equity	story,	which	centred	around	the	Company’s	
leading	position	in	the	UK,	its	differentiated	offering	and	attractive	
end	markets,	supported	by	a	strong	financial	profile,	a	well	invested	
platform	and	a	strategy	for	growth,	was	well	received	by	investors.
Although	we	have	only	been	a	quoted	company	for	a	short	time,	
I believe	that	we	have	made	much	progress	across	the	business	
and confidence	is	high.	It	is	thanks	to the	hard	work	put	in	by	our	
talented	management	team,	as	well	as	those	working	across	and	
with	the	business,	that	we	could	make	this	progress	and	create	
the foundation	from	which	to continue	to	grow	our	operation.
Highlights
I	am	pleased	that	in	our	maiden	results	as	a	quoted	company	
Van Elle has	reported	an	11.8%	increase	in	revenue	to	£94.1m	
(2016:	£84.2m)	and	an	underlying	operating	profit	of	£11.6m	
(2016:	£11.1m),	representing	a	record	year	and	continuing	our	
impressive	year‑on‑year	profitable	growth.
These	results	reflect	our	continuing	strategic	drive	to	focus	on	
growth	markets,	enabled	by	targeted	investment	in	specialist	rigs,	
expansion	of	our	precast	concrete	manufacturing	capabilities	and	
further	expansion	of our	geographical	footprint	in	Scotland,	
serviced	by	a	dedicated	facility	at	Blantyre,	Glasgow.
The	IPO	in	October	2016,	together	with	the	funds	raised,	strengthens	
our	balance	sheet	and	gives	us	the	flexibility	to	invest	in	new	
equipment	and	consider	acquisitions	that	complement	our strategy	
for	growth.
As	a	company,	we	have	worked	hard	to	bring	together	a team	that	has	
the	right	combination	of	sector	knowledge	and	corporate	experience	
to	enable	us	to	deliver on	our	vision	and strategy.
Dividend
As	a	quoted	company,	one	of	our	key	ongoing	objectives	is	to	create	
shareholder	value.	The	Board	has	adopted	a	progressive	dividend	policy	
and,	having	paid	an	interim	dividend	of	0.85p,	is	recommending	a	final	
dividend	of	1.75p,	making	a	total	of	2.6p	for	the	financial	year.

STRATEGIC REPORT Board and governance
On	behalf	of	the	Board,	I	would	like	to	express	our	thanks	to	
Michael	Ellis,	who	retired	from	the	Board	in	December	2016.	
Michael,	along	with	his	wife,	Joan,	founded	the	business	some	
33 years	ago	and	their	contribution	during	that	time	has	been	
invaluable.	Michael	and	Joan	created	the	high‑quality	company	that	
Van	Elle	now	is	and	I	would	like	to	wish	them	a	happy	retirement.
I	am	delighted	to	follow	Michael	Ellis	as	Chairman	of	Van Elle Holdings	plc	
and	I	am	joined	by	Robin	Williams	as	Senior Independent	Director.	
Robin	chairs	the	Audit	Committee	and sits on the	Remuneration	and	
Nomination	Committees,	both	of which	I chair.	We	are	joined	on	the	
Board	by	the	two	Executive	Directors:	Jon	Fenton	as	Chief Executive	
Officer	and	Paul	Pearson	as Chief	Financial	Officer.	The Board	intends	
to	recruit	a	further	Non‑Executive	Director	to	broaden	the	experience	
and	support	offered	to	the	Company	during	the	new	financial	year.
I	would	also	like	to	thank	Thomas	Lindup,	who	left	the	Board	as	Executive 
Director	in	March 2017.	Thomas	joined	the	Company	in 2015	and	
helped	steer the	Group	through	its	successful	IPO	in October 2016.
As	a	board,	we	are	committed	to	promoting	the	highest	standards	
of corporate	governance	and	ensuring	effective	communication	
with	shareholders.	We	intend	to	apply	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	
Code	as	far	as	it	is	appropriate	for	a	company	of	its	size	and	our	
corporate	governance	statement	is	included	on	pages	36	and	37.
People
Van	Elle	has	an	outstanding	group	of	employees	and	we	continue	
to	place	great	importance	on	their	engagement.	Our	objective	is	
to provide	opportunities	for	development,	personal	growth	and	
successful	careers	with	the	Company.
All	our	staff	have	gone	through	a	year	of	significant	change.	They	
have	coped	admirably	and	delivered	an	excellent	result.	On	your	
behalf	and	on	behalf	of	the	Board,	I	wish	to	formally	record	our	thanks.
Outlook
The	fundamental	market	drivers	for	our	business	look	positive	in	
the	short	and	medium	terms.	The	order	book	remains	in	line	with	
our	expectations	and	we	are	well	placed	in	each	of	our	markets.	
This	is	an	exciting	time	to	be	part	of	Van	Elle	as	we	seek	to	build	
on the	performance outlined	in these	accounts.	As	a	profitable	and	
fast‑growing	geotechnical	engineering	company,	I	am	confident	
that	the	Company	has	an exciting	year	ahead.	The	Board	looks	
forward	to meeting	shareholders	at	the	Annual	General	Meeting	
(“AGM”)	on	12 September	2017.
