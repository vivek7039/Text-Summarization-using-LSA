Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Operating Review of the 
Business by the CEO
Since then, there have been a number of significant 
changes in the Group: firstly, the sale of the Football 
Pools, which post completion saw two existing 
Directors move on; and secondly, the Formal Sale 
Process which followed a number of unsolicited 
approaches for the Group as a whole.
The Group emerged from this period leaner and more 
invigorated, executing strategies that include the 
continued expansion of our international footprint in 
Racing and Digital, and the ongoing development of 
the Bump 50:50 product focused on the charitable 
foundations of tier-one professional sports teams. 
We are also pursuing further deployment of online 
and mobile platforms to drive growth and reduce 
operational costs, and diversification into new forms 
of gaming, including sports wagering, as and when 
regulations permit, both in the Venues business and in 
the US Racing and Digital business.
The Group now has two operating divisions: Racing 
and Digital (including Bump 50:50), and Venues.

Andrew Gaughan, CEO
I am pleased to address the 
Sportech shareholders as the 
Group’s new Chief Executive 
Officer, having been appointed to 
that position on 14 March 2018, 
although I joined the Board in 
January 2017.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Despite missing our 2017 international sales targets, 
the Racing and Digital division’s core recurring tote 
technology service and Bump 50:50 revenues have 
progressed well, providing a clear indication of 
longer term sustained earnings growth and value 
creation emanating from the technology and business 
investments already made.
The sales anticipated in 2017 that did not come to 
fruition have not yet been closed and continue to be 
considered realistic opportunities. Some of these have 
been rolled into our 2018 pipeline, including multiple 
projects in Asia and Europe such as our recently-
announced Quantum™ System upgrade sale to Royal 
Sabah Turf Club of Malaysia. After four years of strong 
sales revenues, with annual average sales exceeding 
USD6.5million and contribution margins of 45%, 2017 
is considered an unusually low sales year. However, 
continued strong growth in recurring commingling 
service revenues helped offset this one-time relatively 
soft year in sales.
Developments
In 2017, key technology advances in the core 
Quantum™ System software were realised and the 
global commingling business grew significantly 
through high-value connections between the UK, 
Asia, Europe, and North America, facilitated by the 
global network of Quantum™ Data and Operations 
Centres. These are Sportech’s proprietary products 
and centres.
The capacity of the Quantum™ System-supported 
global pools and bet types was significantly expanded 
to include exotic complex parlays, of particular 
interest to customers in Asia, and the popular  
French pools offered by ZEturf and PMU.
The North American footprint was strengthened, 
executing 13 long-term contract extensions with 
existing customers, and we further expanded the 
global footprint to include four new customers, 
including Dansk Hestevæddeløb ApS, the joint 
operating company for horseracing and operator of all 
nine racetracks in Denmark. This is in addition to the 
long-standing contract we have with Danske Spil A/S, 
the national lottery in Denmark.
Racing and Digital also continued to enhance and 
promote its digital technologies, rolling-out key 
updates to the G4 white-label betting website 
product and deploying the Digital Link® mobile app, 
along with the self-service BetJet® SL 2.5 betting 
terminals at Ascot racecourse in the UK, under our 
contract with Betfred.
Looking forward
I see additional opportunities in both the North 
American and international markets, some of which 
have already come to fruition.
Since the start of the year, important new contracts 
and contract extensions have been signed in the tote 
services, global commingling, and digital services 
businesses.
Additional commingling agreements have already 
been completed with new customers in Europe: 
Norsk Rikstoto, the foundation that supervises pari-
mutuel betting on horseracing in Norway; and OPAP, 
the holder of exclusive rights to numerical lotteries 
and sports betting in Greece. These commingling 
contracts leverage the Quantum™ System software 
and European hosting and operations services to 
further expand the global commingling footprint and 
the menu of hosted pools and bet types.
A new ten-year, USD10 million agreement with 
Camarero Racetrack has been signed covering both 
Tote and Digital Services and including the provision 
of a new G4 wagering website and Digital Link®   
app to the exclusive operator of horseracing in  
Puerto Rico. 
Long-term Tote customer Parx® Racing once again 
selected Sportech for Tote services under a contract 
extension and also became a new Digital Services 
customer beginning in 2018 under a new five-year, 
USD4.1 million contract, using the G4 website and 
Digital Link® mobile products. Parx® Racing has a 
well-established intrastate account betting operation 
in Pennsylvania and this contract is a significant 
endorsement of Sportech’s digital technology 
platforms.
In North America, I am re-examining our Digital 
Services business with a focus on improving 
profitability and cash generation. We intend to push 
our digital technologies into racetrack and OTB 
operations in order to reduce capital and operational 
costs through the encouragement of “bring your own 
device” mobile apps and websites.
New products will be added to the Quantum™ 
System software including additional lottery products 
currently offered by LEIDSA, (a Sportech customer in 
the Dominican Republic), which would be suitable for 
deployment by other small private lottery operators, 
particularly in Latin America and Asia.

Bump 50:50
Description
The Bump 50:50 sports raffle business provides the 
technologies and services that allow the foundations 
(or charities) associated with professional and 
college sports teams and entertainment venues to 
sell and fulfil 50/50 raffles to generate funds for their 
charitable missions. Jackpots are divided equally 
between the foundation and the winner. Bump 50:50 
electronic raffle technologies and proven marketing 
strategies help foundations maximise the return 
on their charitable fundraising programs. Sportech 
acquired the business in 2014 when the company 
serviced just seven professional sports teams. Since 
then the determination and professional acumen of 
the team has seen our number of clients serviced 
grow to more than 60.
Financial performance
Revenues, currently included within the Racing and 
Digital division, were in 2017 up 46% at £1.2 million 
(2016: £0.8 million). Adjusted EBITDA £0.5 million 
(2016: £0.2 million). 
Developments
The Bump 50:50 business continued its multi-year 
growth trajectory in 2017, signing 25 new customers 
including the official charitable foundations of the 
Atlanta Braves (MLB®), Columbus Blue Jackets 
(NHL®), Houston Rockets (NBA®), Las Vegas 
Golden Knights (new franchise team of the NHL®), 
Pittsburgh Pirates (MLB®), New York Jets (NFL®), and 
the NASCAR Foundation. These additions helped 
bring the total number of Bump 50:50 customers 
to 68, representing foundations from 16 different 
professional and collegiate sports leagues. In 2017, 
Bump 50:50 helped their customer foundations raise 
just under US$11 million.
This year Bump 50:50 launched a new online and 
mobile raffle program to supplement in-stadia play 
and used this new platform to help the Tampa Bay 
Lightning Foundation reach a jackpot record of 
US$270,000 during the NHL® All-Star event.
In 2018, Bump 50:50 will continue its aggressive 
customer acquisition strategy, flexing staff up to 
accommodate additional deployments and to support 
increased sales activity. The company will target more 
non-sports customers – music and other large-scale 
community and entertainment festivals – for the 
online and mobile platforms in particular. The business 
continues to look at revenue enhancing vertical 
markets which may include internationalisation of the 
core product.
Venues

the State of Connecticut which has a population 
of 3.6 million, 76% of who are 18 and over, the legal 
age for pari-mutuel wagering there, and a median

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
white-label betting website technology and a mobile 
app powered by Sportech’s Digital Link® mobile, along 
with a traditional phone betting service featuring 
personal teller betting services.
Developments during the year
In 2017, Venues opened the 25,000 sq.ft. Bobby V’s 
Stamford, featuring 200 high definition TV’s, multi-
functional party spaces, an indoor golf simulator, and 
a designated betting area with VIP spaces and state-
of-the-art betting and viewing carrels in the heart 
of Stamford’s downtown district. Performance to 
date has been below the original expectations set by 
previous management, and we are reviewing growth 
initiatives for this venue, on both the wagering and 
food and beverage sides, including a comprehensive 
and aggressive plan for Group sales and food 
and beverage management, and more proactive 
deployment of mobile betting with Sportech’s  
Digital Link®.
The local management team successfully lobbied the 
Connecticut legislature for permission to open an 
additional six venues over and above the 18 we were 
already permitted to open, which will allow expansion 
and to eventually diversify into sports betting, should 
the laws and regulations be adjusted to permit it.
There remains illegal competition from unlicensed 
internet betting operators who accept wagers from 
Connecticut residents despite being issued cease and 
desist letters by the State’s Attorney General’s office. 
In 2017 and into 2018 we are pursuing new remedies 
available to us, including increased legal protections 
for Connecticut’s only licensed and taxed operator.
Despite this, our brand MyWinners.com achieved an 
11% increase in 2017 from online and mobile handle 
versus prior year. Regardless of the outcome of any 
remedial actions at the state level, the Board is taking 
a much more aggressive and proactive stance with 
regard to promotion and marketing of its digital 
channels. Sportech holds a distinct advantage in 
terms of both technology and access to bricks and 
mortar cross-selling and these advantages will be 
fully exploited to drive customer acquisition and to 
increase betting by customers who may hold multiple 
accounts.
The Venues division capitalises on its operational 
expertise to offer turn-key managed venue packages 
to licensed operators. In 2017, Venues extended 
key managed venue contracts with the Mohegan 
Sun Casino in Connecticut, along with two other 
racebooks in Louisiana and the Caribbean.
Corporate Management Structuring  
and Focus
With a shift in the senior management presence 
from the UK to North America, management 
operations from the Group’s existing London base 
will be relocating to the existing operations centres 
in Toronto and the US, where both I and a new CFO 
will be located. This shift will not only allow reduced 
corporate overhead costs but will also place senior 
corporate management in closer proximity to global 
technology and operational focal points, and the 
consumer-facing business, while maintaining key 
bases of operation and secondary business offices 
at existing locations in Bristol (UK), Ireland and 
Singapore.
Further financial focus will characterise senior 
management of Sportech going forward, with a 
renewed and vigorous focus on billing, debt collection, 
and working capital improvements within the business 
and a stricter financial evaluation of new business 
opportunities, capital investments, and partnerships.
2017 was a year of material change for Sportech 
and 2018 is shaping up to be one of significant 
opportunity. Global recurring service revenues in 
our B2B businesses provide a clear indication of 
growth resulting from several years of technology 
and operational investment. New contracts and 
sales opportunities in the 2018 pipeline speak to the 
efficacy of our technology and business strategy. The 
Bump 50:50 growth trajectory of the past four years 
is on pace to continue, with new sales platforms and 
opportunities in new markets. The Venues business 
now has room for meaningful strategic expansion 
and the tools to more aggressively compete in 
Connecticut’s digital marketplace. Finally, both our 
Venues and our Racing and Digital divisions are well 
positioned to act quickly and decisively on sports 
wagering, if and when the regulations allow it.
I am pleased to be leading Sportech and enthusiastic 
about what the future holds for its shareholders, 
customers and employees. Indeed, at this juncture I 
would like to thank all staff across the Group for their 
hard work and commitment.
