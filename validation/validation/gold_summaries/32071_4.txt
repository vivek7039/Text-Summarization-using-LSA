 At a Glance
PPG is a holding Company with subsidiaries and investments focused 
on the development and operation of flexible energy generation facilities, 
which play a crucial role in the changing UK energy mix as renewable 
generation replaces carbon intensive generation.
WHAT WE DO
Our 20MW ‘FlexGen’ sites – which can 
generate power within 30 seconds of 
being switched on remotely – provide 
a vital, low cost solution to assist in 
balancing the UK’s energy supply on a 
moment by moment basis. 
Since the introduction of intermittent, 
renewable power to the UK’s energy 
mix as legacy carbon intensive capacity 
is retired, the National Grid has faced 
increasing risks of brownouts and 
blackouts. UK power prices have seen 
recent peaks above £1,500 per MW 
hour due to outage and generation 
imbalances; there is therefore a need 
for a reliable source of power that can 
be accessed quickly and flexibly during 
periods when demand exceeds available 
supply. 
HOW WE OPERATE
Our facilities use established, reliable 
technology based on containerised 
generators, fired with renewable green 
fuel or gas – either mains or Liquidified 
Natural Gas (LNG).
Nine green fuel projects have been 
financed with a combination of debt and 
£35m of equity by Rockpool Investments 
LLP in individual companies established 
for this purpose. Plutus PowerGen has a 
44.5% stake in each company, and earns 
fees of £150,000 per site per year from 
management contracts. 
Other facilities, which will be gas-
powered, will be held in dedicated 
subsidiary companies as part of a non-
dilutive investment model in which we 
will seek to obtain a majority interest. We 
maintain complete flexibility in financing 
options for both the equity portion and 
the asset finance and maintain dialogue 
with many providers of finance. During 
the year we received an offer from a ‘Big 
Six’ multinational utility company to fund 
up to 20% of our flexible energy projects. 
Indeed, we have also just announced 
Heads of Terms agreement with JCB 
Power Products Broadcrown Limited, 
a part of the JCB Group, to provide, 
install, maintain and finance generators 
for existing and future projects, which 
may be through JCB Finance Limited or 
asset finance, where appropriate. JCB 
Finance Limited is part of the Royal Bank 
of Scotland Group plc.
Our model is built upon the ability to 
earn revenue from multiple markets for 
flexible power, as well as from secured 
management contracts read more on

• Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR)
• Firm Frequency Response (FFR)
• Triad
• Merchant power sales
• Capacity Market – on 15 year 
contracts
Finally, we have begun to develop battery 
projects through our partnership with 
London & Devonshire Trust (LDT), which 
represents c.80MW in our pipeline.
WHERE WE OPERATE
The projects in our pipeline are located in 
various regions of the UK. Our first site, in 
Plymouth, has traded successfully since 
it began operations in November 2016; 
a further eight renewable green diesel 
20MW projects and a further four 20MW 
gas projects are in various stages of 
development. Our unmanned generators 
are connected to the local, low voltage 
distribution network and are therefore 
classified as embedded generation.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Standalone FlexGen 
sites – green diesel 
powered
Our initial portfolio 
comprises nine Rockpool-
funded investee company 
sites (or 180MW). Focusing 
on these projects has 
allowed the Company to 
quickly establish a solid 
revenue and investment 
base. 
Standalone FlexGen 
sites – gas powered
To diversify our project 
portfolio, we have expanded 
our activities into gas 
powered generators, using 
both mains gas as well 
as LNG, which provides 
locational flexibility. These 
projects will allow us to take 
advantage of new markets 
and the anticipated power 
price volatility, as they are 
able to run for longer hours 
at a lower strike price.
Co-located SolarFlex 
sites
One of our strategic 
priorities is to establish 
SolarFlex sites, where 
our generators are co-
located – and share grid 
connections – with solar 
farms. The technologies are 
highly complementary, since 
our generators would use 
the connections when not 
required by the solar farms, 
and would therefore allow 
greater utilisation of the 
connections. By providing 
an additional return to the 
solar farm operators, we 
would help to accelerate 
the development of solar 
farms without the need for 
subsidy.
Battery Sites
These will generally be 
stand-alone but may be 
used in conjunction with 
Gas or SolarFlex and 
our stand-alone battery 
projects are currently being 
developed in partnership 
with LDT.
OUR PIPELINE
We have a total pipeline of over 700MW, and will have 120MW of capacity in operation for this 
winter with a further 140MW at the post-planning stage by the end of 2017.
We aim to develop the following types of projects, and are actively working with a company 
to explore ‘front-ending’ each site using exhaustible (i.e. non-firm) power from batteries or 
capacitors to allow us to compete in additional balancing markets as well as be more price 
competitive in existing markets:
