An online department store, offering 
style for 50-plus customers and their 
families, with ranges for women, men, 
home and kids. We create unique 
silhouettes, rather than scaling 
patterns; we use real bodies, rather 
than static mannequins; and we design 
to fit – a unique, age appropriate  
point of view for our consumer.

We are structured in a matrix approach, 
buying by product category and 
marketing by brand. This allows us to 
run a portfolio of brands effectively 
and efficiently. All of our brands sell 
a wide range of clothing and 
homewares products.
Our three Power Brands are our growth 
engines; here we aim to gain new 
customers and grow market share. Our 
Secondary Brands are also in growing 
markets, however they are more niche 
and we therefore aim to grow share of 
existing customer spend. Our Traditional 
Segment is in a slowly declining market; 
our objective here is to grow market share 
and hold this segment broadly flat over 
the medium term. 
Our Financial Services business operates 
across all brands, with the younger brands 
typically having a higher penetration of 
sales sold through credit.

Secondary Brands focus on distinct 
customer niches which are not served 
by our Power Brands. These brands 
have significant customer loyalty, good 
growth prospects and are increasingly 
online. We view our Power Brands as 
having the greatest growth potential 
medium term, however, and therefore 
our focus here is predominantly on our 
existing customers.

The titles in this segment are focused 
on serving our loyal, traditional and 
typically more mature customers. 
These customers tend to prefer 
paper-based marketing, such as 
catalogues and direct-mail offers.  
This is an attractive and accessible 
market, underserved by other retailers, 
and whilst not a future growth driver 
we generate a good financial return.

An important part of our overall 
proposition, strengthening customer 
loyalty and enabling our retail business 
to thrive. In order to offer our 
customers excellent convenience and 
choice, we allow customers to either 
pay us immediately or utilise a credit 
account for their purchases, spreading 
the cost of their purchases over time.
