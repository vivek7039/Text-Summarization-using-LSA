 Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 02
Chairman’s statement
Financial results
The Group’s reported revenue for the year ended 
31 March 2017 was £141.6 million, in line with that reported 
in the previous year. The reported profit before tax improved 
to £8.8 million, compared with a loss of £0.3 million in the 
previous year and a loss of £6.1 million in the year before 
that. The positive direction of travel is clear, as is the success 
of our programme of cost control. 
Funds under Management and Administration stood at 
£24.0 billion at the year-end, compared with £20.5 billion  
the year before, an increase of 17.1%. This mirrors the 
improvement in the market index that we track, though 
the increase in Discretionary funds was significantly ahead 
of this over the 12-month period, up from £9.4 billion to 
£11.4 billion, or 21.3%. 
Our cash position remains strong, at £58.4 million compared 
with £48.4 million at the previous year-end (both years are 
inclusive of cash balances held within assets held for sale). 
Remuneration structures
It is pleasing to report that by the year-end we had 
substantially completed our major project of restructuring 
the remuneration arrangements of our investment managers. 
The Board has been closely involved in the remuneration 
project, as I described in my statement last year, and I 
should like to thank all of our investment managers for their 
help and support in bringing this exercise to a successful 
completion. As a consequence we have greater alignment 
with the strategy of the business and better regulatory 
outcomes – for example the incentive structures in 
Investment Management Services and Financial Planning 
are no longer purely financial but are also linked directly 
to standards of conduct. Throughout, the interests of our 
clients have always been, and remain, uppermost. The high 
score of 93% overall client satisfaction achieved in this year’s 
surveys are testament to this.
On page 4 of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
Paul Abberley, addresses in greater detail our strategic 
development and implementation. 
Governance review
During the year, considerable work has been carried out 
reviewing our corporate governance framework. We have 
restructured the relationship between our two principal 
boards – Charles Stanley Group PLC (the holding company, 
or CSG) and Charles Stanley & Co. Limited (the principal 
regulated entity, or CSC) – and reorganised the committee 
arrangements. More senior managers have joined the 
Executive Committee, chaired by Paul Abberley, which not 
only develops and implements strategy as agreed by the 
CSG Board, but also manages the business on a day-to-day 
basis. More detail of the new governance framework is set 
out in the Governance section on pages 46 to 97. 
Sir David Howard
Chairman
2017 has been another year of 
significant transformation for the 
Group and we have made good 
progress against our articulated 
strategy. It is pleasing to announce 
that the transformation programme 
is bearing fruit, with sustained 
revenues despite the disposal of 
non-core activities last year, and 
a welcome return to profitability.

Board changes
David Pusinelli has decided not to put his name forward for 
re-election as a Non-executive Director at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. David has been a highly valued 
member of the team, and has managed his roles as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and as Senior Independent Director 
with skill and effectiveness. David joined the Board in 2012 
and has contributed significantly to the progress of the 
Group. The Board thanks him sincerely for his help and 
advice, and wishes him good health and a long retirement. 
A search is well advanced for additional Non-executive 
Directors, with the guidance of professional external 
consultants, and we hope to make an announcement 
to shareholders in the near future. 
Turning to our Executive Directors, it was to our regret that 
Michael Lilwall advised us in the autumn of his wish to step 
down from the Board for personal reasons. Michael joined 
Charles Stanley in 1997 and has played a significant role in 
many of our developments since that time. We are delighted 
that, though no longer a Director, he remains with the Group 
and will continue to look after a number of valued clients.
In last year’s report I referred to the resignation, just after 
the year-end, of Anthony Scott. Anthony was a Director 
and the co-head of the Investment Management Services 
division, which represents the great majority of our business. 
To both Michael and Anthony I express the warmest thanks 
on behalf of the Group for their substantial contribution.
Our team
Throughout a very busy year our staff have worked tirelessly 
to look after our clients, demonstrating our core values of 
being Caring, Fair and Progressive. So it gives me great 
pleasure to announce that the annual staff engagement 
survey carried out in November 2016 showed a sharp 11% 
increase in the overall engagement score to 67%. This 
illustrates that our staff are taking an active and engaged 
approach to our significant programme of improvement.
I would also like to pay tribute on behalf of the Board to the 
considerable achievements of our CEO, Paul Abberley, in 
masterminding the transformation process that is under 
way. He has led from the front and carried us all with him, 
embodying our theme of ‘One Charles Stanley’. He has been 
ably supported by Ben Money-Coutts, our Chief Financial 
Officer, and Gary Teper, the Head of our Investment 
Management Services division. Our Non-executive Directors 
have also had a very busy and challenging year and have 
contributed greatly. I also thank our shareholders for their 
continuous support. 
Dividend
I have previously outlined our policy to return to a pattern 
of steadily increasing dividends once profitability starts to 
improve significantly. The Board is therefore recommending 
a final dividend of 4.5 pence per share. Taken together with 
the interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share, this results in a 
total dividend for the year of 6.0 pence per share, an increase 
of 20% compared to 5.0 pence per share paid in the prior year.
Outlook
The two principal external drivers of our growth – the level of 
markets and the volume of investment trading – both surged 
after the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016 and have remained 
buoyant ever since. Much of the uncertainty which I spoke 
of last year has now dissipated with the EU referendum 
result and the election of President Trump, but we now have 
further uncertainty over the shape of the UK government 
following the UK election on 8 June 2017. 
Looking further ahead, the macro uncertainties remain as 
great as ever. There is a lot of focus on what the UK’s exit 
from the EU will mean for the UK financial services industry. 
Our business, being predominantly UK-based and serving 
UK-based clients, is, we believe, relatively well placed to ride 
out any storm that might arise for the financial services 
sector from the Brexit negotiations. 
Despite these longer term uncertainties, market conditions 
are more settled, and more favourable, than they were at 
this time last year. This provides a favourable backdrop for 
our transformation programme and should bring growth in 
revenues, profits and margins, which in turn will support our 
progressive dividend policy and thus generate long-term 
shareholder value.
