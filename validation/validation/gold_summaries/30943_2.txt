OUR
KEY
STRENGTHS
Established international brand  
with an extensive audience reach: 
Time Out is one of the leading brands to inspire and 
enable people through curated content about how 
to enjoy food, drink, culture, art, travel and entertainment in 
cities around the world. The Directors believe that the Group’s 
established brand – which launched in 1968 – and high brand 
awareness are key drivers of Time Out’s significant average global 
monthly audience reach of 217 million, and that this will help 
drive consumer traffic to the Group’s trusted digital platform and 
give users the confidence to execute e-commerce transactions.
1
Attractive unit economics driven by significant 
consumer demand for the Group’s independent, 
inspirational and curated content: 
The Directors believe that the Group’s average global 
monthly audience reach of approximately 217 million lowers 
the marketing cost of acquiring users and makes it easier to 
transition users from content consumption to e-commerce. In the 
context of its increasing audience reach, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well-placed to continue to benefit from attractive 
unit economics, the reach it can obtain on social media platforms 
and the growth of its digital presence.
4
Strong relationships with brand and local 
advertising partners and sophisticated model 
for generating advertising revenue:
The Group has established long-term, direct 
relationships with global brands and local businesses and uses 
a number of solution-based advertising platforms, programmatic 
platforms and other creative channels, including native 
advertising, experiential advertising and multi-channel campaigns 
to generate advertising revenue.
2
Worldwide roll-out of Time Out Market:
The first Time Out Market in Lisbon received 
approximately 1.9 million visitors in 2015, 3.1 million 
in 2016 and 3.6 million in 2017. It achieved positive 
EBITDA within 18 months of opening. The Directors believe 
that the Lisbon market format presents a scalable opportunity 
that can be replicated in other cities, expanding the Group’s 
international presence and raising the profile of the Time Out 
brand.
5
Diverse content distribution network including 
technology with multi-channel scalability potential: 
The Directors believe that the scalable and flexible 
architecture of the Group’s digital platform will allow it 
to develop ongoing improvements in functionality and expand to 
address new business opportunities.
3
Experienced management team: 
The Group has an experienced management team with 
a strong background in digital media, e-commerce and 
technology businesses as well as retail and hospitality.
6
Detailed and growing user data: 
The Group’s digital platforms, Flypay technology and 
free Wi-Fi in the Time Out Market in Lisbon will provide 
the Group with a source of valuable, high-quality user 
data and information which the Group can leverage in order to 
increase its revenue from e-commerce.
