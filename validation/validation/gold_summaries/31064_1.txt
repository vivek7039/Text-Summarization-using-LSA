Growth in our dCELL
®
 Technology 
product portfolio was underpinned by a 
46% increase in DermaPure
®
 sales. With 
its first full year of sales, controlled joint 
venture GBM-V increased revenue by 8 
fold to £1.1m. The contribution of CellRight 
Technologies acquired on 9 August 2017, 
included in the year end figure means we 
have increased overall Group revenue to 
over £5m.
Alongside the acquisition of CellRight 
Technologies we have commenced a review 
of the enlarged Group’s product pipeline 
and opportunities to establish the best 
strategy to drive the Group forward.

TRX BioSurgery 
(previous Tissue Regenix Wound Care, Inc)
DermaPure
®
 has proven successful in a 
number of clinical applications outside 
of the traditional advanced wound care 
settings. With adoption by the acute surgical 
and wound reconstruction markets, due 
to its impressive clinical outcomes with a 
single application, DermaPure
®
 has seen 
significant uptake in the orthopaedic trauma 
and urogynaecology arenas where treatment 
innovation has been in high demand. 
Having identified an opportunity in this 
market, we have signed an exclusive 
distributor agreement with ARMS Medical, a 
specialist urogynaecology distributor in the 
United States to maximise this opportunity, 
leveraging their strong relationships with 
KOLs and surgeons. The partnership  
allows our direct sales force to remain 
focussed on the in-patient woundcare, 
plastics, orthopaedics and general surgery 
sales channels. 
Alongside this, the addition of CellRight’s 
advanced wound care products give the 
Group a wide product portfolio in this field, 
offering physicians access to DermaPure
®
, 
a room temperature stable, decellularized 
single application allograft, Matrix IQ, a frozen 
or freeze dried decellularised allograft, and 
AmnioWorks, derived from amniotic tissue.
Following the end of the period, Tissue 
Regenix Wound Care Inc. was rebranded as 
TRX BioSurgery.

 Orthopaedics 
Changes to Medical Device Regulations 
have extended the timeline to receive 
CE mark approval for OrthoPure™ XT 
(xenograft tendon) within the EU. However, 
this has resulted in the opportunity to submit 
an extension to this application to include 
other ligament indications accelerating the 
broadening of the commercial opportunity. 
Subject to approval, this would allow 
OrthoPure™ XT to be utilised not only in 
primary and revision ACL reconstruction, 
but also procedures in small ligaments in the 
knee, expanding utilisation and broadening 
our label claims. We have commenced 
pre-launch activities and have engaged 
European distributors in selective key 
markets to facilitate a timely roll-out once 
country registrations have been received.
The OrthoPure™ XT clinical data collected 
at one year showed the implant to be 
comparable, and in some indications 
preferable, to the current gold standard 
treatment, an autograft harvested from 
the hamstring, and without the additional 
rehabilitation of an autograft procedure. 
This clinical data has also been used to 
validate the potential for a pre-clinical trial 
in the US. As reported previously, we have 
been in discussions with the FDA and it 
is expected that this pre-clinical work will 
commence during 2018 with the support of 
our Orthopaedic Clinical Advisory Board. 
The technology transfer for the production 
of OrthoPure™ HT (allograft ligament), at 
the CellRight facility continues according 
to plan and we expect the first product 
to be available in H2 2018. As this is a 
human tissue derived application, it can be 
approved under the HCT/P pathway for 
minimally manipulated tissue thus expediting 
the time to market. This would serve as a 
pathfinder validating the dCELL
®
 Technology 
within the US Orthopaedic market.

Cardiac and GBM-V
The regulatory submission for CardioPure™ 
dCELL
®
 allograft pulmonary and aortic heart 
valves continues to progress through the 
German regulatory authorities. The clinical 
data generated by Dr Francisco da Costa, 
our clinician partner in Brazil, continues  
to demonstrate the clinical relevance  
and advantages of these transplants even  
after more than 10 years of follow-up. 
Subject to the regulatory process we 
anticipate that approval will be received  
for launch during 2019. 
In addition to the preparation and 
commercialisation of CardioPure™, the 
controlled joint venture in Germany has 
captured a 12%
1
 market share in its first 
year of operations with processed corneas. 
We expect to release further cryo-preserved 
tissues throughout the year.

Orthopaedics and Dental -
CellRight Technologies
CellRight Technologies officially became  
a part of the Tissue Regenix Group in 
August 2017. 
Based around a proprietary processing 
technology ‘BioRinse
®
’, CellRight 
produces a portfolio of inductive, verified 
bone matrices in different physical forms 
to address clinical indications in the 
orthopaedic, spine, dental and general 
surgery procedures. 
BioRinse
®
 offers a complementary platform 
Technology to dCELL
®
, allowing the Group 
to address regenerative solutions for both 
soft tissue and bone. 
DentalFix
®
, a portfolio of traditional as well 
as innovative dental biologics validated as 
being osteoinductive, was launched. The 
dental market is an area in which we see a 
significant opportunity for the Group with 
both dCELL
®
 and BioRinse
®
 products, 
and currently comprises around 20% of 
CellRight sales. 
CellRight has reached several milestones 
since the completion of the acquisition. In 
October they commenced the production 
of AmnioWorks
®
, an advanced wound 
care product derived from human amniotic 
membrane. Alongside this, additional sizes 
of their frozen and freeze dried wound care 
product Matrix IQ were released to address 
larger surgical site procedures. 
With no direct sales force, CellRight based 
their business model around establishing 
strategic partnerships for distribution of 
both their white label (OEM) as well as 
branded products. These partnerships have 
continued to gain traction and we expect 
to see further partnerships develop in the 
coming year.
CellRight delivered on their revenue 
expectations during 2017 and we continue 
to see increasing commercial traction and 
momentum. We expect to report positive 
advances with the CellRight portfolio  
during 2018.

Integration
The integration process has continued to 
progress according to plan and we expect 
the initial commercial and financial synergies 
to materialise in H1 2018.
The technology transfer for DermaPure
®
 
production has been initiated. The 
completion of residual DNA testing returned 
positive results, demonstrating over 99% 
removal of DNA from the tissue. We expect 
that this process will complete ahead of 
schedule with our first CellRight-processed 
DermaPure
®
 becoming available during H1 
2018. Having our own in-house source of 
DermaPure
®
 manufactured in the US, for 
the US market, will support supply from our 
relationship with CTS, removing the risk of 
single sourcing and ensuring that our product 
inventory can align with customer demand.
In October, the Tissue Regenix Wound Care 
office, also based in San Antonio, TX, moved 
into the CellRight facility, allowing all US 
operations to be centralised in one location. 
A shared services infrastructure has been 
implemented and the advantages of a cross-
selling distribution and partnership network 
are beginning to be realised.

08 Post Period Developments 
Following the reported period, the Group 
reached a number of regulatory and 
commercial milestones which will play an 
important part in the strategy and commercial 
success of the Group moving forward. 
Fundamental to this was the announcement 
of a long-term, multi-year distribution 
agreement with Arthrex, Inc. for CellRight’s 
osteobiologic products. Arthrex is one of the 
world’s leading sports medicine businesses 
and a premier innovator of orthopaedic 
surgical solutions. This is the first agreement 
of this nature to be signed since completing 
the acquisition and paves the way for the 
Group to pursue relationships with other 
strategic partners. 
In order to expedite a route to market in 
Europe for the CellRight products Tissue 
Regenix applied for a Human Tissue 
Authority licence and we expect this to 
be granted imminently, allowing for the 
import of CellRight’s osteobiologics to the 
manufacturing facility in Leeds for direct 
distribution. It is expected that the first  
sales under this approval will commence 
in H2 2018.
Further to this, initial manufacturing for 
commercial distribution of SurgiPure
™
 XD 
has begun at the Leeds facility for export 
to the US where it is approved under the 
510(k) market clearance pathway. We are 
in discussions with potential partners to 
determine the optimal route to market. 
Outlook
The Group has reached a significant 
inflection point in terms of its development 
as a commercial entity. Having successfully 
completed the acquisition and integration 
of CellRight Technologies we now have 
two complementary and highly valuable 
regenerative technology platforms and  
a comprehensive product portfolio.  
Looking forward, we have a diverse 
distribution network, a strengthened 
commercial management team and 
significant opportunities to increase our 
commercial footprint both in the US, and 
international markets.
The Group is well positioned for future 
growth with a clearly defined strategy, strong 
leadership and a robust product portfolio 
and pipeline. The CellRight acquisition 
allows for acceleration of our route to 
market specifically for the dCELL
®
 business, 
and offers an enhanced product portfolio, 
which strengthens our ability to increase 
our market adoption and penetration. 
This was demonstrated during Q1 2018 
where we announced strategic distribution 
agreements with ARMS Medical, a specialist 
urogynaecology distributor for DermaPure
®
, 
and Arthrex, Inc. a world leader in 
orthopaedic sports medicine. 
We are grateful for the continued support 
of our shareholders throughout the year. 
Their commitment enables us to continue 
to advance the strategic vision of the 
Group which we are confident will create 
significant value as we accelerate the 
commercialisation of our product portfolio.
Sales in both CellRight and BioSurgery have 
had a strong start to the year, including 
shipments under two significant distributor 
agreements. With the recent launch of 
the CellRight DentalFix portfolio and 
AmnioWorks product, the approval of the 
OrthoPure™ XT CE mark and additional 
BioSurgery product line extensions 
expected to come on stream throughout the 
year, 2018 is set to be a year of significant 
newsflow, increasing commercial traction 
and revenue growth. 
Trading for 2018 remains in line with  
Board expectations.
