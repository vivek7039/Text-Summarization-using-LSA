Highlights
Financial
 > Strong revenue growth of 19.8% 
(14.5% at constant currency):
 > organic revenue growth of 7.3% 
(2.1% at constant currency); and
 > inorganic revenue growth of 12.5% 
(12.4% at constant currency).
 > Adjusted operating profit increased by 9.6% to 
£35.6 million (4.2% at constant currency). 
 > As anticipated, adjusted operating profit margin 
declined by 1.7 percentage points, partly as a 
consequence of new acquisitions.
 > Reported profit before tax declined by 2.5% 
to £17.9 million (2016: £18.4 million), resulting 
predominantly from the increased amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets and a movement 
in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.

at £35.9 million (2016: £31.1 million).
 > Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.9x after 
two acquisitions completed in the year.

Strategic
 > Two acquisitions completed during the year, 
strengthening our position in existing geographies, 
with all integration activity for recent acquisitions 
progressing well.
 > Acquisition of Breathing Buildings Limited 
completed in December 2016. Breathing Buildings 
has been pioneering natural and hybrid ventilation 
systems since 2006, with which it has become 
very successful within the new build education 
sector. The acquisition has widened our capability 
with a leader in natural and hybrid ventilation for 
commercial buildings, strengthened our product 
range and broadened our channel to market.
 > Acquisition of VoltAir System AB completed in 
May 2017. VoltAir System has a strong presence in 
the residential and commercial new build ventilation 
markets in Sweden in the growing market for 
energy‑efficient air handling units. The business 
is highly complementary to our strong position 
in the Nordic residential refurbishment ventilation 
products market. 
 > OEM (Torin‑ Sifan) launched its new high‑ efficiency 
Revolution 360 range of EC fans into volume 
production during the year, which offers benefits in 
both high efficiency and low noise to the European 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry.
Strong revenue growth of 20% 
and adjusted EPS up 8%.
Recent acquisitions integrating well, 
supplementing continued organic growth. Strategic Report
