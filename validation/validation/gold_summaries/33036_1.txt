 We live in an era of greater customer
choice than we have ever seen before. This
choice is good for customers and good for
our industry.
Changes in technology are leading to changes in
people’s behaviour. People are, for example, spending
more time on the internet and sending information by
e-mail, where once they would have used the phone or
fax.
This transformation is putting converged services
at the heart of our offering, enabling our customers to
communicate wherever they happen to be.
As we move from a narrowband to a broadband
world, we are offering a new mix of products and
services in new markets – ICT, broadband, mobility
and managed services.
‘‘Technology substitution’’ is also having a
signiﬁcant impact in our traditional voice markets,
where ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed voice revenues were down in both
the consumer and business markets.
This is both a challenge and an opportunity. We
have to respond to those changes in technology, the
market and behaviour, at the same time as working to
accelerate them.
We have to be absolutely focused on defending
and reinventing our traditional markets, through
imaginative sales and marketing, through delivering
the right products at the right prices. And we have to
follow our customers where they want to go, offering
them new, ﬂexible services that match their changing
personal and business needs.
Customer satisfaction
Our passion for customers is at the heart of everything
we do.
A year ago we launched our brand promise to
make every customer experience ‘‘simple and
complete.’’ This is essential to driving down customer
dissatisfaction, which remains a critical goal for us. In
the 2004 ﬁnancial year, we reduced dissatisfaction by
22%.
As customer dissatisfaction is driven down, so is
the cost of failure. A great customer experience – and
cost savings – really can be two sides of the same coin.
Getting things right for customers the ﬁrst time keeps
them loyal, contributes to cost effectiveness, and
boosts our reputation.
New wave business
ICT used to be an aspiration; it’s now a reality. We had
a superb year with ICT orders worth more than
£7 billion – up 59% on just a year ago. The three deals
we signed with the NHS, for example – expected to be
worth more than £2.1 billion – indicate our strength in
this market.
I believe that we have something very special to
offer – the ability to act as ‘‘the telco inside’’ our
customers’ organisations. We offer our customers –
businesses and other large organisations, including
local and national government – the chance to enhance
their productivity, through expert management of their
information systems, desktop to desktop.
And we have a full range of network-centric ICT
solutions depending on what our customers want –
from full service assurance across their ICT
infrastructure, through monitoring levels of service
throughout their operations, to validation of their
networks, data centres and desktops.
Broadband
It’s been a tremendous year for broadband as well.
People were sceptical when we said we’d reach two
million DSL wholesale lines by the summer of 2004.
What nobody expected was that we would achieve two
million in February 2004. As at 14 May 2004, we had
2.45 million – and climbing. The UK is now moving
towards the top of the broadband league.
And our programme for upgrading our exchanges
to broadband has been extremely effective in bringing
the beneﬁts of this amazing technology to some of the
remoter parts of the UK. In April 2004, we announced
a roll-out plan that will bring broadband to 99.6% of
the UK’s homes and businesses.
The announcement, in May 2004, that we will
redesign and reduce the cost of our local loop
unbundling product, should encourage investment in
broadband infrastructure and promote innovation. It’s
a major move towards the telecommunications market
of the future.
In the consumer broadband market we’ve teamed
up with Yahoo! to offer compelling, world-class content
and launched a suite of new products that will enable
customers to get the most from broadband. A couple
of years ago we were among the ﬁrst to offer a
broadband connection for less than £30 a month. This
year we’ve broken the £20 barrier, with an entry-level
broadband product for just £19.99 a month.
Mobility
We also stepped back into the consumer mobility
market with BT Mobile Home Plan and we established
the high street presence that will enable us to offer
converged products and services in the future.
Again, our goal is to offer communications
ﬂexibility, enabling our customers to communicate the
information they choose, in the way that they choose,
using whatever communications device they choose.
In May 2004, we announced that we will be
working with Vodafone UK to dismantle the barriers
between ﬁxed and mobile services, by offering fully
converged, ﬁxed/mobile services in the business and
Chief Executive’s statement
4 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 consumer mobile markets. Our customers will beneﬁt
from being able to communicate and access the same
information and services however and wherever they
want; whether they are connected to a ﬁxed network
or on the move.
For our larger business customers we also offer
convergence, managing their ﬁxed and mobile
communications seamlessly.
And the growth of Wi-Fi (wireless broadband)
suggests that it could well be one of those
technologies which rapidly becomes a part of our
customers’ lives. Once they’ve experienced it, they
ﬁnd it hard to imagine life without it.
Traditional business
Given the impact of new technology and increasing
competition, voice call volumes may no longer be the
absolute guide to the health of the company that they
once were, but they remain a fundamental part of our
business and we are bringing an innovative approach
to product development, sales and marketing in the
voice calls business. Robust defence doesn’t mean
retreat, it means seizing new opportunities.
BT Together, for example, has been a major
success with around nine million customers. During the
year, we announced that we will be abolishing the
standard rate for our existing customers from 1 July
2004, and launched an enhanced range of option
packages. In the business calls market BT Business
Plan has had similar success – customer numbers were
up from 20,000 to 175,000 in the year. And BT Local
Business is demonstrating that getting close to our
customers can deliver signiﬁcant revenue beneﬁts.
Cost leadership
Cost leadership is vital to the accelerating
transformation of BT.
We can and must operate as efﬁciently and
effectively as possible, benchmarking our costs against
those of other European telecommunications
companies. Most recently, these comparisons showed
that our costs are better than average for large
telecommunications companies but that we still have
some way to go to achieve best-in-class costs.
In the last three years, we’ve made major reductions in
the costs of our operations and we’ve identiﬁed a
further £1 billion that can be achieved.
Our Hands Off Access Network (HOAN) project,
for example, is helping to improve network efﬁciency
by minimising manual network intervention and
reducing the need for exchange visits.
This is not about cutting corners or compromising
on service, but about ﬁnding innovative, cost-effective
new ways to meet customers’ needs.
And, over the next few years, we’ll be creating the
21st century network. We are transforming our
networks, converging them on to a modern, single,
multi-purpose platform that will enable us to reduce
costs, meet customers’ changing needs and improve
customer satisfaction. The 21st century network will
offer higher performance in return for lower operating
costs.
Our people
Of course, without the commitment and hard work of
BT people, our strategy would be nothing more than
words on the page.
A year ago, we introduced our new values –
trustworthy, helpful, inspiring, straightforward, heart.
Since then, our people have translated those values
into action, driving down customer dissatisfaction,
defending the traditional business and winning
business in new markets.
We’re very proud of what they’ve done and of
what they are continuing to do.
