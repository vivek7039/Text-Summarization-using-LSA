Cardiovascular Infection Gastrointestinal
Our primary focus is the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription 
medicines for six important areas of healthcare: Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal, Infection, 
Neuroscience, Oncology and Respiratory & Inﬂammation. 
We operate in over 100 countries and our innovative medicines are used by millions  
of patients worldwide. We are one of only a handful of companies to span the entire 
life-cycle of a medicine from discovery, early and late-stage development, to the global 
commercialisation of primary care, specialty care-led and specialty care medicines. Using 
these skills and capabilities we can make a real difference to the health of a broad range of 
patients by delivering great medicines in disease areas where there is unmet medical need.
We want AstraZeneca to be valued as a source of great medicines and trusted as a 
company that delivers business success responsibly. Our Responsible Business Plan 
provides the framework for ensuring that we operate with integrity and high ethical 
standards across all our activities.

>  84 pipeline projects 
including 71 in clinical 
development, of which  
11 are in Phase III or 
under regulatory review;  
19 withdrawn during 
the year
 > Brilinta/Brilique has 
been approved in 88 
countries, launched  
in 82 countries and 
remains under review  
in 23 countries.  
Global sales of  
$89 million in 2012
>    Core R&D expense for 
the full year was down 
11%, despite absorbing 
higher costs from 
spending on in-licensed, 
acquired or partnered 
projects, as these were 
more than offset by 
restructuring beneﬁts 
and lower intangible 
impairments than  
in 2011
>  Revenue fell by 21% in 
the US; 19% in Western 
Europe; and 14% in 
Established Rest of 
World. Revenue rose by 
4% in Emerging Markets
>  Some $4.5 billion of 
revenue decline was 
related to loss of 
exclusivity on several 
brands in the portfolio. 
Seroquel IR declined  
by more than $3 billion; 
regional losses of 
exclusivity for Atacand, 
Nexium and Crestor  
had a further negative 
impact of more than  
$1 billion

SG&A were 12% lower 
than 2011, a result of
