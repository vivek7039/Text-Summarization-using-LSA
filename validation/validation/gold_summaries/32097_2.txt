About our non-GAAP measures and why we use them
Throughout this report we refer to underlying results and measures. The underlying measures allow 
management and other stakeholders to better compare the performance of the Group between the 
current and prior period without the effects of one-off or non-operational items.
Underlying measures exclude certain one-off items such as those arising due to restructuring activities and 
recurring non-operational items, including certain intangible amortisation.
Exceptional items are explained on page 115 and Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are 
included on page 25.
