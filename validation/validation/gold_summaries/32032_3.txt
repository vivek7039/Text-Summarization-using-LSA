Chairman’s statement
Progressing towards ambitious goals
“I am delighted to report another year of growth, 
driven by a strong flow of organic new business”
Joanne Lake
Non-Executive Chairman
This is my first statement to shareholders 
since being appointed as the Group’s 
new Chairman at our Annual General 
Meeting in October 2016. On behalf of all 
of my colleagues, I would like to thank my 
predecessor and co-founder of Mattioli 
Woods, Bob Woods, for his immense 
contribution in building our business  
into one of the UK’s leading providers  
of wealth management and employee 
benefit services. 
Review of the year
I am delighted to report another year of 
growth, driven by a strong flow of organic 
new business and continued demand for 
advice from clients, which together with 
acquisitions completed in this and the prior 
financial year has seen the Group achieve a 
significant milestone in generating annual 
revenues of over £50m. 
We have enjoyed further growth in our 
investment and asset management 
business, with gross discretionary assets 
under management
4
 (“AuM”) increasing 
by £460m during the year, with £190m of 
new monies invested in our discretionary 
portfolio management service. The Mattioli 
Woods Structured Products Fund was 
launched in November 2016 and its value 
now exceeds £100m. Custodian REIT, the 
UK real estate investment trust managed 
by our subsidiary Custodian Capital, raised 
£76m of new monies during the year 
and now has a market capitalisation of 
almost £400m. 
One of our stated aims is to lower the 
cost of the range of services we provide 
to clients, while growing a long-term 
sustainable business. We were delighted 
to reduce the custody charge for all those 
clients using our core investment platform 
from 1 August 2017, which followed our 
previous announcement that the terms of 
the Investment Management Agreement 
between Custodian Capital and Custodian 
REIT have been amended to secure both 
a cost reduction for investors in Custodian 
REIT and an important long-term revenue 
stream for the Group.
Organic revenue growth of 11.6% 
(2016: 8.5%) or £4.4m was driven by 
our largely home-grown consultancy 
team, further accelerated by growth in 
our investment and asset management 
and property businesses. We continue 
to see demand for advice from clients, 
driven by lifestyle, increasing longevity, 
tax and other legislative changes, 
including the pension freedoms that 
introduced a major shift in how people 
can access their pensions, which in turn 
has driven further growth in pension 
consultancy and administration revenues. 
Acquisitions continue to be a core part 
of our growth strategy. Our purchase of 
49% of Amati Global Investors Limited 
(“Amati”), which we announced in 
February, is an exciting extension to our 
asset management business. Amati’s 
total AuM has increased from £120m 
at acquisition to over £178m today. 
In September 2016 we were pleased 
to announce the acquisition of MC 
Trustees, which is an excellent fit with 
our existing pension business and has 
contributed positively to the Group’s 
trading result for the year . We believe 
further consolidation within our core 
markets remains likely and our strong 
balance sheet gives us the flexibility to 
make further value-enhancing acquisitions. 
Strong revenue growth in the year 
translated into growth in Adjusted EPS 
of 11.4% to 34.1p (2016: 30.6p). We are 
proud of the strong shareholder returns 
we have delivered and remain committed 
to growing the dividend, while maintaining 
an appropriate level of dividend cover . 
Accordingly, the Board is pleased to 
recommend the payment of an increased 
final dividend of 9.4p per share (2016: 
8.65 p). This makes a proposed total 
dividend for the year of 14.1p (2016: 12.5p), 
a year-on-year increase of 12.8%. 
4 Excludes assets under management by Amati Global 
Investors Limited.
