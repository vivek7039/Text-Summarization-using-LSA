Chief Executive’s statement
Reflecting the Group’s strong trading performance, the Board is pleased 
to recommend a 21.7% increase in the final dividend
We have strengthened 
our market-leading portfolio
Summary 
Building on the performance of 2016, Safestore has delivered another strong 
financial result through a combination of organic and acquisitive growth and 
the debt refinancing in May 2017 . Total Group revenue increased by 12.6% 
(10.0% at CER
1
) with a strong performance across the UK (+11.6%) and 
continued strength in Paris (+5.1%). On a like-for-like basis
2
 in CER, Group 
revenue increased by 3.3% with the UK up 3.1% and Paris up 4.0%. 
The Group’s like-for-like closing occupancy increased by 1.3 percentage 
points (“ppts”) to 75.0% with the average storage rate up 1.3% at CER. 
Our operational performance across the UK has been robust this year. 
Our updated consumer website, combined with our digital marketing 
expertise, delivered good enquiry growth, which has resulted in like-for-like 
closing occupancy in the UK growing by 0.6ppts to 72.5%. Growth 
in occupancy in the UK regions outside London and the South East 
performed particularly well. 
ln the UK, we successfully integrated the Space Maker portfolio during the 
year and completed the acquisition of the twelve-store Alligator Self Storage 
portfolio on 1 November 2017 for £56 million
3
. In addition, the four new 
stores opened in London – Chiswick, London – Wandsworth, Birmingham 
and Altrincham, on time and on budget, between August and November 
2016 are all performing in line with or ahead of their business plans. 
In Paris, our performance has been robust with like-for-like revenue growing 
by 4.0%. Our balanced approach to revenue management resulted in 
like-for-like rate growth of 2.3% and average occupancy growth of 1.2%. 
Like-for -like closing occupancy ended the year at 84.7% (FY2016: 80.7%). 
This is the nineteenth consecutive year of revenue growth in Paris with 
average growth over the last five years of circa 5%. We opened a new 
store in Emerainville in September 2016 and our most recent new store 
at Combs-la-Ville opened in June 2017. Both are trading in line with 
their business plans. 
Group underlying EBITDA of £72.9 million increased by 10.7% at CER 
on the prior year and by 13.6% on a reported basis reflecting the impact 
of the strengthening Euro on the profit earned on our Paris business. The 
Group’s strong EBITDA performance, combined with reduced finance costs 
arising from the refinancing of the Group’s USPP notes and amendment 
and extension of the bank facilities completed in May 2017, resulted in 
a 17.7% increase in cash tax adjusted EPS
4
 in the period to 23.3 pence 
(FY2016: 19.8 pence). Going forward, the business will be focusing on 
the Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS
5
 measure, which is consistent with how 
the underlying performance of the business is measured and with how 
management is incentivised for the long term. Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS 
for FY2017 was 23.2 pence (FY2016: 19.8 pence). 
Our property portfolio valuation, including investment properties under 
construction, increased in the year by 6.2% on a constant currency basis. 
After exchange rate movements the portfolio valuation increased by 5.5% 
to £1,007.0 million with the UK portfolio up £33.8 million to a total UK 
value of £744.4 million and the French portfolio increased €27.7 million 
to €298.6 million. 
Reflecting the Group’s strong trading performance, the Board is pleased 
to recommend a 21.7% increase in the final dividend to 9.8 pence per 
share (FY2016: 8.05 pence) resulting in a full year dividend up 20.2% 
to 14.0 pence per share (FY2016: 11.65 pence). 
Notes
1  CER is constant exchange rates (Euro-denominated results for the current period have been retranslated at the exchange rate effective for the comparative period in order to present the 
reported results on a more comparable basis).
2  Like-for-like adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of Wandsworth, Altrincham, Birmingham (including closure of our existing Birmingham store) and 
Emerainville, as well as Chiswick and Combs-la-Ville and the closure of Deptford in the current financial year. In addition, the impact of the acquisition of Space Maker on 29 July 2016 has 
been adjusted.
3  The consideration paid for Alligator on 1 November 2017 was £56.0m, and is subject to customary working capital adjustment.
4  Cash tax adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit or loss for the year before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment 
properties and the associated tax impacts as well as exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue (excluding shares held by the 
Safestore Employee Benefit Trust).
5  Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS is based on the European Public Real Estate Association’ s definition of earnings and is defined as profit or loss for the period after tax but excluding corporate transaction 
costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties and the associated tax impacts. The Company then makes further adjustments for the impact of exceptional items, IFRS 2 
share-based payment charges, exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges. This adjusted earnings is divided by the diluted number of shares. The IFRS 2 cost is excluded as it is written back to 
distributable reserves and is a non-cash item (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). Therefore, neither the Company’ s ability to distribute nor pay dividends are impacted 
(with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). The financial statements will disclose earnings both on a statutory, EPRA and Adjusted Diluted EPRA basis and will provide a full 
reconciliation of the differences in the financial year in which any LTIP awards may vest. Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report

Outlook 
In the last 18 months Safestore has further strengthened its market positions 
in both the UK and Paris with the acquisitions of Space Maker and Alligator, 
the opening of six new stores and the establishment of a pipeline of a further 
four new stores. Including Alligator, the Group has 1.7m sq ft of fully 
invested unlet space available, offering significant operational upside in the 
existing portfolio. We remain focused on further optimising the Group’s 
operational performance whilst our balance sheet strength and flexibility 
provide us with the opportunity to actively consider further selective 
development and acquisition opportunities in our key markets. 
We believe Safestore is well placed to withstand the uncertain 
macro-economic backdrop in the UK and have seen encouraging 
like-for-like revenue trends in both the UK and Paris in the first 
two months of the current financial year. Our recently acquired businesses 
and newly opened stores are trading at least in line with their business 
plans and we look forward with confidence to the 2017/18 financial year.
Our strategy
The Group’s proven strategy remains unchanged and as stated in our 
last Annual Report. We believe that the Group has a well located asset 
base, management expertise, infrastructure, scale and balance sheet 
strength to exploit the current healthy industry dynamics. As we look 
forward, we consider that the Group has the potential to significantly 
further increase its earnings per share by:
 — optimising the trading performance of the existing portfolio;
 — maintaining a strong and flexible capital structure; and
 — taking advantage of selective portfolio management and expansion 
opportunities.
Key performance indicators 
The key performance indicators (“KPls”) of our business are occupancy 
and average rental rate, which drive the revenue of our business. These 
KPls, along with underlying EBITDA, are reported in the financial highlights 
section on page 2 and within the trading performance section of the 
strategic report on page 12.
Optimisation of existing portfolio
With the opening of six new stores in the last 16 months, and the 
acquisitions of Space Maker in July 2016 and Alligator in November 2017 , 
we have strengthened our market-leading portfolio. We have a high quality, 
fully invested estate in both the UK and Paris. Of our 146 stores (including 
Alligator), 93 are in London and the South East of England or in Paris, with 
53 in the other major UK cities. We now operate 44 stores within the M25, 
which represents a higher number of stores than any other competitor. 
With the aforementioned new store openings, our MLA has increased to 
5.71m sq ft at 31 October 2017. At the current occupancy level of 72.6% 
we have 1.6m sq ft of unoccupied space (excluding Alligator), of which 
1.3m sq ft is in our UK stores and 0.3m sq ft in Paris. With the addition 
of the Alligator portfolio from 1 November 2017, a further 0.57m sq ft of 
MLA is added, of which 0.40m sq ft was occupied at 31 October 2017 
resulting in a total MLA of 6.28m sq ft with an occupancy of 72.3%. In 
total this unlet space is the equivalent of circa 40 empty stores located 
across the estate. This available space is fully invested and the related 
operating costs are essentially fixed and already included in the Group 
cost base. Our continued focus will be on ensuring that we drive 
occupancy to utilise this capacity at carefully managed rates.
There are three elements that are critical to the optimisation of our 
existing portfolio.
 — enquiry generation through an effective and efficient 
marketing operation;
 — strong conversion of enquiries into new lets; and
 — disciplined central revenue management and cost control.
In-house digital marketing expertise
Awareness of self-storage is increasing each year but remains relatively 
low with 58% of the UK population either knowing very little or nothing 
about self-storage (source: 2017 SSA Annual Report). In the UK around 
75% of our new customers are using self-storage for the first time. It is 
largely a brand-blind purchase with only 12% of respondents in the 
2017 Self Storage Association Annual Survey stating that a brand would 
influence their purchase decision. Typically customers requiring storage 
start their journey by conducting online research using generic keywords 
in their locality (e.g. “storage in Borehamwood”, “self-storage near me”).
We believe there is a clear benefit of scale in the generation of customer 
enquiries. The Group has continued to invest in its consumer website 
as well as in-house expertise which has resulted in the development 
of a leading digital marketing platform that has generated over 40% 
enquiry growth over the last four years. 
In December 2016, the Group launched a new trading website for the 
Paris business, building on the success of the new UK site, which is 
performing well.
Online enquiries now represent over 82% of our enquiries in the UK 
(FY2016: 81%) and 72% in France (FY2016: 63%). 57% of our online 
enquiries in the UK originate from mobile devices, compared to 54% 
last year, highlighting the need for continual investment in our 
responsive web platform.
Our in-house expertise and skills and significant annual budget enable 
us to achieve the above results. We will continue to invest in activities 
that promote a strong search engine presence to grow enquiry volume 
whilst managing efficiency in terms of the overall cost per enquiry.
Feefo, the independent review system, which allows our customers to 
leave their feedback on the quality of our customer service, has been 
integrated into our website since 2013. Over this period, our customer 
satisfaction score has averaged above 96% and we have achieved a 
Feefo Gold Service Merchant rating every year since its introduction.

Optimisation of existing portfolio continued
Motivated and effective store teams benefiting from improved 
training and coaching 
Having an enthusiastic, well trained and customer-centric sales team 
remains a key differentiator and a strength of our business. Understanding 
the needs of our customer and using this knowledge to develop in-store 
trusted advisers is a fundamental part of driving revenue growth and 
market share.
The experience gained from the integration of the Space Maker 
brand, as well as enhancements to our regional leadership structure, 
supported the recent acquisition of Alligator Self Storage, allowing us 
to quickly integrate the stores into our geographical regional structure. 
Our dedicated online learning platform allows our new colleagues to 
take part in our industry-leading training and development programmes.
November 2016 saw the launch of our internal Store Manager Development 
Programme, designed to provide the business with its future store managers. 
The first group of trainees graduated in November 2017 and the second 
intake of sales consultants have now commenced the 2018 programme.
As with our new Alligator colleagues, new recruits to the business 
benefit from enhanced induction and training tools which have been 
developed in house and enable us to quickly identify high potential 
individuals. Our Store Manager Development Programme demonstrates 
the effectiveness of our learning tools. In a spirit of constant improvement 
our content and delivery process is dynamically enhanced through our 
360-degree feedback process utilising the learnings from not only the 
candidates, but also our training store managers. This allows our 
people to be trained with the knowledge and skills to sell effectively 
in today’s market place. 
All new recruits receive individual performance targets within four weeks 
of joining the business and are placed on the “pay-for-skills” programme, 
which allows accelerated basic pay increases dependent on success in 
demonstrating specific and defined skills. The key target of our programme, 
to ensure that close to 100% of our store managers are promoted 
internally, still remains and we are pleased with our progress to date.
The training and development of our store and customer-facing colleagues 
is an essential part of our daily routines. In 2017 we delivered a further 
22,500 hours of training through face-to-face sessions and via our 
internally developed online learning tool. This Learning Management 
System also provides the opportunity for team members to receive 
rigorously enforced health and safety, fire and compliance training, 
ensuring that our staff are up to date in relation to their technical 
knowledge and continue to operate a safe environment for both our 
colleagues and customers. These modules are continually updated to 
target the areas of most opportunity and maintain colleague engagement.
To further support our cyber-security efforts we have introduced further 
enhanced online training modules. All colleagues are required to 
complete this training.
Our performance dashboard allows our store and field teams to focus on 
the key operating metrics of the business, providing an appropriate level 
of management information to enable swift decision making. Reporting 
performance down to individual level enhances our competitive approach 
to team and individual performance. We continue to reward our people 
for their performances with bonuses of up to 50% of basic salary based 
on their achievements against individual new lets, occupancy, ancillary 
sales and pricing targets. In addition, a Values and Behaviours framework 
is overlaid on individuals’ financial performance in order to assess team 
members’ performance and development needs on a quarterly basis.
Customers continue to be at the heart of everything we do, whether it 
be in store, online or in their communities. Our Feefo customer service 
score of 96% reflects our ongoing commitment to their satisfaction.
Central revenue management and cost control
We continue to pursue a balanced approach to revenue management. 
We aim to optimise revenue by improving the utilisation of the available 
space in our portfolio at carefully managed rates. Our central pricing 
team is responsible for the management of our dynamic pricing policy, 
the implementation of promotional offers and the identification of additional 
ancillary revenue opportunities. Whilst price lists are managed centrally 
and are adjusted on a real-time basis when needed, the store sales 
teams have the ability to offer a Lowest Price Guarantee in the event 
that a local competitor is offering a lower price. 
During the last year, we have continued to enhance our business 
intelligence software, which we first implemented in 2015. This has 
improved the team’s ability to identify pricing opportunities, monitor 
competitive pricing in local markets and to establish optimal unit mix 
in individual stores. 
Our strategy to optimise revenue is implemented by continually 
reviewing the appropriate mix of occupancy and rate growth targets, 
store by store.
Rate growth is predominantly influenced by:
 — the store location and catchment area;
 — the volume of enquiries generated online;
 — the store team skills at converting these enquiries into new lets at the 
expected price; and
 — the pricing policy and the confidence provided by analytical 
capabilities that smaller players may lack.
We believe that Safestore has a very strong proposition in each 
of these areas.
Costs are managed centrally with a lean structure maintained at the 
Head Office. 
We are continually challenging our cost base and in 2017 we completed 
a full retendering process of maintenance suppliers to further improve 
the efficiency, quality and cost of both our planned and reactive 
maintenance. Our rollout of LED lighting has moved at pace in 2017 
and we plan to complete the entire estate by March 2018, reducing 
our CO
2
 emissions by the equivalent of removing 800 cars from the 
road per annum.
Strong and flexible capital structure
Since 2014 we have refinanced the business on three occasions 
and believe we now have a capital structure that is appropriate for our 
business and which provides us with the flexibility to take advantage 
of carefully evaluated development and acquisition opportunities. 
On 31 May 2017 we completed the refinancing of the Group’s US 
private placement notes (“USPP”) and an amendment and extension 
of its existing bank facilities to extend the average maturity and lower 
the cost of the Group’s debt financing.

The key terms of the new and amended arrangements are as follows:
US private placement notes
 — The previous $65.6 million 5.83%

 2019 USPP and $47.3 million 
6.74%

 2024 USPP were repaid in full;
 — New Euro and Sterling-denominated USPP notes were issued with 
the following tenor and fixed coupons:
 — €50.9 million 7 year notes at a coupon of 1.59%;
 — €74.1 million 10 year notes at a coupon of 2.00%; and
 — £50.5 million 12 year notes at a coupon of 2.92%.
Amendment and extension of bank facilities
 — The previous UK and Euro revolving credit facilities were extended 
by two years from June 2020 to June 2022, with an option (on an 
uncommitted basis) to extend for a further year; the previous 
£126 million term loan was cancelled.
 — As at 31 May 2017, the amended facilities comprised:
 — a £190 million revolving credit facility; and
 — a €70 million revolving facility.
 — The margin on the amended facilities was reduced by 25bps from 
150bps to 125bps.
 — Similarly, the non-utilisation fee on the undrawn facilities reduced 
from 0.6% to 0.5%.
 — The Group also had the option (on an uncommitted basis) to 
increase the quantum of the Sterling revolving credit facility by 
£60 million. This option was exercised in October 2017 to increase 
the UK revolving facility to £250 million, in anticipation of the acquisition 
of the Alligator business, which completed following the year end 
on 1 November 2017.
As part of the refinancing, the Group made a “make-whole” payment to 
existing USPP noteholders of £12.4 million and broke the Sterling/Dollar 
cross currency swap relating to the existing USPP notes, leading to the 
Group receiving £13.9 million, being the mark-to-market value of the 
swap which was in the Group’s favour and which was carried at that 
value at the date of breakage. Exceptional finance charges reported 
by the Group in respect of the refinancing for the year are £16.3 million, 
comprising the £12.4 million “make-whole” payment, with the balance 
relating to fees and the write off of previous unamortised issue costs. 
The refinancing was broadly cash flow neutral.
The USPP was issued to insurance company affiliates of AIG, Inc. 
and the bank facilities are provided by a syndicate of RBS, HSBC, 
Lloyds, Santander and BRED. 
Subsequent to amendment and extension of the bank facilities, the Group 
also restructured its interest rate hedge arrangements. Existing swaps, 
which mirrored the previous term of the bank facilities to June 2020, 
at weighted average fixed rates of 1.34% (over £100 million) and 0.309% 
(over €30 million), were broken, resulting in a cash outflow of £2.6 million. 
New interest rate hedge agreements were put in place to June 2022, 
swapping LIBOR on £100 million at an effective rate of 0.8145% and 
EURIBOR on €30 million at an effective rate of 0.1635%.
At 31 October 2017, based on the current level of borrowings and interest 
swap rates, the Group’s weighted average cost of debt is 2. 14%, a reduction 
of 144bps since the prior year end (FY2016: 3.58%). The weighted average 
maturity of the Group’s debt has increased from 3.9 years at 31 October 2016 
to 6.7 years at the current year end. The Group’s LTV ratio under the new 
financing arrangements was 36% as at 31 October 2017; however, this 
has been distorted due to the drawdown of £56 million of loans just prior 
to the year end in anticipation of the Alligator acquisition, which completed 
immediately after the year end on 1 November 2017 . On a pro forma basis, 
excluding this £56 million drawdown, LTV at 31 October 2017 would 
have been 31%, or by including the value of the Alligator stores at 
31 October 2017, LTV would have been 34%.
This LTV and interest cover ratio of 6.7x for the year ended 31 October 2017 
provide us with significant headroom compared to our banking covenants. 
We have £108 million of available bank facilities at 31 October 2017 .
Taking into account the improvements we have made in the performance of 
the business and the reduction in underlying finance charges of £9.0 million 
per annum over the last four years, the Group is now capable of generating 
free cash after dividends sufficient to fund the building of 2–3 new stores 
per annum depending on location and availability of land.
The Group evaluates development and acquisition opportunities in 
a careful and disciplined manner against rigorous investment criteria. 
Our investment policy requires certain Board-approved hurdle rates to 
be considered achievable prior to progressing an investment opportunity. 
In addition, the Group aims to maintain LTV of between 30% and 40% 
for the foreseeable future.
Portfolio management
As ever, our approach to store development and acquisition in the 
UK and Paris will continue to be pragmatic, flexible and focused 
on the return on capital.
Our property teams in both the UK and Paris are continually seeking 
investment opportunities in new sites to add to the store pipeline. 
However, investments will only be made if they comply with our 
disciplined and strict investment criteria.
In the last 16 months, the Group opened six new stores in Chiswick 
and Wandsworth in London, Birmingham, Altrincham, and Emerainville 
and Combs-la-Ville in Paris as well as completing the extension and 
refurbishment of our Acton and Longpont (Paris) stores. All of these 
stores are performing in line with or ahead of their business plans.
In December 2016, we acquired the freehold of a site in Mitcham, 
in South West London. We now have planning permission and have 
started construction on a new circa 54,000 sq ft store on this site. 
The store is scheduled to open in the first half of the current 
financial year.

Portfolio management continued
In July 2017, we obtained planning permission and exchanged contracts 
for a new 37,000 sq ft leasehold store located between Paddington and 
Marble Arch in central London. The lease will be for a period of 20 years, 
with an option to extend for a further ten years. We anticipate that the 
store will open in the second calendar quarter of 2018.
In addition, in October 2017, we completed the acquisition of a 
1.34 acre industrial site at Merry Hill, around ten miles west of the 
centre of Birmingham, in a very prominent location close to Merry Hill 
regional shopping centre. Subject to receiving planning consent we 
expect to open a purpose-built freehold 55,000 sq ft store in the 
first quarter of 2019.
In Paris, where regulatory barriers are likely to continue to restrict new 
development inside the city, we will continue our policy of segmenting 
our demand and encouraging the customers who wish to reduce their 
storage costs to utilise the second belt stores. We will also manage 
occupancy and rates upwards in the more central stores and ensure 
that pricing recognises the value customers place on the convenience 
of physical proximity. The strong selling organisation and store network 
established by Une Pièce en Plus in Paris uniquely enables it to implement 
this commercial policy to complement the strong second belt markets 
in which we operate.
In April 2017, we completed the acquisition of a freehold site in 
south-eastern Paris adjacent to the M104 motorway at Combs-la-Ville. 
The cost to buy and convert the site was €6.3 million and the store 
opened for business in June 2017. The building was constructed in 
2001 and is in good condition, requiring a relatively simple reconfiguration 
for self-storage usage. The store has 73,500 sq ft of MLA and circa 
10,000 sq ft of serviced offices. 
We believe there will be further opportunities to develop new stores 
in the outer suburbs of Paris and are actively reviewing the market 
for new opportunities.
In November 2017, we exchanged contracts on a site at Poissy, in the 
west of Paris, an area where we currently have no stores. We expect 
to complete the acquisition of the site in the first calendar quarter of 
2018 and to open a freehold 80,000 sq ft store in summer 2018.  
In June 2017, we accepted an offer of £4.8 million on our leasehold 
Deptford store. The store contributed £0.4 million of EBITDA after rent 
in the year ended October 2016. The transaction was completed on 
31 August 2017.
In September 2017, we continued our programme of extending the 
leases on our leasehold store portfolio. The lease on our Oldbury store, 
which had six years remaining, has been extended to 2042 resulting in 
a certain term of 25 years. A year’s rent-free period was agreed as part 
of the extension. We have now extended the leases on 18 stores or 51% 
of our leased store portfolio in the UK over the last five years and our 
average lease length remaining now stands at 13.3 years as compared 
to 13.7 years at FY2016.
Acquisitions
Over the last 18 months Safestore has completed two acquisitions, 
adding 24 stores to the Group’s portfolio at a total consideration 
of £98.3 million (prior to potential working capital adjustments 
in respect of the Alligator acquisition). Both acquisitions are 
immediately earnings accretive.
Space Maker
At the end of July 2016 we completed the acquisition of Space Maker 
for a total consideration of £42.3 million. 
Space Maker was the ninth largest self-storage portfolio in the UK, 
with twelve stores, located in Bournemouth (two stores), Colchester, 
Redhill, Romford, Brentford, Chelmsford, Exeter, Leeds, Plymouth, 
Portsmouth and Poole, and had a fully invested built out lettable 
area of circa 496,000 sq ft. Six of the Space Maker stores are freehold 
or long leasehold and six are leasehold stores with an average remaining 
lease length of 14.9 years at 31 October 2017.
Space Maker has been fully integrated into the Safestore portfolio from 
an operational perspective during the course of the 2017 financial year, 
and is performing in line with its business plan.
Alligator
Subsequent to the year end, on 1 November 2017 the Group completed 
the acquisition of Stork Self Storage (Holdings) Limited (“SSSHL ”) trading 
as Alligator Self Storage. The consideration was £56.0 million (subject 
to customary working capital adjustment) and was paid in cash on 
completion of the acquisition.
SSSHL was the eleventh largest self-storage portfolio in the UK, with 
twelve stores with a maximum lettable area estimated at circa 569,000 
sq ft. SSSHL ’s stores, which are geographically complementary to the 
existing estate, are located in London (Camden), the South East of the 
UK (Fareham, Farnham, Luton and Winchester), Birmingham (three 
stores), Southampton, Bolton, Bristol and Nottingham. Ten of the 
SSSHL stores are freehold or long leasehold and two are leasehold 
stores with an average remaining lease length of 15.3 years.
The acquisition reinforces Safestore’s position as the UK’s largest 
self-storage group by number of sites with a combined total of 120 stores, 
67 of which are in London and the South East. The SSSHL portfolio 
was 70% occupied (of maximum lettable area) at 31 October 2017.
Pro forma EBITDA after rent is currently circa £4.3 million per annum on

Portfolio summary
The self-storage market has been growing in the last 15 years across 
many European countries but few regions offer the unique characteristic 
of London and Paris, both of which consist of large, wealthy and densely 
populated markets. In the London region, the population is 13 million 
inhabitants with a density of 5,200 inhabitants per square mile in the 
region, 11,000 per square mile in the city of London and up to 32,000 
in the densest boroughs. 
The population of the Paris urban area is 10.7 million inhabitants with 
a density of 9,300 inhabitants per square mile in the urban area but 
54,000 per square mile in the City of Paris and first belt, where 72% of 
our French stores are located and which has one of the highest densities 
in the western world. 85% of the Paris region population live in central 
parts of the city versus the rest of the urban area, which compares with 
60% in the London region. There are currently circa 245 storage centres 
within the M25 as compared to only circa 90 in the Paris urban area. 
In addition, barriers to entry in these two important city markets are high, 
due to land values and limited availability of sites, as well as planning 
regulation. This is particularly the case for Paris and its first belt, which 
inhibits new development possibilities.
Our combined operations in London and Paris, with 69 stores, contribute 
£79.4 million of revenue and £55.1 million of store EBITDA and offer a unique 
exposure to the two most attractive European self-storage markets.
We have a strong position in both the UK and Paris markets operating 
108 stores in the UK (excluding Alligator), 62 of which are in London 
and the South East, and 26 stores in Paris. 
In the UK, 66% of our revenue is generated by our stores in London and 
the South East. On average, our stores in London and the South East 
are smaller than in the rest of the UK but the rental rates achieved are 
materially higher, enabling these stores to typically achieve similar or 
better margins than the larger stores. In London, excluding Alligator, 
we operate 43 stores within the M25, more than any other competitor. 
In France, we have a leading position in the heart of the affluent City 
of Paris market, with eight stores branded as Une Pièce en Plus (“UPP”) 
(“A spare room”) with more than twice the number of stores of our two 
major competitors combined. 69% of the UPP stores are located in a 
cluster within a five-mile radius of the city centre, which facilitates strong 
operational and marketing synergies as well as options to differentiate 
and channel customers to the right store subject to their preference 
for convenience or price affordability. The Parisian market has attractive 
socio-demographic characteristics for self-storage and we believe that 
UPP enjoys unique strategic strength in such an attractive market.
Together, as at 31 October 2017, London, the South East and Paris 
represent 66% of our owned stores, 74% of our revenues, as well 
as 59% of our available unlet capacity.
In addition, Safestore has the benefit of a leading national presence in 
the UK regions where the stores are predominantly located in the centre 
of key metropolitan areas such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, 
Bristol, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Market
The self-storage market in the UK and France remains relatively 
immature compared to geographies such as the USA and Australia. 
The Self Storage Association (“SSA”) Annual Survey (May 2017) confirmed 
that self-storage capacity stands at 0.64 sq ft per head of population in the 
UK and 0. 15 sq ft per capita in France. Whilst the Paris market density is 
greater than France, we estimate it to be significantly lower than the UK 
at around 0.36 sq ft per inhabitant. This compared with 7 .8 sq ft per 
inhabitant in the USA and 1.8 sq ft in Australia. In the UK, in order to reach 
the US density of supply would require the addition of around 12,000 
stores as compared to the current circa 1,000 stores. In the Paris 
region, it would require around 1,800 new facilities versus circa 90 
currently opened.
While capacity increased significantly between 2007 and 2010 with 
respondents to the survey opening an average of 32 stores per annum, 
new additions have been limited to an average of 19 stores per annum 
between 2011 and 2016 (including container storage openings).
New supply in London and Paris is likely to be limited in the short 
and medium term as a result of planning restrictions and the availability 
of suitable land. 
Respondents to the survey indicated aspirations to develop an average 
of 49 stores per annum from 2017 to 2019. Typically, actual developments 
have averaged less than 50% of respondents’ aspirations, although the 
25 new openings in 2016 were closer than usual to the previous year’s 
aspirations. This recent history suggests that circa 25 to 40 new stores 
are likely to be added in the coming year.
The supply in the UK market, according to the SSA survey, remains 
relatively fragmented. Safestore is the leader by number of stores 
with 120 wholly owned sites (including Alligator), followed by Big Yellow 
with 73 wholly owned stores, Access with 57 stores, Shurgard with 
26 stores, Lok’n Store with 25 stores and Storage King with 25 stores. 
In aggregate, the top ten leading operators account for 27% of the UK 
store portfolio. The remaining circa 1,000 self-storage outlets (including 
317 container-based operations) are independently owned in small 
chains or single units. In total there are 693 storage businesses 
operating in the UK.
Our French business, UPP, is mainly present in the core wealthier 
and more densely populated inner Paris and first belt areas, whereas 
our two main competitors, Shurgard and Homebox, have a greater 
presence in the outskirts and second belt of Paris. 
Consumer awareness of self-storage remains low, providing an 
opportunity for future industry growth. The SSA survey indicated that 
58% (58% in 2016) of consumers either knew nothing about the service 
offered by self-storage operators or had not heard of self-storage at all. 
The opportunity to grow awareness, combined with limited new industry 
supply, makes for an attractive industry backdrop.
Self-storage is a brand-blind product. 70% of respondents were unable 
to name a self-storage brand in the SSA survey, 88%
1
 of respondents 
would not consider brand in their decision and 97% would not even use 
brand as a search criteria. The lack of relevance of brand in the process 
of purchasing a self-storage product emphasises the need for operators 
to have a strong online presence. This requirement for a strong online 
presence was also reiterated by the SSA survey where 71% of those 
surveyed (68% in 2016) confirmed that an internet search would be their 
chosen means of finding a self-storage unit to contact, whilst knowledge 
of a physical location of a store as reason for enquiry was circa 23% of 
respondents (circa 28% in 2016).
Note
1 Source: Self Storage Association (“SSA”) Annual Survey (May 2016).
There are numerous drivers of self-storage growth. Most private and 
business customers need storage either temporarily or permanently for 
different reasons at any point in the economic cycle, resulting in a market 
depth that is in our view the reason for its exceptional resilience. The growth 
of the market is driven both by the fluctuation of economic conditions, 
which has an impact on the mix of demand, and by growing awareness 
of the product.
Our domestic customers’ need for storage is often driven by lifestyle 
events such as births, marriages, bereavements, divorces or by the 
housing market, including house moves and developments and moves 
between rental properties. Safestore has estimated that UK owner-occupied 
housing transactions drive around 8–13% of the Group’s storage revenue. 
The SSA survey confirmed that only 28% of domestic self-storage customers 
stored for reasons related to a property move and this would include 
people renting accommodation.
Our business customer base includes a range of businesses from 
start-up online retailers through to multinational corporates utilising 
our national coverage to store in multiple locations while maintaining 
flexibility in their cost base.

Business model
Safestore’s proven business model remains unchanged from our 
previous Annual Report.
The Group operates in a market with relatively low consumer awareness. 
It is anticipated that this will increase over time as the industry matures. 
Historically, despite the financial crisis and the implementation of VAT on 
self-storage in 2012, the industry has been exceptionally resilient. In the 
context of uncertain economic conditions as the UK approaches Brexit, 
the industry remains well positioned with limited new supply coming 
into the self-storage market.
With more stores inside London’s M25 than any other operator 
and a strong position in central Paris, Safestore has leading positions 
in the two most important and demographically favourable markets 
in Europe. In addition, our regional presence in the UK is unsurpassed 
and contributes to the success of our industry-leading National Accounts 
business. In the UK, Safestore is the leading operator by number of 
wholly owned stores. Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report
11 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Our capital-efficient portfolio of 134 wholly owned stores in the UK 
and Paris (146 stores including Alligator acquired on 1 November 2017) 
consists of a mix of freehold and leasehold stores. In order to grow 
our business and secure the best locations for our facilities, we have 
maintained a flexible approach to leasehold and freehold developments. 
Currently, (excluding Alligator) approximately one-third of our stores in the UK 
are leaseholds with an average remaining lease length at 31 October 2017 
of 13.3 years (FY2016: 13.7 years). Although our property valuation for 
leaseholds is conservatively based on future cash flows until the next 
contractual lease renewal date, Safestore has a demonstrable track record 
of successfully regearing leases several years before renewal whilst 
at the same time achieving concessions from landlords. 
In England, we benefit from the Landlord and Tenant Act that protects 
our rights for renewal except in the case of redevelopment. The vast 
majority of our leasehold stores have building characteristics or 
locations in retail parks that make current usage either the optimal and 
best use of the property or the only one authorised by planning. We 
observe that our landlords, who are property investors, value the quality 
of Safestore as a tenant and typically prefer to extend the length of the 
leases that they have in their portfolio, enabling Safestore to maintain 
favourable terms. 
In Paris, where 42% of stores are leaseholds, our leases typically benefit 
from the well enshrined Commercial Lease statute that provides that 
tenants own the commercial property of the premises and that they 
are entitled to renew their lease at a rent that is indexed to the National 
Construction Index published by the state. Taking into account this 
context, the valuer values the French leaseholds based on an indefinite 
property tenure, similar to freeholds.
Our experience is that being flexible in its approach has enabled 
Safestore to operate from properties that would have been otherwise 
unavailable and to generate strong returns on capital invested.
Safestore excels in the generation of customer enquiries which are 
received through a variety of channels including the internet, telephone 
and “walk-ins”. In the early days of the industry, local directories and 
store visibility were key drivers of enquiries. 
The internet is now by far the dominant channel, accounting for 82% 
of our enquiries in the UK and 72% in France. Telephone enquiries 
comprise 11% of the UK total and 19% in France, and “walk-ins” 
amount to only 7% (UK) and 9% (France). This key change is a clear 
benefit to the leading national operators that possess the budget and 
the management skills necessary to generate a commanding presence 
in the major search engines. Safestore has developed a leading digital 
marketing platform that has generated 40% enquiry growth over the 
last four years. Towards the end of 2015 the Group launched a new 
dynamic and mobile-friendly UK website, which has achieved its aim of 
providing the customer with an even clearer, more efficient experience. 
In December 2016, a similar website was launched in our Paris business.
Although mostly generated online, our enquiries are predominantly 
handled directly by the stores and, in the UK, we have a Customer 
Support Centre (“CSC”) which now handles 18% of all enquiries, 
in particular when the store staff are busy handling calls or outside 
of normal store opening hours.
Our pricing platform provides the store and CSC staff with system-
generated real-time prices managed by our centrally based yield 
management team. Local staff have certain levels of discretion to 
flex the system-generated prices but this is continually monitored.
Customer service standards are high and customer satisfaction feedback 
is consistently very positive. Over the last twelve months we have achieved 
over 96% customer satisfaction, based on “excellent” or “good” ratings 
as collected by Feefo via our customer website.
The key drivers of sales success are the capacity to generate enquiries 
in a digital world, the capacity to provide storage locations that are 
conveniently located close to the customers’ requirements and the 
ability to maintain a consistently high quality, motivated retail team that 
is able to secure customer sales at an appropriate storage rate, all of 
which can be better provided by larger, more efficient organisations.
We remain focused on business as well as domestic customers. Our 
national network means that we are uniquely placed to further grow the 
business customer market and, in particular, National Accounts. Business 
customers in the UK now constitute 49% of our total space let and have 
an average length of stay of 30 months. Within our business customer 
category, our National Accounts business continues to grow with storage 
revenue increasing by 102% compared with 2013. The space let to 
National Accounts customers has increased by 57% compared with 
2013 and, at 385,000 sq ft, constitutes 12% of our total occupied space 
in the UK business. Approximately two-thirds of the space occupied by 
National Accounts customers is outside London, demonstrating the 
importance and quality of our well invested national estate.
The business (excluding Alligator) now has in excess of 55,000 business 
and domestic customers with an average length of stay of 31 months 
and 22 months respectively.
The cost base of our business is relatively fixed. Each store typically 
employs three staff. Our Group Head Office comprises business 
support functions such as Yield Management, Property, Marketing, 
HR, IT and Finance.
Since the completion of the rebalancing of our capital structure in early 
2014 and the subsequent amendments and extensions of our banking 
facilities in summer 2015 and May 2017, as well as the May 2017 
refinancing of our US private placement notes, Safestore has secure 
financing, a strong balance sheet and significant covenant headroom. 
This provides the Group with financial flexibility and the ability to 
grow organically and via carefully selected new development or 
acquisition opportunities.
At 31 October 2017, prior to completion of the Alligator acquisition, 
we had 1.3m sq ft of unoccupied space in the UK and 0.3m sq ft in 
France, equivalent to over 40 full new stores. Our main focus is on filling 
the spare capacity in our stores at optimally yield-managed rates. The 
operational leverage of our business model will ensure that the bulk 
of the incremental revenue converts to profit given the relatively fixed 
nature of our cost base. Strategic report

The UK has delivered another strong year growing revenue by 11.6%. 
The annualisation of the acquisition of Space Maker (29 July 2016) has 
contributed to this growth as have the four recently opened stores so, 
on a like-for-like basis, revenue grew by 3.1% in the year. The first full year 
of our ownership of Space Maker has gone to plan with the business fully 
integrated into the Group from an operational perspective. The four recently 
opened stores (Wandsworth, Chiswick, Birmingham and Altrincham) 
are all performing at least in line with their business plans.
Total occupancy grew by 95,000 sq ft in the year (FY2016: 397,000 sq ft). 
The reduction reflected the acquisition of Space Maker, which constituted 
341,000 sq ft of the growth in the previous year. The recently opened 
four stores diluted total closing occupancy which ended the year at 
71.6% (FY2016: 69.7%) but like-for-like closing occupancy grew by 
0.6ppts to 72.5% (FY2016: 71.9%). Like-for-like average occupancy 
for the year grew by 1.5%.
We take a balanced approach to revenue management and our 
occupancy growth was accompanied by a 0.9% increase in the 
like-for-like average storage rate for the year. Sequentially, our Q4 
like-for-like average rate was 2.8% higher than the rate achieved 
in Q3 2017.
We remain focused on our cost base. During the year, our cost base, on 
a like-for-like basis, increased by just 0.5% or £0.2 million. Our total cost 
base grew by £3.8 million, reflecting the annualisation of the acquisition of 
Space Maker and the cost bases relating to the recently opened stores.
As a result, underlying EBITDA for the UK business was £52.8 million 
(FY2016: £46.5 million), an increase of £6.3 million or 13.5%.

Our Paris business had another strong year growing like-for-like revenue by 
4.0%. Combined with the impact of the two new stores opened since 
summer 2016, total revenue grew by 5. 1%. The impact of the 9% weakening 
of the average Sterling to Euro exchange rate across the period resulted in 
the Sterling equivalent revenue growing by 15.7% for the full year. 
Pricing was robust and our like-for-like average rate was up 2.3% for 
the full year. Like-for-like closing occupancy ended the year at 84.7% 
(FY2016: 80.7%). Our like-for-like average occupancy for the year 
was up 1.2% on 2016.
We opened a new store at Emerainville in the east of Paris at the end of 
the 2016 financial year, which added 60,000 sq ft of MLA to our portfolio. 
In June 2017, we opened a freehold site in south-eastern Paris adjacent 
to the M104 motorway at Combs-la-Ville, which added 73,500 sq ft of 
MLA and circa 10,000 sq ft of serviced offices. Given that these stores 
have only recently started to trade, they have a dilutive effect on total 
closing occupancy. In addition the extension of our Longpont store, 
which adds 22,600 sq ft of new space, completed in March 2017.
The cost base in Paris remained well controlled during the year with 
like-for-like costs growing by 3.1% or €0.4 million. The total cost base grew 
by 8.5% or €1.1 million, reflecting the new store openings which typically 
make a loss in the first full year of operations. As a result, like-for-like 
underlying EBITDA in Paris grew by €1.0 million and underlying EBITDA 
grew by €0.7 million to €23.1 million (FY2016: €22.4 million).

Notes
1  Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation. 
Underlying profit before tax is defined as underlying EBITDA less leasehold rent, depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment and net finance charges relating to bank loans and cash.
2 Occupancy excludes offices but includes bulk tenancy. As at 31 October 2017, closing occupancy includes 27,000 sq ft of bulk tenancy (31 October 2016: 37,000 sq ft).
3 MLA is maximum lettable area. At 31 October 2017, Group MLA was 5.71m sq ft (FY2016: 5.59m sq ft).
4 Average storage rate is calculated as the revenue generated from self-storage revenues divided by the average square footage occupied during the period in question.
5  Like-for-like adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of Wandsworth, Altrincham, Birmingham (including closure of our existing Birmingham store) and Emerainville, as 
well as Chiswick and Combs-la-Ville and the closure of Deptford in the current financial year. In addition, the impact of the acquisition of Space Maker on 29 July 2016 has been adjusted.
