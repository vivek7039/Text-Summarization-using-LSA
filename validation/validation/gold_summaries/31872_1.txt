I am pleased to present my report on 
Wilmington’s performance for the 12 
months to 30 June 2017. During the year 
revenue increased by 14% (£14.6m) and 
was up 9% in constant currency terms. 
Adjusted EBITA was also up increasing by 
6% to £23.4m. We achieved good revenue 
growth from our Risk & Compliance 
division up 9% overall (£3.5m) and from 
our Healthcare division which was up 
28% (£8.4m). The Professional division 
also recorded growth, up 7% (£2.8m) 
albeit supported by acquisition-led growth 
from SWAT (£4.7m). HSJ acquired on 31 
January 2017 added £3.7m to Healthcare 
revenue.
Organic revenue growth (excluding 
currency and acquisitions) remains a 
priority but this year’s overall organic 
growth was down 0.8%. Organic 
performance was impacted by the well-
publicised issues around AMT and the law 
for lawyers’ products. Adjusting for these 
two businesses, over 85% by value of the 
remainder of our businesses delivered on 
average organic growth in excess of 2%. 
This represents an improvement over the 
performance for the first half year which 
showed an organic revenue decline of 2%. 
The growth within Healthcare of 28% 
reflects excellent returns from acquisitions 
we have made since the beginning of 2016 
and supported by 9% organic growth 
from our UK healthcare business. Overall 
the Healthcare division’s organic growth 
was 3% in constant currency terms with 
overall growth in healthcare offset by the 
expected decline in our legacy non-
healthcare assets. The Risk & Compliance 
increase of 9% (4% organic constant 
currency) continued its trend of strong 
organic growth led by the compliance 
training business which was up 8% 
despite some slippage into 2017/18. 
Whilst the Professional division recorded 
revenue growth up 7% this was due to 
the acquisition of SWAT and support from 
underlying growth from Accountancy 
which more than offset the issues with our 
law for lawyers’ product lines and AMT our 
Investment bank training business.
Profit growth generally was constrained 
by the previously announced planned 
investments particularly in our compliance 
businesses, from the weaker performance 
from AMT and from our US operations; 
and some slippage of compliance training 
assignments. Recent acquisitions have 
however performed strongly in both 
revenue and profit contribution terms and 
these results have also benefited from 
favourable currency exchange effects on 
both revenue and on profits adding around 
£5.0m and £1.0m respectively. 
Finance costs before adjusting items were 
up 16% (£0.3m) compared to 2015/16 
reflecting inter alia £20.3m spent on 
acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and 
deferred consideration during the year 
which contributed to an increase in net 
debt of £5.3m to finish at £40.0m.
The growth in Adjusted EBITA offset by the 
increase in adjusted finance costs resulted 
in Adjusted Profit before Tax up £1.1m 
(5%) to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m).

Divisional revenue increased by 9% 
(£3.5m) and contribution was down slightly 
by 3% (£0.4m) reflecting investment within 
our compliance business in new products, 
the new North American compliance 
operation, and in additional support staff 
to expand our infrastructure and to help 
in the drive to boost ICA membership. 
We had also increased resources during 
the final quarter of 2017 on the back of 
our recent success in winning two large 
international training programmes which 
are now expected to be delivered during 
2017/18. These additional resources and 
investments have impacted margins in 
the short term but are expected to benefit 
contribution in 2017/18 and indeed future 
years.
During the year, the net investment in 
our North American office amounted to 
£0.5m, and additional resources in terms 
of senior appointments, trainers, sales and 
administrative support staff together with 
digital learning capability and bespoke 
compliance programmes to expand our 
infrastructure were £0.5m. 
“This year we will sharpen our focus further still. We will continue 
the integration of our Professional division and accelerate the digital 
transition of our products. Later in the year we will also be bringing 
300, nearly one third of our global workforce, of Wilmington’s people 
under one roof, reinforcing our culture as ‘One Wilmington’, ensuring 
we can collaborate effectively and helping us to attract and retain the 
best talent in our industry.”

Compliance 
Our compliance business which accounts 
for just over 50% of the division’s revenue 
grew by 10% compared to 2015/16 (4% 
constant currency). However, within this, 
our compliance training businesses which 
are the division’s main engine of growth, 
grew by 12% (8% constant currency) 
slightly down on our expectations due 
to some slippage of assignments into 
2017/18. 
Compliance Week, our US Governance 
Risk and Compliance (GRC) events and 
information business reported revenue up 
16% and on a constant currency basis 
revenue was flat. There is an ongoing 
programme of investment in new content 
and technology to reposition the business 
as a GRC resource centre and events 
business collaborating with other parts 
of Wilmington, in particular ICT and 
ICA but also FRA on joint events. The 
flagship event in Washington held in May 
2017 enjoyed continued success and 
again attracted record delegates and 
sponsorship offsetting some decline in 
subscribers and sponsored events in 
the rest of the business. For 2017/18 
continued investment is being made to 
strengthen the content offering and more 
topic areas will be added together with 
supporting databases. 
Risk
Axco, the industry leading provider of 
insurance market intelligence, regulation 
and compliance information reported 8% 
revenue growth (3% constant currency) 
helped by the continued success of its 
digital subscription products and the 
insight products which enhance our 
analytical insurance offerings. 
The remainder of the risk part of the 
division performed well recording 9% 
growth overall (3% constant currency). In 
August 2016, we successfully opened a 
new insurance events and training office 
in Barcelona in response to increasing 
localised demand for our insurance 
offerings. 
Overall divisional contribution decreased 
by £0.4m (3%) to £12.3m (2016: £12.7m). 
Margins were down to 29% (2016: 
33%) reflecting the investments outlined

compliance training businesses.

The division recorded overall revenue 
growth of 7% (£2.8m) attributed to the 
acquisition of SWAT which contributed 
£4.7m of revenue and to foreign currency 
benefits of £1.2m. The integration process 
for SWAT is progressing well and the 
business is performing in line with plan. 
Organic (constant currency) revenue which 
was down overall by 8% was reflective 
of the issues at AMT and our Law for 
Lawyers business. 
Investment bank training as previously 
reported had a weak first half year which 
was mainly due to the competition issues 
previously highlighted but also due to 
some softening of training assignments in 
the Asia Pacific region. The second half 
year saw stabilisation of the business and 
we are now entering the busy summer 
training period with early indications of 
slow but more stable trading. 
The division saw good underlying growth 
from accountancy training (adjusting for 
the benefit from the one off double UK 
Government fiscal budget in 2015/16) 
offset by previously reported challenging 
market conditions in the Law for Lawyers 
businesses following changes to the Legal 
CLE rules. 
Divisional contribution was down 5% 
(£0.3m) on last year at £5.9m and margins, 
as we saw at the half year were particularly 
impacted by the issues at AMT.

www.wilmingtonplc.com Stock Code: WIL 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
Wilmington Healthcare business, which 
following the HSJ acquisition will 
represent over 80% of the division by 
revenue on a pro-forma basis, had a 
good year with organic revenue from 
the UK businesses up 9%. The legacy 
UK businesses and brands have been 
successfully supplemented by strategically 
relevant acquisitions and unified under the 
Wilmington Healthcare brand and a single 
management team. This performance 
was supported by good performances 
from APM and from our US healthcare 
networking events. 
HSJ which was acquired on 31 January 
2017 has had an excellent start and has 
been fully integrated with the employees 
transferred to our Underwood Street 
offices in March and all transactional 
processes and functions transferred onto 
Wilmington systems by 30 June 2017. 
The legacy data suppression and charities 
businesses were marginally down (4%) as 
expected in revenue terms compared to 
last year and the focus continues to be on 
delivering higher margins through ongoing 
reorganisation and the review of marginal 
business operations. 
Benefiting from profit contributions from 
acquisitions, overall contribution increased 
by 33% (£2.4m) to £9.7m. Contribution 
growth was 27% in constant currency 
terms.
Group overheads
Group overheads, which include board 
costs, head office salaries as well as 
unallocated central overheads, increased 
by £0.4m (11%) to £3.9m (2016: £3.5m). 
Project Sixth Gear update 
As outlined in the Chairman’s section we 
are progressing well with project Sixth 
Gear which is a project to speed up the 
integration of Wilmington. Sixth gear is 
already well advanced in the achievement 
of many of its objectives including the 
consolidation of the London offices, 
the consolidation of all UK travel and 
subsistence, marketing best practice, 
procurement, key account management 
and centralised functions. 
New London Head Office
A key objective of project Sixth Gear was 
the consolidation of the remaining London 
office locations into an appropriate single 
location bringing Wilmington businesses 
closer together. On 20 June 2017, we 
completed the sale of our Underwood 
Street lease and signed a 10-year lease 
for new premises in the Aldgate area of 
London. The Underwood Street premises 
has served Wilmington well for many years 
but given its modular structure arranged 
over 4 floors it was not consistent with 
our vision and strategic objective of 
encouraging greater collaboration, flexible 
working and the building of a “one 
Wilmington” team. 
The investment and step change in our 
working conditions will undoubtedly 
lead to many benefits both financial and 
operational over time. Initially there will be 
an annual step up in operating costs of 
around £0.9m pa starting from occupation 
in January 2018. However, given the 
disposal proceeds from Underwood 
Street the cash outflow including fit out 
costs and associated tax will be neutral 
for the first 5 years. The Underwood 
Street sale produced a net profit of £6.3m 
which is shown on the face of the income 
statement.
We expect an adjusting operating expense 
in 2017/18 of £1.4m in respect of property 
costs. Included in this item is £0.4m in 
respect of the non-cash write off of the 
remaining property plant and equipment 
in use in existing properties and £1.0m 
of the double running costs covering part 
of the rent free period of the new Aldgate 
premises. 
Exit from Legal practice 
support market 
As previously announced and resulting 
from our decision to focus Wilmington 
around three divisional knowledge areas 
we decided to exit the legal practice 
support markets. We therefore looked 
to dispose of our Ark business which 
contributed £2.8m (£2.6m constant 
currency; 2016: £3.0m) to revenue 
and £0.1m to profit before central 
overhead allocations in 2016/17. The 
five-month sale process to find a new 
home for the Ark business ultimately 
proved unsuccessful so we are closing 
all operations except the US events 
business and some parts of the UK events 
businesses which remain profitable and 
are consistent with our strategy. We have 
entered into consultation with the staff 
affected and redundancy and other related 
costs are expected to come to £0.2m. We 
have also decided to impair the remaining 
associated goodwill and intangible 
fixed assets relating to this investment. 
This impairment is shown as a £2.4m 
impairment charge.

New learning 
management system 
(LMS)
Wilmington has already invested 
significant resource in setting up and 
developing an embryonic programme of 
next generation digital training products 
and learning support systems. During 
2016/17 we set up a dedicated e-learning 
team and we selected Totara© as our 
new learning management system. 
Totara© integrates with other key systems 
such as SalesForce© and our new 
automated marketing system Marketo© 
and provides the end to end platform for 
our all products facilitating an ambitious 
roll out of new digital training courses. 
The market for bespoke digital training 
programmes and other allied products is 
evolving rapidly and we believe it is set 
to grow strongly over the next few years. 
Wilmington, like its larger competitors is 
positioning itself to take advantage and 
is investing in blended digital learning 
solutions taking an increasingly “digital 
first” approach to new training product 
launches. We have identified up to 250 
existing training courses across the Group 
which can be repurposed and restructured 
as blended digital training products; 
learning and building from the established 
pioneering digital training programmes of 
SWAT and AMT and coordinated by the 
newly formed digital learning team. The 
cost of conversion of existing and the 
launch of new courses is likely to see an 
increase in operational costs and working 
capital as investment feeds through. We 
however expect to see many commercial 
advantages including higher adjusted 
EBITA margins in the medium term, 
greater ability to repurpose and repackage 
products across Wilmington communities 
and the exploitation of overseas market 
opportunities. As explained in the 
Chairman’s statement the costs of this 
are included in the expected £0.75m of 
additional costs for 2017/18. 
Acquisitions 
In July 2016 Wilmington acquired SWAT 
Group Limited (‘SWAT’), a leading provider 
of training, and technical compliance 
support to accountancy firms in London 
and the South West of England. SWAT 
sits inside the professional division 
offering training, and technical accounting 
services. The consideration paid was 
an initial cash payment of £2.5m and a 
deferred consideration payment of up to 
£3.0m payable in September 2018 in cash 
subject to SWAT achieving challenging 
profit targets over the two financial years 
ending 30 June 2018.
On 31 January 2017 Wilmington acquired 
HSJ for £16.9m after an adjustment for 
working capital. HSJ is one of the UK’s 
leading health information, insight and 
networking business with a highly-trusted 
brand providing unparalleled penetration 
into the NHS and private vendor space 
through subscription information and 
data products, events and awards 
and marketing solutions. HSJ has a 
growing recurring revenue stream from 
subscriptions and annual events. 
The HSJ business is integral to 
Wilmington’s market leading healthcare 
business significantly enhancing the 
Group’s presence across the UK 
healthcare market. Uniquely, Wilmington 
Healthcare now has a complete UK 
industry presence across both provider/
payer and the private sector in Pharma 
and MedTech and other healthcare 
providers. 
Executive team 
To support our exciting growth strategy, 
we have continued to strengthen our 
executive team with the appointment 
of a senior executive with particular 
experience and a successful track record 
in designing and implementing large scale 
digital learning initiatives to head up our 
Professional division. The integration 
of the Professional division is a priority 
objective and consequence of project 
Sixth Gear which will particularly benefit 
from the key account management, 
common platforms and work flow 
processes which should in turn reflect 
in improving margins over the next few 
years.

Case studies
“Lead with conviction, passion and purpose. 
Give people wings and let them fly, then 
recognise and reward success, while allowing 
room for error without blame.”
Aged 21, Nicola Hurley already managed her own graphics studio, 
working primarily for London-based print consultancies. In 2006 she 
was working for Mercia Group – a leading provider of training support 
services to the accountancy profession in the UK and Ireland – and 
when that year Mercia was acquired by Wilmington, Nicola was the 
first non-accountant to be appointed a Director.
In 2014 Nicola was promoted to Managing Director, and since has 
been instrumental in the drive to move the company firmly into the 
digital era, developing and enhancing its online presence on all 
fronts. Mercia firmly employs technology as an enabler for its clients 
– accountancy businesses ranging in size from sole practitioners to 
top-ten firms. Keeping them competitive is as important as future-
proofing Mercia itself.
Wilmington’s core values feature prominently in Nicola’s approach to 
managing her people. “They mean everything! If you lead by example 
and embed all four values within your team, your business can’t help 
but grow”, she says. “You develop an exciting environment, both 
to work within and to partner with. You become an employer and 
business partner of choice, providing products that clients need and 
which help their businesses to grow.”
Nicola is adamant that Wilmington’s values also encourage team 
members to grow and reach their potential. “Give people wings and 
let them fly” is her mantra – one that both shapes and exemplifies her 
leadership style.
In 2017, Mercia’s overriding priority was to complete the integration 
of SWAT UK Limited, one of Wilmington’s 2017 acquisitions. SWAT’s 
business largely mirrors Mercia’s, with complementary geographical 
coverage of the same target market. Nicola’s objective is to exploit 
business opportunities and to realise efficiencies through a unified set 
of business tools, best-in-class processes and a shared, innovative 
culture.
“We have to become one team, selling an extensive portfolio of 
products that supports our clients through a period of major change in 
the sector”, she insists.
Small wonder then, that her secondary objective is to improve 
Mercia’s use of technology, enlarge its portfolio of online courses 
and broaden its range of publications. These are projects that mean 
recruiting new team members, highly capable people who thrive on 
responsibility, enjoy technical challenges and exceed demanding 
targets.

“In 1993, it would have been difficult to predict 
how successful Semana del Seguro (Inese’s 
Insurance Week conference) would become. 
Today, it attracts delegates from around the 
Spanish-speaking world.”
If there’s anything you need to know about the Spanish insurance 
market, you won’t find anyone better qualified to tell you than Susana 
Pérez, Managing Director of Wilmington’s flagship insurance business 
in Spain. In 1988, after completing a law degree at one of Spain’s 
top universities, she started what was to become a single-company 
career with Inese, then a family-owned business in Madrid; grasping 
the opportunity, she advanced rapidly to become Director of Training 
and Studies.
In 2001, Inese was acquired by Reed Business Information, with 
Susana being appointed to the advisory board and subsequently 
becoming Inese’s Managing Director in 2007. Under her leadership, 
the company has moved from strength to strength, and it joined 
Wilmington’s Risk & Compliance division in 2013.
Inese provides training, information, communication and global 
marketing solutions for the insurance industry in Spanish-speaking 
countries. Refusing to conform to the industry’s reputation for being 
dry and dull, Susana has driven the company to embrace the digital 
revolution in its own operations, and pushes the boundaries with 
unrelenting persistence at Inese’s many industry events, including the 
highly successful Semana del Seguro (Insurance Week) conference.
“I have been part of every Semana del Seguro since its inception 
in 1993”, she says. “Today, it attracts delegates from around the 
Spanish-speaking world. Last year there were nearly 4,000 registered 
visitors and more than 300 speakers.”
Sometimes, it’s hard for people to accept the degree of change that 
Inese is facing; Pérez’ responses include an “innovation competition” 
for her staff, frequent in-house training on the use and benefits of new 
tools and resources, plus regular initiatives to ‘retire’ products and 
services that are no longer relevant. “If we focus only on introducing 
new offerings”, she says, “we are at risk of confusing our customers. 
Moving them away from familiar but outdated products, and 
supporting the transition to new, digital alternatives is essential.”
Alongside with growing business in Spain, Susana finds time to 
progress another of her key strategic tasks – expanding Inese’s 
business into Latin America. “It’s vital”, she says, “that Inese is ready 
to help insurers in these Spanish-speaking countries to accelerate 
digital transformation and to expand market reach.”
Susana accepts that the next decade will probably see even faster 
rates of change in the insurance sector than Inese has experienced 
in the past ten years. But it’s clear that, under her leadership, Inese is 
ready for the challenge.

“We aim to own the information, education and 
intelligence space in healthcare in France and 
a few specific areas internationally.”
Loïc Lebrun is a man for whom actions speak louder than words. 
Described by a former colleague as having “an outstanding ability to 
execute”, Loïc is a finance professional who worked in the aerospace 
and defence industries, before moving in the early 2000s to what was 
then an emerging digital-insights sector for healthcare professionals. 
For the next decade, Loïc broadened his experience in financial, 
sales and general-management roles with a leading international 
healthcare-insight company. He soon recognised the potential of 
premium niche products as a means of attracting and retaining high-
value subscribers who want to be part of special-interest communities 
– a realisation that has driven his work since then.
In 2014, he was appointed the Managing Director of Wilmington’s 
first international acquisition, Agence de Presse Médicale (APM), an 
independent press agency specialising in the healthcare sector in 
France and across Europe. “Unlike many Wilmington businesses, 
which made the transition from print-based models, APM is a digital-
native company – it embraced electronic formats from the day it was 
founded”, Loïc explains.
APM plans to launch two or three new products – typically 
subscription-based niche websites – each year. “The healthcare 
landscape is evolving rapidly and this forces us to rethink our 
approaches continually – which is sometimes difficult, but always 
interesting”, Loïc continues. 
As you would expect from a proven early adopter, there is clear 
evidence of successful innovation at APM; in 2016, it launched 
APMjob.com, an online job board – and the company’s first non-
editorial product. “APM without innovation is unthinkable,” says Loïc. 
“In fact, I’m very comfortable with all Wilmington’s core values as they 
have been guiding my career for many years. My favourite? Without 
doubt, it’s ‘Enabling’, as it’s the key to developing our people.”
APM’s subscribers can continue to rely on the company to set the 
daily news agenda for the European healthcare markets, reflecting 
Loïc‘s deep understanding of the business drivers behind APM’s 
financial outcomes. His keen sense of appreciation for his clients’ 
requirements will surely continue to drive APM’s success – or, to use 
his own words: “I’m just doing something I really enjoy and working 
very hard at it; the rest simply follows.”

“I often say that I am a doer, learning how to 
dream. Challenges give rise to opportunities 
to think differently and to provide insightful 
solutions.”
Growing up in Malaysia, Quin quickly learned that girls are not 
expected to have careers; but rather than discouraging her, this 
realisation spurred her to believe ever more strongly in her potential.
In the early 1990s, backing herself to succeed in a heavily 
male-dominated profession, Quin applied for a junior role in 
PricewaterhouseCoopers’ audit and business-advisory division. 
Selected from hundreds of candidates for one of only twenty 
positions, Quin seized her moment in the sun. “I carried as many 
hard-folder files as my male colleagues, worked at least as diligently 
and even won a gold medal in the national CPA exams”, she recalls.
Quin’s can-do attitude launched a successful accountancy career 
that saw her working in the world’s leading financial centres, including 
Hong Kong, Shanghai, London and Melbourne. She gravitated into 
senior strategic roles that went beyond a typical CFO’s remit, making 
her the ideal candidate when, in 2016, Wilmington sought a business 
leader to deliver the company’s Asia strategy. Where others see 
challenges, Quin sees opportunities: “I often say that I am a doer, 
learning how to dream. Challenges give rise to opportunities to think 
differently and provide insightful solutions, sparking the doer in me 
into action.
“The most exciting challenge we face is expanding Wilmington in 
Asia, against the swelling tide of small players with varying qualities of 
services, with some resorting to price-war tactics. The key to winning 
is to provide unique, high-quality services, setting a consistently 
professional tone; this is Wilmington’s hallmark, differentiating us from 
other players. We succeed by being innovative with our marketing 
programmes, by engaging actively with our clients and by being close 
to the heartbeat of the industry.”
Ten years ago, Quin set herself a simple, but powerful aspiration 
– to create opportunities for people to develop their potential: “At 
that time, I did not have a clear plan how to go about doing that.
