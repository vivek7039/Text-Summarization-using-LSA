 Chief Executive’s review
Aligned for growth
unaffected by the changing environment. 
This is exemplified by our success in 
winning an 11‑year contract from the 
French Ministry of Defence and our 
success in becoming the first non‑US 
company to be selected to provide a 
critical component for a US nuclear 
submarine as part of the £1 billion joint 
US‑UK missile tube programme.
In the UK, we have seen the work 
programmes identified in the 2015 
Strategic Defence and Security Review 
(SDSR) begin to come to market, ensuring 
a healthy pipeline of outsourcing 
opportunities in the provision of 
equipment, through‑life equipment 
support and training over the medium 
term. In May the UK Ministry of Defence 
(MOD) awarded us all four elements of 
a £360 million technical authority and 
equipment support package for both 
the Queen Elizabeth Class (QEC) aircraft 
carriers and Type 45 Destroyers. 
In our nuclear business, the volume 
of the additional work now required 
has led to an ending of the existing 
Magnox contract in 2019. The Nuclear 
Decommissioning Authority (NDA) will 
establish a replacement structure to be 
put in place when the current contract 
ends and we believe that Cavendish 
Nuclear is well positioned to win further 
elements of decommissioning work, 
both on the Magnox estate and in the 
decommissioning of Sellafield, which the 
NDA now estimates will cost a total of 
around £88 billion.
After starting the year as Chief Operating 
Officer, working alongside Peter Rogers 
as part of our managed handover, 
I formally became Chief Executive 
on 1 September 2016. Last autumn 
I oversaw our annual five‑year strategy 
review and update for the first time since 
becoming Chief Executive. It was an 
important moment for me; I was looking 
across the Group to understand where we 
had come from and where we could be 
in five years’ time.
Over the last 15 years, we have pursued 
a highly successful strategy, moving away 
from our origins in manufacturing and 
the power industry to become one of 
the UK’s leading engineering support 
services companies. Our customers see 
us as a trusted partner that helps them 
to manage their complex assets.
We have deep skills and experience in 
the areas of technology, technical training 
and infrastructure. At the same time 
we are familiar with a broad range of 
platforms and assets, and have technical 
agreements in place with all the major 
original equipment manufacturers 
(OEMs). This combination of depth 
and breadth is what makes Babcock’s 
offering so powerful. Wherever there 
are complex assets – whether it’s an 
airbase, a submarine, a vehicle fleet or 
a nuclear plant – we can generate the 
right engineering solutions to support 
our customers.
Today, we use this combination of depth 
and breadth to manage key assets for 
many high‑profile customers in both 
Babcock continues to deliver, with sustained 
underlying growth in revenue, operating profit and 
earnings per share demonstrating the quality of our 
operations and the resilience of the Group’s business. 
Archie Bethel CBE, Chief Executive
Our proven model of providing our 
customers with better capability, reliability 
and availability of their critical assets 
whilst delivering cost savings continues 
to prove successful and we continue to 
experience demand across our markets, 
both in the UK and internationally. With 
clear barriers to entry across many of 
our businesses, we believe we are well 
positioned to continue to grow the 
business, supported by a strong underpin 
of already secured future revenue.
We believe the market dynamics remain 
positive in the sectors in which we have 
deep expertise, both in the UK and 
internationally. There continues to be 
an appetite for increased operational 
and cost efficiencies in the delivery of 
non‑discretionary critical services, and 
for working with a partner who can 
demonstrate a track record of delivery. 
This fundamental requirement of regional 
and national governments and of blue 
chip international customers, appears

the public and private sectors. For all 
of them, our goal is to provide them 
with better availability and capability 
from their critical assets. Clearly, this 
meets a need – in the last 10 years our 
revenue has grown from £500 million 
to £5 billion today.
We’ve come a long way, but I believe we 
can go even further. One of my key roles 
is to test the robustness of our strategy 
and to be sure that the organisation has 
the capacity and capability to exploit the 
growth opportunities before us. When 
I look at the size and shape the business 
could be in five years’ time I believe the 
strategy is robust and deliverable but we 
need to make a fairly simple realignment 
of our internal divisional structure to give 
us a solid base to enable us to grow as we 
believe we can over the next five years.
Where are we going?
By 2022 we aim to be by far the biggest, 
and most successful, engineering 
services business in the UK, and one 
of the best in the world. I want to see 
us deliver top‑level returns for our 
shareholders, whilst having grown our 
revenues significantly. We plan to grow 
internationally even faster than we will 
in the UK, and in five years’ time I expect 
around 30% of our revenue will come 
from outside the UK.
Expanding our international business is 
a priority. To achieve our target we will 
double the size of our global business in 
the next five years. As well as continuing 
to grow in our established markets 
in Australia and South Africa, we’ll be 
building up our business in Italy, France, 
Canada and Spain, so that they too can 
become standalone countries. In all these 
six core countries we will be seeking 
opportunities in both the defence and 
civil sectors.
This, combined with continued growth 
in the UK, will mean expanding our 
workforce. There will be new career 
opportunities opening up in the UK and 
internationally as we grow. At the same 
time we’ll also be investing in employee 
development and training.
In Technology there will be exciting 
developments too. I want Babcock to 
be seen as the benchmark for technical 
innovation within engineering services. In 
a world where the speed of technological 
change is rapidly advancing, we need to 
stay abreast of developments and utilise 
new capability to add new dimensions 
to how we support customers. We need 
to ask ourselves questions such as ‘How 
could we service a new generation of 
iFrigates?’ We have already started up this 
curve. The challenge of the next five years 
is to be ahead of the curve and develop 
technology solutions that really help 
our customers.
So, to sum up, we have a strategy where 
in five years I want to see us have a 
significant presence in six core countries, 
expand our technology capability, 
continue to grow our revenues, provide 
good returns and employ substantially 
more people. So I need to make sure 
we have the structures, systems, 
processes and people to support that 
level of complex growth, both in the 
UK and internationally.
How will we get there?
We have a winning formula of depth and 
breadth, and that’s not going to change.
We understand complicated 
infrastructure and operations and the 
regulations involved, and how we can 
make critical assets work better for 
customers. We have strong capabilities 
in design, procurement, logistics, quality 
assurance and inspection, construction 
and implementation. And we have a 
solid base of customers who confirm 
that when we say we are trusted to 
deliver, we mean it.
But the depth and breadth of our offering 
brings its own problems when we are 
trying to win new business. How can we 
bring focus and clarity to the discussion 
when the problems and solutions are 
inherently complex? We’ve made a lot 
of progress internationally in the last two 
years, but I believe that our structure was 
holding us back.
We need to have an organisational 
structure that supports our ambitious 
growth efforts – that makes it easy for 
us to put together powerful, targeted 
solutions to overcome the problems 
faced by potential customers. That is 
why from 1 April 2017 we simplified 
our organisational structure: realigning 
our divisions into four sectors supported 
by four cross‑cutting capabilities 
including a new Global Growth 
and Operations organisation.
Let me start with the realignment. 
Overseas we sell our capabilities, not our 
UK 75% Europe 9% Rest of world 16%
21 Babcock International Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s review continued
internal organisational structure. We need 
to remove unnecessary complexity and 
move to a customer‑facing structure so 
that people can easily understand what 
we are offering. Therefore I decided to 
realign our organisation around four 
sectors: Marine, Land, Aviation and 
Cavendish Nuclear.
Bringing our services together under 
these four sectors has many advantages.
First, it will enable us to tell a much 
simpler and clearer story to potential 
customers about the capabilities we 
are offering.
Secondly, it will bring commercial and 
military operations together in each 
sector, so that like‑minded people can 
more easily collaborate, share knowledge, 
cross‑sell and cross‑fertilise ideas.
And thirdly, each of these sectors will 
take its rightful place as a leading player 
in its marketplace. Land at £1.8 billion 
and Marine at £1.9 billion will be some 
of the biggest players in the UK. Aviation 
at just under £0.9 billion will be the 
biggest aviation engineering business in 
the UK outside the OEMs and airlines, and 
Cavendish Nuclear at over £0.6 billion 
will be the largest nuclear engineering 
services player in the UK. This realignment 
will give us valuable brand recognition 
and credibility.
As well as the four sectors, the new 
platform will be strengthened by 
four cross‑cutting capabilities that 
will work across all the sectors: 
Technology, Training, Infrastructure 
and Global Growth.
In Technology, innovation will be an 
area of continuing focus, as we work 
to stay abreast of opportunities that 
emerge through new technological 
developments. I have asked Jon Hall, 
Managing Director, Technology, to 
form a team that will work across all 
sectors to produce a technology growth 
strategy that will meet the needs of 
all the sectors as they grow, as well 
as identifying new opportunities for 
technology‑driven growth.
Training will remain fundamental to 
supporting our offering and will be an 
important element in all our sectors. Here 
I have asked John Davies to come up with 
a strategy that will link best practices and 
tie in with Technology to identify new 
technological ways to deliver training, 
such as simulation and virtual reality.
Infrastructure, including our dockyards at 
Devonport and Rosyth, will continue to 
be a main driver for all four sectors.
The fourth cross‑cutting capability, 
Global Growth, will play a vital role in 
enabling our ambitious international 
growth strategy. Building on the 
successful work of Bill Tame and the 
International Board over the last two 
years, we are strengthening this capability 
by creating a new Global Growth and 
Operations organisation.
The Global Growth organisation will 
have two main roles: driving business 
development, and linking the in‑country 
teams with the UK sectors to ensure that 
the sectors provide the support required 
to win and implement contracts. It will 
function as a bridge to connect our 
international teams with the four sectors 
in the UK.
Driving business development will mean 
ensuring in‑country teams understand 
Babcock’s strengths in each of the 
sectors, guiding them to find customers 
and opportunities, feeding in reference 
data from satisfied customers, and 
building a pipeline of opportunities 
that are of interest to the Company.
Linking the countries and the UK sectors 
will enable our overseas operations to 
draw expertise and domain knowledge 
from the sectors based in the UK and 
from each other, supporting both the bid 
and its implementation. For example, the 
Global Growth organisation will assess 
the resources required for the project, 
identify which resources will need to be 
brought in from the sectors, and manage 
the technicalities of moving people 
around the world and deploying them 
in other countries.
To carry out these two tasks effectively, 
we are embedding business development 
people from each sector in the new 
Global Growth organisation. This will 
create a formal, reliable link between 
the countries and the sectors, so that they 
can work effectively together to win and 
implement new international contracts 
and ultimately build autonomous 
country teams in all six core countries.
With this new platform – the four 
sectors, the cross‑cutting capabilities 
and the Global Growth organisation 
– I am confident that we will be in a 
strong position to support our five‑year 
growth plan.
Outlook
We believe that the revenue visibility 
provided by our order book and near 
term bid pipeline, together with the 
strong pipeline of future opportunities 
in the longer term tracking pipeline, 
offers continued prospects for growth. 
We have identified opportunities across 
all of our core markets, and believe 
that the realignment of the business, 
which brings us closer to our customers, 
both in the UK and internationally, 
will enable us to continue to identify 
opportunities to further develop our 
business. The Board therefore remains 
confident that the Group will continue 
to generate sustainable growth over the 
coming years.
Following the realignment of the 
business, reporting for 2016/17 reflects 
the divisional structure in place through 
the financial year, but future outlooks 
reflect the new sectors, and can be seen 
on pages 24 and 25 of this document.

Public bodies and blue 
chip customers
Our customers tend to be 
government departments, public 
bodies, highly regulated industries 
or blue chip companies that own 
large, strategically important assets 
or infrastructure. We encourage our 
customers to partner with us and 
to build long‑term relationships.
Customer focused 
long‑term relationships
We place great emphasis on doing 
the right thing for our customers. 
We listen and seek to be flexible 
and responsive to their needs. We 
work collaboratively, often through 
long‑term partnerships or alliances, 
to ensure we understand their 
priorities and align our objectives.
Integrated engineering 
and technical expertise
We are able to integrate a broad 
range of engineering and technical 
expertise to provide services that 
are complex, critical and bespoke. 
We manage the interface between 
all these activities to provide full 
operational outcomes and help 
to take risk from our customers.
Balancing risk and reward
We mainly operate through 
long‑term, integrated output‑based 
contracts. We believe this 
approach creates a commercial 
framework which fairly balances 
risk and reward between us 
and our customers. Target 
cost contracts incentivise us to 
remove cost via a pain‑share/
gain‑share mechanism.
Excellent health and 
safety record
We never compromise on health 
and safety and expect all our 
sectors to deliver a market‑leading 
safety performance. We believe all 
our employees and others working 
on or visiting our operations should 
be able to return home safe and 
well at the end of the working day.
