4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT
Chief Executive’s Review
The 2017 financial results represent another year 
of healthy, profitable organic growth.
Performance in 2017
The North American business, which 
comprises 97% of Group revenue, 
continued to strengthen its position in 
the US and Canadian markets. Revenue 
growth over prior year was 12%, compared 
to estimated total industry growth of 
about 3%. Revenue growth in the second 
half of the year was 14%, compared to 
11% in the first half, in keeping with 
the phasing of marketing initiatives.
Reported revenue growth for the UK 
business was up 11% over prior year. In 
base currency the growth rate was 16%, 
outpacing that of the UK market and 
indicative of a strengthening customer file.
In total 1,185,000 orders – each customised 
and carrying an “on-time or free” 
guarantee – were processed in the year. 
Orders from new customers were up 5% 
over 2016, with more than 252,000 new 
customers acquired. Orders from existing 
customers were up 16%, as retention 
rates remained strong and consistent.
Our organic growth is driven through 
disciplined investment in innovative, data-
driven marketing. In 2017, online marketing 
spend continued to grow at a faster rate 
than the overall marketing budget, although 
our offline activities grew year-over-year 
as well. Our customer retention strategy 
was underpinned by our unique Blue Box™ 
marketing programme, which continues to 
evolve to support a growing customer file. 
Revenue per marketing dollar was $5.67 in 
2017 compared to $5.77 in 2016. This was 
in line with our expectations for the year, 
and was consistent with our targets for 
balancing revenue growth and profitability.

Chief Executive Officer
Underlying operating profit, excluding Head 
Office expenses, increased over prior year 
by 8%. Operating margin percentage at this 
level was 7.27% versus 7.57% in the prior 
year due principally to increased investment 
in marketing, which was 14% higher than 
2016. Gross margin percentage was slightly 
lower than prior year, but remains broadly 
stable. Selling costs and other overheads in 
the trading businesses rose at a rate lower 
than the increase in revenue, providing 
some gearing effect from the fixed or 
semi-fixed elements in these expenses.
Head Office costs fell by 22% compared 
to 2016. The primary cause of this year-
on-year change was not events in 2017, 
rather it reflects losses on forward currency 
contracts after the Brexit referendum 
which were booked in the prior year 
comparative. There has been no change of 
any substance in the structure and activities 
of the central function. Overall, the Group 
operating margin percentage for 2017 
was 6.79% compared to 6.87% in 2016.
For the tenth year in a row, the North 
American business was named a top 
medium sized workplace in the USA. The UK 
business is accredited by Investors in People. 
A strong and healthy culture is central to 
our success. Evidence of the importance of 
a strong culture was on full display during 
parts of the third and fourth quarter of 
2017, as our US team handled disruption 
caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma with 
determination and professionalism, caring 
for customers and working seamlessly with 
suppliers who were impacted by the storms. 
We are proud of their efforts every day.  07

Looking ahead
We have an attractive opportunity to achieve 
significant, profitable growth by expanding 
our presence in markets that remain 
fragmented and largely addressable through 
our direct marketing model. The continued 
evolution and diversification of our 
marketing portfolio should allow us to drive 
further sustained revenue growth much in 
the same way that the addition of online 
activities complemented our catalogue 
marketing activities many years ago.
The second half of 2017 saw our first 
investment into testing elements of 
a new component to our marketing 
strategy, designed to increase the 
overall awareness of the 4imprint 
brand amongst our target audience. 
This relatively small initial investment 
was aimed at providing important 
insights to help inform the direction of 
a broader evolution of our strategy that 
we will begin to implement in 2018. 
We expect the careful cultivation and 
development of this brand awareness 
component of our marketing portfolio 
to be a complementary driver of future 
growth in 2018 and beyond. We will employ 
a combination of different marketing 
techniques, including traditional broadcast 
media and the expansion of our advertising 
presence in digital media. A budget of 
around $7m has been allocated to this 
project in 2018. This new initiative will 
represent incremental investment; it will 
not be funded through re-allocation of 
resources away from our existing, proven 
marketing engine which continues to be 
an effective growth generator. Therefore 
we anticipate an investment phase during 
2018 as we apply our familiar and proven 
“test, read, adjust” approach to rolling out 
this new component of our strategy. As a 
result we expect that 2018 operating profit 
is likely to be flat against 2017, reflecting 
the longer investment period that this 
type of marketing typically requires.
This is an evolution of our previous financial 
strategy of organic revenue growth subject 
to maintaining broadly constant operating 
margin percentage; it does not represent a 
wholesale change in direction or philosophy. 
Rather, it is a measured investment back 
into the business to diversify our marketing 
programme in a way that fundamentally 
strengthens the business for the future. 
We fully expect profitability to remain 
healthy and the business to remain 
highly cash generative as the benefits 
are felt over the next several years.
As a measure of our confidence in the 
Group’s growth strategy we have set a 
new target of reaching $1bn of revenue 
by 2022. 2018 will be an exciting year for 
the Group as we evolve our established 
and effective marketing platform in 
pursuit of our strategic objective of market 
leadership driving organic growth.
