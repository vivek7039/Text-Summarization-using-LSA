 iomart Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Chairman's Statement
7
We have once again seen another year of excellent performance for our shareholders. Not only have we maintained our 
relative level of organic growth in our Cloud Services segment, our Easyspace segment has also returned to organic growth 
after declining a little last year. 
Both of those elements of organic growth plus the acquisition of Cristie during the year, which we have allocated to a new Non-
recurring Revenue segment, together with the full year contributions of SystemsUp and United Hosting has meant we have 
maintained our overall level of revenue growth for the year. In May, after the end of our financial year we purchased Dediserve 
and we believe that there will be other opportunities to allow us to continue to add to our organic growth through acquisition.
We have again enjoyed a substantial increase in profitability over the year, driven by that organic and acquisitive revenue 
growth.
All of this progress is a result of a great deal of hard work by our executives and staff and I thank them all on behalf of the Board 
and the shareholders for their efforts over the year.
Sarah Haran, who has served as an executive director of iomart throughout the time the Group has been listed on AIM, decided 
to step down from the Board at the end of this financial year. She has given many years of loyal and valuable service to the 
Group and on behalf of all shareholders I thank her warmly for her service.
After nearly 6 years of first class commitment and service, Crawford Beveridge has chosen not to stand for re-election as 
Non-Executive Director at our forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Both personally and on behalf of everyone connected 
with the Group, I want to thank him for his valuable contribution to the development of iomart over the years. The search for 
a replacement for Crawford is at an advanced stage and we expect to be in a position to make an announcement about this 
in the near future.
As we indicated in our trading update which was issued at the end of March we have decided to improve our dividend policy 
to reflect the ongoing growth that we have been delivering, the level of cash we generate, and the confidence we continue to 
have in our future prospects. We had previously committed to paying up to 25% of our adjusted diluted earnings per share by 
way of dividend and last year our pay-out ratio was 22%. We have now increased the upper limit of dividend pay-out to 40% 
and the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 6.0p per share on 6 September 2017 to shareholders on the register on 
11 August 2017, based on an ex-dividend date of 10 August 2017. This represents an increase of 90% over the dividend last 
year and equivalent to a pay-out ratio of 35% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continue to offer shareholders the 
option to participate in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) as an alternative to receiving cash. Details of the DRIP scheme will 
be distributed with the annual accounts in due course. 
We have started the new financial year in a strong position and I look forward to another exciting year of growth with 
considerable confidence.
