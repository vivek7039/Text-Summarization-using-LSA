 08 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
In what is expected to be my final letter to 
BGEO Group shareholders I would like to  
talk about three subjects:
1. The outstanding performance of the Group
2. Simplicity is a key ingredient to our future 
success, which drove our difficult decision 
to demerge
3. Our determined and high-achieving Board 
PERFORMANCE
BGEO Group delivered another extremely  
strong performance during 2017 that resulted in 
record profit for the year of GEL 463 million, and 
earnings per share of GEL 11.61, an increase of 
11.5% year-on-year. Group revenues increased 
by 23.7% to GEL 1.1 billion. Book value per 
share at the end of 2017 was GEL 65.22,  
up 15.2% year-on-year. This reflects excellent 
performance from our Banking Business as  
well as strong momentum and strategic delivery 
from our Investment Businesses, which were 
supported by Georgia’s strong macroeconomic 
performance and business outlook.
In the Banking Business, 2017 was 
characterised by strong franchise growth in 
Retail Banking operations, particularly in the 
fourth quarter. This reflected the continued 
strong performance of our retail business in  
all segments and an increase in retail lending 
during the year of 29.3%. In addition, in 3Q17 
we completed our three-year programme to 
reduce concentration risk in our Corporate 
Bank and consequently started to deliver 
corporate lending growth in the last quarter  
of the year. Loan yields have remained stable, 
and net interest margins have therefore  
stayed robust at 7.3%. Costs have remained  
well-controlled, whilst ensuring continued 
investment in building an increasingly strong 
customer franchise. The Banking Business  
cost of risk ratio in 2017 was 2.2%, in line  
with our medium-term cost of risk expectations, 
and a significant reduction from 2.7% in 2016. 
In addition, we have continued to improve our 
asset quality and provisions coverage ratios. 
The Return on Average Equity in the Banking 
Business continued to improve, and stood  
at 25.2% for the year, and 27.8% in the  
fourth quarter. 
We have again delivered on all of our key 
strategic priorities. 2017 revenue growth of 
17.5% was particularly supported by strong 
Retail Banking franchise growth, where revenue 
increased by 24.4% and customer lending 
continues to grow at more than 20% per  
annum. This offset the anticipated decline in the 
Corporate Investment Banking loan portfolio, as 
we wound down the banking relationship with a 
small number of significant corporate borrowers, 
earlier in 2017. Importantly, this helped us to 
make strong progress in reducing concentration 
risk in the Corporate Investment Banking, and  
we lowered the concentration of our top ten 
corporate borrowers to only 10.7% of our lending 
portfolio. We have now exceeded our targeted 
rebalancing of the retail/corporate portfolio mix to 
further improve the return profile of the Banking 
Business. Retail Banking now represents 68%  
of the Bank’s customer lending and Corporate 
Investment Banking represents 32%.
In addition to the strong retail lending growth, 
Retail Banking made strong progress in 
implementing its customer-centric approach 
with the launch of its new loyalty reward 
programme Plus+ in July 2017, and continued 
investment in digital growth. Our product to 
client ratio also improved from 2.0 to 2.2 during 
the second half of 2017. In July 2017, we won 
the exclusive right to modernise public transport 
payment system in Tbilisi and continue as the 
sole provider of the Tbilisi Metro’s payment 
support systems for the next ten years. In 
addition, Solo, our premium banking brand, has 
continued to deliver strong growth momentum, 
with customer numbers increasing to 32,104, 
up 66.6% over the last 12 months. Solo is on 
track to achieving its target of 40,000 Solo 
clients by the end of 2018.
The improving growth and strength of the 
Georgian economy continue to support asset 
quality. In addition to the reduction to 2.2%  
in the cost of risk ratio mentioned above, we 
were able to reduce the ratio of NPLs to Gross 
Loans, which fell from 4.2% in December 2016, 
to 3.8% in December 2017. Our NPL coverage 
ratio also improved – from 86.7% at the end of 
December 2016, to 92.7% at the end of 2017.
The Group’s capital and funding position  
remain strong, with capital being held both  
in the regulated Banking Business and at the 
holding company level. At the end of 2017, 
liquid assets totalling GEL 310 million were  
held at the holding company level. Within the 
Banking Business, the NBG (Basel II) Tier 1 
Capital Adequacy ratio increased by 120 basis 
points to 10.3% during the year, reflecting both 
the continued de-dollarisation of the Banking 
Business lending portfolio and the Banking 
Business’ high return on average equity and 
internal capital generation. 
The National Bank of Georgia is currently  
in the process of transitioning to Basel III 
standards, and introduced new capital adequacy 
requirements in December 2017. On the basis of 
new regulation, the NBG (Basel III) Tier 1 capital 
adequacy ratio was 12.4% at 31 December 
2017, compared to a new minimum Tier 1 
capital requirement of 9.9%, which is expected 
to increase to 11.4% on 31 December 2018. 
Bank of Georgia has strong capital ratios and 
high levels of internal capital generation. As a 
result, the transition to Basel III is not expected 
to affect the Bank’s growth expectations or 
existing dividend payout policy.
The Group’s Investment Business continued 
to deliver strong growth and performance, with 
EBITDA growing 55.7% year-on-year, and profit 
before non-recurring items and income tax, 
including discontinued operations, increasing 
by 21.4% over the same period. 
We now expect that, in line with our planned 
exit strategy for the business, it is highly 
probable that the Group will own less than  
a 50% stake in Georgia Healthcare Group 
(“GHG”) at the end of 2018. As a result, GHG is 
now reported under “discontinued operations” 
in the Group’s consolidated income statement. 
Within the business, GHG delivered a year of 
strong progress towards its planned investment 
and business roll-out in all key areas of the 
Georgian healthcare system. GHG delivered net 
revenues of GEL 745.7 million during the year, 
an increase of 76.0%, reflecting a combination 
of solid organic growth and the impact of

acquisitions. The healthcare services EBITDA 
margin continues to be strong at 26.4%, 
notwithstanding the dilutive effect of the 
significant roll-out of the two major hospital 
renovations – Tbilisi Referral Hospital and Deka 
– and the ongoing roll-out of a nationwide  
chain of polyclinics (outpatient clinics). In the 
pharmacy business, we have made significant 
progress towards the integration of our two 
recently acquired businesses, whilst avoiding 
any significant business disruption. As a result, 
the EBITDA margin of 8.6% for the year has 
already exceeded our target of a margin of 
“more than 8%”.
Our water utility and energy business, GGU, 
continued to focus on improving efficiencies in 
the water utility business and delivered a 6.1% 
year-on-year growth in revenues during the 
year, whilst achieving a 52% EBITDA margin. 
GGU has also continued to achieve efficiencies 
in its own energy consumption, to free up 
electricity for third-party sales, and has started 
a number of investments in additional capacity 
for electricity generation with the goal to 
establish a renewable energy platform. During 
2017, GGU commenced construction of one  
of two planned hydro power plants targeting 
c.100MW of additional capacity over the next 
few years.
Our real estate business, m
2
 Real Estate, 
continues to demonstrate its strong execution 
skills to unlock value in the real estate 
development business. During 2017, m
2
  
sold 629 apartments with a total sales value  
of US$ 49.1 million, in addition to further 
increasing its portfolio of yielding assets.  
In addition, the real estate business continued  
to execute on its strategy of developing 1,000 
hotel rooms by the end of 2020. In the fourth 
quarter of 2017, we acquired the shell of 
approximately 100-room hotel, and in February 
2018 we launched a 152-room Ramada  
Encore hotel in central Tbilisi. As part of our 
“asset light” strategy, m
2
 signed its largest  
ever franchise agreement to construct and 
develop a residential complex under the m
2
 
brand name on a third-party land plot in a 
densely populated Tbilisi suburb. Additionally, 
m
2
’s construction arm gained its first major 
third-party construction agreement to construct 
the shell and core of a new shopping mall and 
business centre in Tbilisi’s Saburtalo district. 
These developments underpin an extremely 
successful year for the real estate business, 
and provide significant growth potential over 
the next few years.
Our property and casualty insurance business, 
Aldagi, continues development of a strong 
portfolio of new products, supporting 24.6% 
year-on-year growth in net earned premiums 
during 2017 and Aldagi’s position as the  
clear market leader in the fast-developing 
Georgian P&C insurance market. Over the  
last few months, Aldagi has also enhanced  
its distribution capabilities by signing major third-
party partnership agreements with two Georgian 
banks – Liberty Bank and Credo Bank – which 
will support the further diversification of Aldagi’s 
multi-channel distribution network. These 
contracts would not have materialised had  
it not been for the proposed demerger. 
Our beverage business, Teliani, increased its 
revenues by 102.5% year-on-year, continued to 
diversify its distribution portfolio and launched 
its mainstream beer and lemonade production 
during 2017. 
The Group Board expects to recommend a 
regular annual dividend for 2017 totalling c.GEL 
120 million. This is in the range of our regular 
dividend payout ratio target of 25-40% paid 
from the Banking Business profits. Since 2010, 
the Group has grown its annual dividend per 
share by 40% CAGR on a GEL basis, and by 
32% CAGR on a Dollar basis. If the expected 
demerger is successfully implemented as 
planned, it is intended that Bank of Georgia 
Group PLC (the then new parent company  
of the Banking Business), will instead, shortly 
after the demerger is completed, declare and 
pay a dividend in a similar aggregate amount  
to shareholders then on the record. In the  
event that the demerger is for any reason not 
completed it is intended, subject to shareholder 
approval, that the Board would implement the 
payment of this dividend, which would represent 
a payment of GEL 3.1 per share, payable in 
British Pounds Sterling at the prevailing rate,  
a 19.2% increase over the 2016 dividend.
In addition to the regular annual dividend paid 
to shareholders, US$5.0 million was returned 
to shareholders by way of the buyback and 
cancellation of 115,608 shares during 2017,  
as part of the existing Board approved US$50 
million buyback and cancellation programme. 
During 2017, the Group Employee Benefits 
Trust also purchased shares in the market 
totalling US$34.1 million.
SIMPLICITY
In July 2017, the Group announced its intention 
to demerge BGEO Group PLC into two 
separate London-listed businesses: a banking 
business, Bank of Georgia Group PLC, and an 
investment business, Georgia Capital PLC. On 
12 February 2018, the Group announced that 
the Board has approved the implementation of 
the demerger, which is subject to shareholder 
approval at a General Meeting expected to be 
held in April 2018. The demerger is expected to 
complete before the end of June 2018. The 
main benefit of the demerger is to simplify the 
structure, which in turn will enable the Boards 
and management teams of the respective 
businesses greater focus on strategy setting 
and execution. It was not an easy decision to 
separate the Group, but simplicity will bring so 
much benefit that it has clearly out-weighed all 
the potential downsides. 
In its final year before the forthcoming 
demerger, and supported by the continued 
macroeconomic performance of Georgia, 
BGEO Group has delivered a record breaking 
performance in terms of profitability and growth. 
Growth and return momentum is there for both 
the Banking and the Investment Businesses. 
BOARD
Our Board’s role in the success of the  
Group may not always be apparent to our 
shareholders or the broader community – but  
it is pivotal. Each Board member’s dedication, 
vision, rationalism and collaboration have made 
an important contribution to our development 
into the world-class institution we have 
become. Special thanks go to Neil Janin,  
our Chairman whose leadership of the board 
and active involvement in strategy setting and 
mentoring of senior management has been 
critical in the success of our Group. The  
good news is that Neil will continue to be  
the Chairman of Bank of Georgia. We have 
continued our commitment to a strong and 
independent governance structure and have 
managed to put first-class independent Boards 
and management teams in both businesses 
and I am confident that under the proposed 
governance structure following the demerger 
both companies independently will prosper 
even more and will continue their excellent 
recent track record for many years to come.
In what is expected to be my final letter to 
shareholders, I would like to thank you for  
your continuous support and loyalty. I have  
very much enjoyed meeting you on roadshows, 
which served as very good guidance for me 
personally. I have learned a great deal over  
the past 13 years of being an executive of  
a publicly listed company and believe, with  
your help, a lot more learning will follow in the 
years ahead. I am very much looking forward  
to meeting you to discuss our strategy in my  
new capacity as CEO of the first publicly listed 
investment company from the region. 
Sincerely yours,
Irakli Gilauri, 
Chief Executive Officer
