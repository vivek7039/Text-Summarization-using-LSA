The group adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with effect from 1 April 2005. The comparative data for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been restated accordingly. IAS 32,
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ (IAS 32) and IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ (IAS 39) were adopted with effect from 1 April 2005 and the
comparative data does not reflect the effect of these standards. Amounts in the years prior to the year ended 31 March 2005 are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). Information prepared under IFRS is not directly comparable with that prepared under UK GAAP.
For the purposes of US reporting requirements applicable to first time adopters of IFRS, BT hereby incorporates by reference from its Annual report on Form 20-F for 2005 the five year financial
summary on pages 23 to 24 thereof, the discussion of the 2005 financial year on pages 26 to 143 in the Financial review section thereof and the Financial statements and supporting notes on
pages 72 to 122 thereof.
a
A number of measures quoted in this Annual Report are ‘non-GAAP’ measures. The directors believe these measures provide a more meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group and are
consistent with the way financial performance is measured by management. These include EBITDA and profit before specific items, earnings per share before specific items, net debt and free cash
flow. The rationale for using non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS indicator are provided on pages 28, 65, 83 and 84.
b
Dividends per share represents the dividend proposed in respect of the relevant financial year.
c
Amounts presented in respect of the years ended 31 March 2004, 2003 and 2002 are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. UK GAAP is not directly comparable with IFRS.
