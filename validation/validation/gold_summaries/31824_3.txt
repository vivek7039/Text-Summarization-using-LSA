 Strategic Report 
Chairman's Introduction
ULTIMATE 
PRODUCTS
A Year of Substantial Progress
I am very pleased to introduce the first annual 
report for the Group as a listed business. The 
year has been one of substantial progress and 
significant change, with a number of exciting 
developments taking place across the business, 
some of which are mentioned in the Chief 
Executive’s Review.
Performance & Strategy
The Group delivered a strong financial 
performance during the year. This was achieved 
despite a backdrop of continuing economic 
turbulence. The business, along with many 
others, faced a number of challenges including 
significant cost inflation, the devaluation of 
Sterling against major currencies and the 
well documented uncertainty around Brexit 
negotiations following the General Election. 
Ultimate Products' performance is attributable 
to a number of factors:  a superb range of 
great value core products, new and innovative 
products, an excellent supply chain, a strong 
and extensive customer base of leading 
retailers and, not least, the committed and 
talented colleagues that we employ who 
deliver our company values every day. We 
believe that we offer all of our customers the 
best possible products with an overall service 
level that is second to none. This powerful 
combination is important to customer focused 
businesses that require certainty in value, 
quality and critically, supply.
Over recent years, the Group’s strategy has 
been to develop a portfolio of brands focused 
on the growing market of value-led consumer 
goods for the home. The success of this strategy 
is demonstrated by the growth of the business 
since FY 14 and in particular the financial metrics 
for the last financial year.
Our strategy has four key pillars: 
1. growing our business with 
 discount retailers; 
2. increasing our penetration in 
 UK supermarkets; 
3. expansion via online channels; and 
4. international growth.
The Board is confident that our relentless focus 
on these objectives will drive long term growth 
for the business and its stakeholders.
Initial Public Offering
On 6 March 2017, the Group was admitted 
to the premium segment of the Official 
List of the Financial Conduct Authority 
and to trading on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange plc. This was a 
significant step forward for the development 
of the business and a substantial achievement 
for the management team and staff. We believe  
that our listed company status provides the 
right platform for the future growth of the 
business and further enhances our reputation 
with customers and supplier partners. We

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
recognise that the future prospects of the 
business are reliant on both retaining our very 
best talent and recruiting new colleagues to 
the business that have the same potential and 
attitude as our very best. Accordingly, we are 
creating development programmes for rising 
stars and have already put in place various 
incentive schemes that reward outperformance. 
Dividend
The Board is committed to a progressive 
dividend policy, with an intention to distribute 
50 % of the Group’s adjusted profit after tax. 
A final dividend is recommended of 3.495 p 
per share to give a total dividend of 5.115 p per 
share for the full year.
The final dividend is payable on 30 January 2018 
to shareholders on the register on 5 January 2018.
Summary
The Board fully believes that our strategy of 
developing and building a portfolio of brands 
that are focused on mass-market and value-led 
consumer goods for the home will create further 
value for all our stakeholders, and we are excited 
by the Group’s long-term growth prospects.
Since the year end, trading conditions have 
become more challenging with retailers 
taking longer to commit to orders or delaying 
purchasing decisions for the current year. This 
reflects uncertainty in the market place and in 
particular the effect of wage deflation and 
food inflation on consumers. Whilst we 
believe that in time we will see a return to more 
traditional trading patterns our view is that, in 
the short term, many UK retailers will continue 
to be cautious on ordering non-food inventory.
On behalf of all of our stakeholders, I would 
like to thank all of our colleagues for their 
commitment and hard work over the past year.
