 8 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
1.0 Strategic Review
Chairman’s Statement
I am delighted to present results which show 
continued good progress with revenues, 
earnings, and net cash all significantly improved 
compared with the previous year. 
Strategy
The Group has continued to follow the path 
which led to the successful turnaround of 
the business in 2016, namely concentrating 
its activities on point-of-care diagnostics 
and the related central laboratory reagents 
business, while reducing costs and simplifying 
the business. In the first half, we closed our 
manufacturing site in Poland and transferred 
activities to our main European hub in Barleben, 
Germany. This led to a small number of 
redundancies, and we thank those affected and 
wish them well for the future. As a result, the 
number of sites used by the Group has reduced 
from a peak of twelve to seven, of which four 
are in Europe, two in the USA and one in China. 
While we are not currently planning further 
closures, our efforts to improve efficiency and 
therefore reduce costs continue.
After considerable deliberation and discussion 
with our professional advisors, we were unable 
to proceed with our plan to split out the central 
laboratory business in a tax efficient manner.
sTNFR venture
Subsequent to the year end, on 11 January 
2018 the Group announced its intention to 
spin-out its sTNFR biomarker technology into 
a separate entity, Renalytix AI, Inc., which has 
been registered in the USA. sTNFR1/2 (Soluble 
Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptors 1 and 
2) are novel biomarkers used in combination 
with artificial intelligence to identify which 
diabetes patients are at the highest risk of 
progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) 
potentially leading to End Stage Renal Disease 
(ESRD). Plans for the entity are at an early stage 
and discussions with partners are continuing. 
Capital changes
The Directors have taken a number of actions 
during the year to create distributable reserves 
and to reduce the number of actual and potential 
shares in issue. In June 2017, 21.6m share 
options which had been granted to employees 
and others were cancelled at the election of the 
holders, in return for payments totalling £1.5m. 
In September 2017, court and shareholder 
approval were received for a capital reduction, 
allowing us to create distributable reserves 
through the write-off of the Company’s share 
premium account, and to buy back up to 15% of 
the Company’s ordinary shares. Subsequently, 
a total of 6.7m shares have been cancelled. As 
a result of these actions, the total number of 
potential shares has reduced by nearly 6%. 
Results overview
The Chief Executive’s and Finance Director’s 
statements contain a review of the year and an 
overview of the financial performance of the 
Group.
Board
All of the Board members have served 
throughout the year. Non-executive Directors 
have continued to waive their standard 
director’s fees, however as each has performed 
considerable amounts of work for the Group in 
addition to their duties as directors, they have 
been paid an appropriate bonus.
Outlook
Trading in 2017 has been positive and this has 
continued into the early part of 2018. Trading is 
in line with management expectations.
