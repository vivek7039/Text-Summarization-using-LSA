 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017 16
I am delighted to introduce my first Chief Executive’s review. I am 
proud to be leading a business that has clients at the heart of how it 
operates. We are a market leader, looking after the wealth of nearly 
a million individuals; a huge responsibility at a time when people 
need more help than ever in managing their savings and 
investments. We take this responsibility very seriously. Our 
expertise and client service are well respected and I believe the 
strength and scale of our business means we can continue to 
develop its offering to the benefit of all our stakeholders in 
the future. 
2017 highlights 
It was a busy year at Hargreaves Lansdown, providing us with 
a strong foundation on which to build future growth. We have 
broadened our offering, adding products such as the Lifetime ISA 
and two new HL Select funds, launched our new mobile apps, 
increased our digital marketing presence and continued to grow our 
execution-only stockbroking market share. We added record net 
new business (NNB) of £6.9 billion, introduced 118,000 net new 
active clients to our services and grew our active client base by a 
further 14% to 954,000. All achieved while maintaining our client 
service at the high standards to which we aspire to. 
118,000 net new active clients
The importance of offering a wide range of services to clients was 
made clear during 2017 . Brexit proved a drag on investor confidence 
and NNB in the first part of the year, although we still increased our 
market share and grew assets faster than the UK D2C platform 
market. However, we also saw a significant uplift in client share 
trading and associated revenues which carried on throughout the 
year. This resulted in our execution-only stockbroking market share 
increasing from 26.9% to 30.1%

, reflecting our competitive charges 
and user-friendly proposition.
In the second half of the year, improved investor confidence allied 
with bringing selected fund launches such as CF Woodford Income 
Focus, the increased ISA allowance and targeted transfer 
campaigns saw NNB accelerate. Strong flows and supportive 
markets saw Assets Under Administration (AUA) increase 28% to 
£79.2 billion. This drove revenue growth of 18% and, despite 
selective investment to support both higher client activity levels 
and our growth ambitions, we increased profit before tax by 21% to 
£265.8 million. It was disappointing that we had to announce on 
4 August that we could not pay a special dividend for the 2017 
financial year from these profits, but we have had a very strong year 
and are well positioned to deliver future value for our shareholders.

Developing our client offering
We continually look to enhance the offering that we provide to 
clients, and 2017 was no exception. Having identified that clients 
wanted to trade shares more, we also established that, for some 
people, their levels of confidence in doing so were low. 
Consequently we developed two equity funds: the HL Select UK 
Growth Shares fund and HL Select UK Income Shares fund. The 
innovation was to increase the communication and engagement 
with participating clients, allowing them to gain insight into the 
management of a share portfolio. As at the end of the year, 
£525 million was invested in these funds. We were also one of the 
first to launch the Lifetime ISA (LISA). Having been uncertain as to 
demand for this, we surveyed our clients, determined there was real 
interest and went live just after midnight on 6 April 2017 . We now 
have 14,550 LISA clients with £36 million of invested assets, with 
half of these clients being new to the business. I am always 
impressed at how Hargreaves Lansdown listens to its clients and 
pulls together to provide solutions that help.
Our desire to bring market leading propositions to our clients is 
critical to our ongoing success. We remain excited by the potential 
of Active Savings, our upcoming cash management service and we 
are targeting a live proposition which is ready to launch around the 
end of the year. This has taken longer to launch than originally 
anticipated due to the significant technology development required. 
This is essential as we are determined that Active Savings must 
deliver the same levels of client service as our existing offering. 
This year we took the tough decision to drop our plans to set up 
a peer-to-peer lending platform. Peer-to-peer is an interesting area 
and we can see the attraction to selected investors, however, the 
market size remains relatively small compared to the other exciting 
opportunities we have in front of us.
We have seen a significant increase in client activity this year. The 
number of calls, applications, transfers, trades and other client 
instructions have all increased and we have continued to invest in 
the resources to maintain client satisfaction with their experience. 
Our IT is scalable and has coped well with the events of the last 
year, including the general election. Our client and asset retention 
levels remain high at 94.7% and 93.2% respectively and it is 
pleasing that our Net Promoter Score
SM 2
 is at an all-time high. 
We continue to strive to provide an incredible level of client service 
in all that we do.
Net new business 
£6.9 billion
Expanding our digital footprint is a key strategic drive: we received 
138.4 million digital visits for the year to June 2017 (up 31% on last 
year). An important enhancement this year was the launch of our 
new mobile app in February. Mobile functionality is no longer an 
optional extra, it is essential for people who want to manage their 
investments. The app has been well received and we are getting 
great feedback from users. We have now had over 486,000 
downloads, and the additional functionality that enables clients to 
place cash with us has resulted in £72 million being added to the 
Vantage platform. The introduction of Touch ID as a means to login 
has also seen a change in client behaviour with more frequent 
engagement with their investments. As a result, we now see more 
digital contact from mobile devices and app visits than through our 
traditional desktop site.
With all of this in mind, I want to recognise the hard work and 
commitment of my colleagues throughout the business and thank 
them. They have strived this year to deliver incredible service to 
clients in the face of significant increases in activity and have 
also managed to develop the range and extent of the services 
we provide.
Delivering our strategy
As the new Chief Executive, my challenge is to drive the next phase 
of Hargreaves Lansdown’s growth. Our vision is to be a household 
name and the best place for savers and investors in the UK. This 
means investment in our people, marketing and technology as 
Hargreaves Lansdown continues to grow and add clients. During 
the year, we deepened our people focus with work on leadership 
and development, our reward structure, culture and succession 
planning. We have worked hard to build on feedback from our 
colleague survey and improve engagement. We have also 
commenced a broader initiative to bring our values, the enthusiasm 
for client service and pride in working for Hargreaves Lansdown to 
the heart of how people work here.
We have a leading brand and reputation in marketing. In 2017 , we 
have particularly been looking at how we use digital marketing and 
client segmentation to improve the effectiveness of spend across 
our channels. We believe these are sources of competitive 
advantage and will continue to invest in them where we can see the 
benefit come through. We have also reviewed our marketing team 
and restructured it to focus more actively in these areas, concluding 
that we will expand it to embrace the opportunities that new 
technology brings.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Effective investment in technology is also key. In February, we took 
the decision to set up HL Tech in Warsaw, Poland to leverage the 
considerable IT development talent located there. Our aim is to have 
50 developers up and running during 2018, enabling us to push 
forward with improvements and developments to our services at 
a faster pace. Equally, businesses must ensure that they have 
resources allocated to, and continually adapting their response to 
cyber attack, and we continue to invest heavily here. Ensuring the 
security of our clients’ assets is the most important thing we do.
Looking forward
I am pleased that we have delivered strong 2017 results in an 
environment where the UK has many challenges. Global politics are 
unsettled, our position with Europe in a state of flux and markets 
continue to be uncertain. Unfortunately, this state of affairs is set to 
continue for a while yet. At the same time, society is going through 
long-term changes in demographics meaning that people are older 
for longer. Pension arrangements are moving from defined benefit 
to defined contributions, where individuals must take responsibility 
for managing their financial future, and over a longer period. People 
are not making sufficient provision for this so the country has a 
long-term savings gap of an estimated £314 billion

. 
Offering great value and an incredible service
At a time where people need to be taking greater involvement with 
their finances, pensions and savings are increasingly more 
complicated. The advent of pension freedoms, the challenges of 
drawdown, the complexity of lifetime and annual allowance pension 
caps, new dividend and savings tax structures and six different 
forms of ISA have all made it more difficult. People need help.
Our purpose is to empower people to save and invest with 
confidence. We achieve this by continuing to place our clients at the 
centre of what we do: offering them great value, incredible service, 
making it easy and efficient for them to manage their savings and 
investments in a secure environment, and establishing a lifelong 
relationship with them as a partner. 44% of UK investors now claim 
to deal with their investments themselves, up from 29% in late 
2013

. This is a significant opportunity for Hargreaves Lansdown. 
We might have a 38% share of the execution-only D2C platform 
market but in the wider accessible investment market of over 
£1.1 trillion, in which we already operate, we have a much smaller 
share and an even smaller share of the relevant £2.4 trillion savings 
and investment pool. Our scale combined with our expertise and 
capabilities places us in pole position to be able to provide 
this help.
