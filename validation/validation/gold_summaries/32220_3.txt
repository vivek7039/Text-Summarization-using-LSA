 Record plc Annual Report 2017
Strategic report
4
Overview
The twelve months ending 31 March 2017 
have proved to be turbulent, with major 
political surprises, along with significant 
economic and regulatory changes affecting 
the financial services industry in general 
and foreign exchange markets in particular. 
Exchange rates have reacted to political 
surprises, in some cases markedly.
The UK’s vote to leave the European Union 
in June caused a major adjustment in foreign 
exchange markets with an immediate and 
dramatic decrease in the value of sterling of 
11% against the US dollar, and weakness 
against all other major currencies in the year 
ending 31 March 2017. Sterling finished the 
year down 13% against the US dollar, 9% 
down against the Swiss franc and just over 
7% down versus the euro.
Elections in the US later in the year also 
caused surprise amongst investors, with 
President Trump’s economic ambitions 
being viewed optimistically by markets and 
proving to be supportive of the US dollar, 
which ended the year having strengthened 
against most major currencies.
Interest rates broadly remain at historically 
low levels (with most major economies’ 
negative in real terms), although global 
central bank policy proved more divergent 
in the second half of the year with the 
US Federal Reserve announcing rate 
increases in December 2016 and March 
2017. In contrast, a rate decrease was 
announced by the Bank of England in 
August 2016, and the Bank of Japan 
remained in negative interest rate territory 
since its decrease in January 2016. 
Official bond-buying continued under the 
umbrella of Quantitative Easing in the UK, 
the EU and Japan.
The year also saw the first of a series of 
regulatory changes, with the introduction 
of mandatory collateralisation on some 
foreign exchange contracts between major 
market counterparties. This will be extended 
to more market participants during the 
current financial year. Regulatory focus on 
investment management has also continued 
with the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Asset Management Market Study, and 
the industry’s preparations for MiFID II.
Capital and dividend policy
Since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, 
the Board’s focus has been on building a 
robust business by continuing to develop 
its diverse suite of currency-related 
products and strategies, by investing in 
our people and infrastructure, and by 
building a strong and liquid balance sheet 
and regulatory capital buffer.
Over this period, the yardstick for our 
balance sheet has been broadly to 
hold excess capital equivalent to two 
years’ worth of overheads excluding 
variable remuneration. With net assets of 
£41.6 million, own cash
1
 of £29.2 million; 
a surplus over regulatory capital (adjusted 
The Board is recommending a 21% increase in 
ordinary dividend to 2.00 pence per share and 
a special dividend of 0.91 pence per share.

for the final and special dividends referred 
to below) of £23.1 million and overheads 
of £11.7 million, the current capital 
structure, with a surplus of just under 
24 months, reflects this policy.
As discussed further in the Business 
Review, Record has reported its 
highest-ever AUME, increased revenues 
and earnings, and further growth in revenue 
diversification, with revenues from Passive 
Hedging now covering all overheads 
excluding variable remuneration. Given 
this, the Board has decided that conditions 
are now right for a change in the capital 
policy. The new policy will be to ensure 
retained capital broadly equivalent to one 
year’s worth of future estimated overheads 
(excluding variable remuneration), in 
addition to capital assessed as required 
for regulatory purposes, for working 
capital purposes and for investing in new 
opportunities for the business. This new 
policy will still ensure a significant capital 
buffer over regulatory requirements.
Consequently the Board is considering 
the return of approximately £10 million 
of excess capital to shareholders so that 
our capital structure conforms to our new 
policy. Record will provide an update on 
this to the market shortly.
Our dividend policy targets a level of 
dividend which is at least covered by 
earnings and which allows for sustainable 
dividend growth in line with the trend 
in profitability. In line with such policy 
and improved profitability, the Board is 
recommending a 21% increase in the 
ordinary full year dividend to 2.00 pence 
per share. The interim dividend of 
0.825 pence per share was paid on 
23 December 2016, and the final ordinary 
dividend of 1.175 pence per share, subject 
to shareholders’ approval, will be paid on 
2 August 2017 to shareholders on the 
register at 30 June 2017.
In my statement last year I confirmed 
the Board’s intention, subject to financial 
performance and market conditions at 
the time, to return excess earnings over 
ordinary dividends for the financial year 
to shareholders, potentially in the form of 
special dividends. The Board is pleased 
to announce a special dividend equal to 
the excess of basic earnings over ordinary 
dividends, equivalent to 0.91 pence per 
share to be paid simultaneously with the 
final dividend.
In the future, the Board intends to pursue 
a progressive ordinary dividend policy, with 
dividends expected to be paid equally in 
respect of an interim and a final dividend. 
In setting the interim and final dividends, 
the Board will be mindful of setting a level 
of ordinary dividend payments which it 
expects to be at least covered by earnings 
and which allows for future sustainable 
dividend growth by the business in line with 
the trend in profitability. The Board intends 
to continue its approach of considering 
returning to shareholders any excess of 
earnings over the sum of ordinary dividends 
for the financial year and increased capital 
requirements, normally in the form of 
special dividends.
The Board will continue to consider 
ordinary dividends and other distributions 
to shareholders on a “total distribution” 
basis. The total distribution for any year 
will be at least covered by earnings, and 
will always be subject to the financial 
performance of the business, the market 
conditions at the time and to any further 
excess capital assessed as required under 
the policy described above.
Group strategy
The Group believes its core strategies 
remain appropriate to achieve sustainable 
growth in the business. Our primary focus 
is still maintaining our existing revenue base 
and growing this further through excellent 
client service and relationships.
Constant innovation is key to meeting 
the needs of our clients in a challenging 
environment. One of the Group’s 
key strengths is its flexibility which is 
demonstrated in its capability to adapt 
products, processes or distribution 
methods, and to tailor its approach to 
suit individual client requirements.
This innovation can be seen in each of our 
established products, where our strategy 
has been continually to enhance the value 
proposition offered to clients in order to resist 
competitive pressures on revenue margins. 
This is particularly true in the case of Passive 
Hedging, which can be mis-characterised 
by others as a commodity service, but 
which instead offers growing opportunities 
to save costs and add value for clients. Both 
Dynamic Hedging and Multi-Strategy have 
also benefited from enhancements to their 
investment process, and combinations of 
these products are increasingly tailored to 
specific clients’ needs.
The Board
There were a number of important changes 
made to the Board during the year.
Cees Schrauwers and Andrew Sykes 
stepped down from the Board as 
non-executive directors during the year, 
having each served a full nine-year term 
on the Board and hence no longer having 
been deemed independent under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code from 
November 2016. I would like to thank them 
both most warmly for their commitment and 
valuable guidance over the past nine years 
and wish them both well for the future.
Following the conclusion to a succession 
plan starting in late 2014, and allowing 
for a period of smooth transition and 
handover, we welcomed Rosemary Hilary 
to the Board as non-executive director 
in June 2016, having previously also 
welcomed Jane Tufnell to the Board in 
September 2015. Following the resignations 
of Cees and Andrew in September 2016, 
Rosemary succeeded Cees as Audit and 
Risk Committee Chair, David Morrison was 
appointed Senior Independent Director and 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee, and 
Jane Tufnell was appointed Chair of the 
Nomination Committee.
Outlook
Global financial markets continue to 
experience a mix of predicted and 
unexpected developments. Whilst the 
outcome of the French presidential election 
was as anticipated by markets, both the 
United Kingdom and United States by 
contrast continue to experience political 
instability. Elections in Germany and 
elsewhere in Europe, as well as the ongoing 
Brexit negotiations, still contain the capacity 
to surprise. Geopolitical instability, whether 
from the Middle East or South East Asia, also 
continues to have an impact on markets.
This environment continues to provide 
opportunities to engage with clients, to 
understand their objectives, and to develop 
tailored solutions. Record has the strategies, 
track records, operational systems and most 
importantly the people to do so.
Record’s success is a consequence 
of the hard work, commitment and 
professionalism of our people. On behalf of 
the Board, I would like to thank everyone 
at Record for their valuable contribution 
towards this success.
