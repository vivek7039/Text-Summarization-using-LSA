 2017 was my first full year as CEO, and 
it has been a year of repositioning for 
Lamprell. It has also been dominated 
by the problems on the East Anglia One 
project which we have worked hard to 
overcome, as detailed below. Despite 
early signs of recovery in the wider oil 
industry, the global jackup rig market 
remained dormant. Therefore, building 
upon our core competencies, Lamprell 
has adopted a strategy of geographical 
and sector diversification by addressing 
opportunities in the renewables sector 
as well as broadening our expertise and 
partnership options to access EPC(I) 
projects. We have also strengthened our 
position in our core geographic region 
and the new build jackup rig market by 
partnering with major energy industry 
players to establish a large-scale 
maritime yard in Saudi Arabia 11. This 
will broaden our global reach, product 
expertise, and secure a foothold in one 
of the few oil & gas markets committed 
to growth in the current environment. 
Investing in people will be vital to 
implement our strategy 08.   
Health and safety
I am pleased to report that we achieved 
a TRIR of 0.30 for 2017, in line with 
industry best practice. This achievement 
is particularly noteworthy given the large 
numbers of new employees hired during 
2017. In May 2017 we appointed a new 
Vice President of HSESQ 29 who has 
brought new energy to drive improvement 
in our safety standards. Although the 
results of this effort are impressive, we 
are looking for new ways to improve safety 
performance as our TRIR statistics should 
not be allowed to stagnate. An area of 
specific focus will be safety practices at 
remote site locations where the risks of 
an incident can be higher due to reduced 
oversight. We are striving to provide 
a best practice safety and wellbeing 
environment for our employees 30. 
Operational update 
2017 saw the completion of three new 
build jackup rigs, two for NDC (now known 
as ADNOC Drilling) and one to Shelf 
Drilling. We also completed the large-scale 
UZ-750 module fabrication project for 
Petrofac 27.
With the delivery of the above projects, 
our operational focus moved onto the 
execution of the two major projects 
awarded at the end of 2016: the  
USD 90 million rig upgrade project for 
Master Marine and the contract for the 
fabrication of 60 foundations for the 
UK’s East Anglia One offshore wind farm 
project. While we made good progress on 
Master Marine, 27, I am disappointed 
with the outcome of the East Anglia One 
project which has resulted in a significant 
loss for the Company, especially as we 
successfully delivered five major projects 
in 1H 2017 including the above three rigs. 
Renewables is a new sector for us and 
one which we believe offers significant 
long-term potential. It turned out that our 
first project involved a steep learning 
curve. Having said this, we have learned 
the hard way how to be competitive in 
future in this sector . 
Based on our root cause analysis for this 
project, we did not spend enough time 
and effort during the bidding stage to 
develop a robust project execution plan 
that adequately addressed project risks.  
We compounded this problem by initially 
assigning a project leadership team that 
was experienced in our traditional core 
competencies but not this new market. 
We have learned by experience that the 
risks and challenges associated with 
constructing and shipping 60 jackets 
in an assembly line process are very 
different from constructing multiple rigs 
concurrently . 
We identified a number of performance 
improvement opportunities, and we have 
already taken actions to deliver these 
including the replacement of the project 
leadership team, 26. As a result, 
we have seen substantial performance 
improvement as the project has 
progressed and we are now delivering 
overall productivity close to our historical 
norms, and we can see opportunities  
to improve this further . With correct  
project pricing at the beginning of the 
project and execution at the levels of 
productivity that we are now seeing

As the downturn in the oil industry continues to affect our traditional 
sources of revenue, in 2017 we struggled to execute on our entry 
into the renewable foundations market. This is a major new market for 
Lamprell which presents both significant opportunities and challenges.

19 towards the end of the project, we would 
have made a profit in line with our return 
expectations. This gives me confidence 
that going forward we can compete 
successfully in this important and fast-
growing sector .
Our rig refurbishment segment continues 
to demonstrate solid performance, and  
we noted a recovery in new orders 
towards the end of the year , although  
the scope of work requested remains 
below historical norms. 
In other segments, we reported 
successful completion of a mid-size 
project for Schlumberger comprising of 
two land rigs of their new design. The 
client is deploying them for operation in 
the region. This project has reinforced 
our emerging reputation for constructing 
high-quality land rigs in a safe and timely 
manner , and we will be looking to build on 
this in the coming years.
Implementing the strategic objectives
During 2017, the Group successfully 
implemented a number of steps towards 
fulfilment of its strategy as it looked to 
diversify and de-risk its exposure to oil 
price volatility and to access revenue 
generating opportunities in new sectors 
and geographies.  
Our most ambitious step in the journey 
of transformation was the joint venture in 
May 2017 to establish a major maritime 
yard in Saudi Arabia see 11. This 
was the culmination of many months 
of negotiation and due diligence, and 
so it was pleasing not only to sign the 
agreement with the partners, but also 
to see such overwhelming support 
from our shareholders for the project. 
When fully operational, the yard will 
provide Lamprell with an unprecedented 
opportunity to access a major growth 
market. Construction works have 
already commenced, and we expect full 
commissioning of all zones by 2022. 
Not only has this strengthened our 
position in new build jackup rigs, it has 
also led to further regional opportunities 
which are aligned with our long-term 
strategy . We prequalified for a long-term 
agreement with Saudi Aramco which, 
if successful, would make us one of a 
limited number of companies bidding for 
approximately USD 3 billion of offshore 
EPC(I) contracts each year . To access 
this opportunity, we are partnering with a 
renowned offshore installation partner to 
complement our construction expertise. 
In addition to the LTA, we are also 
pursuing EPC(I) work in other regions 
representing an annual opportunity 
set of approximately USD 3 billion. We 
have reinforced our in-house resources 
to be able to address the bidding and 
execution to a high standard and have 
invested in building a team with expertise 
in the segment, as well as specifically in 
working within an LTA framework.    
Our first win in the renewables sector in 
2016 has affirmed our intention to solidify 
our position in this fast-growing industry 
and having learned from the substantial 
project challenges we encountered at the 
start we remain enthusiastic about future 
opportunities – around 45% of our current 
bids are focused on this sector .  
Outlook
With many of our strategic opportunities 
coming into focus, 2018 is set to become 
a critical year for Lamprell. Our revenue 
levels will come under further pressure in 
2018 in the absence of significant new 
awards in 2017. That said, we are working 
to convert some key opportunities during 
the year: the first two jackup rigs from the 
Saudi joint venture are expected to be 
awarded with portions of the work to be 
subcontracted to our facilities in the UAE, 
and we will also know the outcome of 
the highly competitive selection process 
for the LTA in 2H 2018. In addition, some 
of the bids in our current pipeline are 
expected to be awarded towards the 
end of 2018. We are, however , seeing an 
increase in activity in our bid pipeline, 
which stood at USD 3.6 billion at the 
end of 2017 and are confident that the 
diversification strategy along with market 
recovery in the medium term will allow us 
to deliver on our growth ambition. Over 
the years Lamprell has proved time and 
again its ability to address temporary 
challenges and to emerge a more resilient 
and reliable industry player . That was only 
possible with an exceptionally committed 
and experienced workforce 31, and 
I thank the team for their full dedication 
during these challenging times.
