QUALITY. 
CREATIVITY. 
PRIDE.
W
hile we have always had fantastic brewers at 
Fuller’s, we take great pride in the nuts and 
bolts of the Brewery too. To make great beer, you 
need the best ingredients, the best brewers, the 
right kit, a large dose of creativity and lots and 
lots of passion.
This year, our new cross-flow filter became fully 
operational. It might not sound sexy, but it has 
helped us improve flavour stability. This means 
that the beer in our kegs, bottles and cans tastes 
better for longer – surely a good thing in anyone’s 
brewing book. It works by first centrifuging the 
beer to remove the yeast and then forcing the 
beer at high pressure through membranes with 
very tiny holes, which are only 0.65 microns wide.
As a result, more of the important flavour 
molecules make it into the beer and that’s good 
news for our customers. With more flavour 
coming in and a new piece of kit to play with, our 
brewers are experimenting even more than ever 
and that’s already resulted in a Black IPA, which 
was part of the seasonal calendar for the spring. 
With such creativity flowing, we just can’t wait to 
see what the brewers come up with when they get 
given access to the planned, new pilot plant.
