Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The year to 31 March 2017 saw a rise in annual revenue of 1 2%  
to a record £29.2m and underlying operating profit before tax and 
exceptional items of £1. 14m, an improvement of 75.4% over last year, 
reflecting the continuing strength of our strategy for growth.
CEO’s Statement 
Overview
After a difficult first half, it is pleasing to report 
that the Group saw a rise in annual revenue of 
12% to a record £29.2m for the current full year. 
Profit before tax fell 14.8% to £0.8m from 
£0.94m. However, when adjusted for exceptional 
administrative expenses and the prior year gain 
of £0.94m on the sale of Euroclear shares, there 
was an underlying improvement of 49% to 
£1.16m from £0.78m.
Notwithstanding the improvement, the Board 
and executive management remain focused on 
improving the gross margin, managing the 
administrative cost-base and maintaining 
revenue growth.
The market’s strength since September has 
demonstrated its resilience to the potential 
repercussions of the Brexit vote and also the 
surprise at the Trump victory in the USA. This 
strength, alongside inflows of new assets (being 
mainly client lists acquired during the year) has 
enabled our Assets Under Management and 
Administration (AUMA) to grow by 26.8% to a 
record high £5.2bn, with a corresponding positive 
effect on our portfolio managed revenues in our 
final quarter.
The proportion of less volatile non-broking 
income as a percentage of total income has 
remained steady at 61.7% (2016: 61.8%) and 
cash reserves of £7.69m (2016: £7.20m) have  
also been maintained.
Statement of financial position
As at 31 March 2017, the Group’s financial 
position remains strong with a 6.6% increase 
in the level of net assets to £21.8m (2016: 
£20.5m), including an increase in net cash held  
at the year end date of £7.69m (2016: £7.2m) 
despite higher dividend payments of £716,000 
(2016: £657,000) and acquisition cash 
consideration payments of £1,098,000 
(2016: £823,000).
Operations
Although we have seen an increase in 
administrative expenses a material proportion  
of which relates to the exceptional items and 
development expenses associated with enhanced 
systems and controls for meeting higher client 
service levels and regulatory standards costs  
were strictly monitored and headcount has  
been largely restricted to incoming revenue 
earners, their support teams and administrative 
sections directly affected by our growth.
During the last 18 months our Executive Directors 
and Investment Managers have been heavily 
engaged in a major upgrading of our systems, 
monitoring and record-keeping in order to develop 
our own rising regulatory standards and those seen 
across our sector. This has led to a significant 
redefinition of the way in which we communicate 
with our substantial client base alongside a much 
greater use of technology. We are moving forward 
to complete the hard yards of this exercise 
imminently. The outcome is intended to reinforce 
our current offering to clients by continuing to build 
and maintain a closer and deeper understanding 
of each client’s circumstances and requirements, 
thereby ensuring the suitability of the individual 
service being provided. We are hugely appreciative 
of our clients’ continuing understanding 
throughout this time-consuming but important 
process, which should see a much improved 
premium service delivered to our clients. We firmly 
believe it will underpin our prosperity with a 
stronger foundation to ensure a Company-wide 
emphasis on good client outcomes in a manner 
aligned with our culture. The costs associated with 
these developments and improvements were 
recorded mainly in the prior year and in the first 
half of the current financial year.
Preparations are well underway to meet the 
challenges posed by the UK’s adoption of the 
European Parliament’s MiFID II Directive. 
We continue to fully support and reinforce 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  
on its drive to ensure that advice given to clients 
by our account executives is suitable, 
well-explained and properly recorded.

that the scope for additional expansion 
continues to be a realistic prospect. The 
new and meaningful increase in the annual 
ISA allowance from £15,240 to £20,000 
provides an incentive for clients to continue 
investing into our ISA wrapper, enabling 
income and capital gain to remain tax 
free. The number of new ISA subscriptions 
this year was higher by 9.7%, alongside a 
similarly impressive increase for Junior ISAs 
of 16.8%. AUM within our ISAs soared by 
26% to £764m from last year’s £600m.
The Structured Investments division has 
produced an excellent year of results for investors 
with many ‘kick-out’ style products maturing 
early with healthy gains against a backdrop of 
strong equity market performance. Despite a 
financial year dominated by political uncertainty, 
reinvestment rates amongst investors have 
remained strong. Our competitive range of 
structured investment products continues to 
garner strong support amongst the financial 
adviser community, enabling us to broaden our 
client base and AUM.
In addition, our Alternative Investments 
management team delivered substantial growth 
in revenues and funds under management 
through the Tier 1 (Investor) Visa Investment 
Programme and Short-term Lending (property 
financing) mandates. The equity arbitrage desk 
continues to perform well, delivering even greater 
profitability compared to last year.
Wealth Management
Our Wealth Management division, run from York, 
continues to be driven by a focused management 
team and a highly qualified team of Advisers, 
who provide a committed, quality service to  
a growing client base.
Complementing this division, our Ebor Pensions 
business administers Self Invested Personal 
Pensions (SIPP) and Small Self-Administered 
Schemes (SSAS), along with a small number of 
Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes 
(FURBS).
AUMA of the combined divisions within our 
Wealth Management arm increased to £514m 
(2016: £501m). Turnover from Wealth 
Management fell slightly, reflecting the shift 
towards taking lower recurring fees as opposed to 
higher initial revenue, and this has contributed to 
the lower reported result for this segment 
compared to the previous year. However, a 
degree of cost-cutting and growth  
in ongoing activity has led to an anticipated 
improvement in profitability at the start of the 
current calendar year. There has been a pleasing 
continuation of this in the opening weeks of the 
new financial year.
Outlook
In keeping with our plans for expansion, we are 
finalising the move of our London head office to 
new more modern, high quality premises within 
central London before the end of 2017.
Trading activity in the opening weeks of 
the new financial year has continued the 
positive momentum seen in the last quarter 
of the year ended 31 March 2017 and 
your Board correspondingly looks to the 
immediate future with greater optimism, 
albeit tempered by potential political 
challenges and geopolitical headwinds.
Despite the present threat to political stability 
caused by the recent outcome of the UK 
general election and the significant demands 
we face from our continuing regulatory 
initiatives over the next 18 months, it is our 
emphasis on integrity, service and good 
customer outcomes which will drive our 
public profile and competitive positioning 
to deliver underlying growth in the next 
phase of the Group’s development.

Encouragingly, following its acquisition in 
March 2015, Barker Poland Asset Management 
LLP (BPAM) has delivered its second full 
contribution to our results above our 
expectations which has helped our stated 
aim of materially increasing the proportion 
of our revenues earned as fees, rather than 
through transaction-driven commissions. This 
is a key performance indicator reflecting the 
changing shape of the business from traditional 
stockbroking to an increasingly integrated 
investment and wealth management model.
Investment Management
The Group’s Assets Under Management (AUM) 
have grown to record levels. We recognise 
the growing importance of scale, which gives 
clients and market participants a degree of 
reassurance of the security of their assets and 
the strength and stability of the organisation. 
With total Assets Under Management and 
Administration (AUMA) at the year end 
standing at a high of £5.2bn (31 March 
2016: £4.1bn), our target of £5bn AUMA by 
2018 has already been achieved with £10bn 
being a realistic milestone for the future.
Discretionary and Advisory Assets Under 
Management (AUM) at the year end were £3.2bn 
(31 March 2016: £2.3bn). This pleasing increase 
resulted partly from the inflow of AUM from the 
clients of new Advisers and Investment 
Managers, alongside transactional revenue and 
positive investment markets. Commission income 
from broking and investment activity showed a 
strong recovery in the second half of the year, 
after a poor first half that had been negatively 
affected by Brexit. Net investment management 
fees signalled growth on the back of new AUM 
and portfolio values increased by 5.1 % to £8.2m 
(2016: £7.8m).
Gross revenues from the Investment 
Management division increased by 14.4% 
during the period to £27.0m (2016: £23.6m), 
which contributed to this segment’s significantly 
improved reported result compared to 
the previous year. Management believe 
Statement of financial position
As at 31 March 2017, the Group’s financial position remains strong with a 6.6% increase in the level of net assets to £21.8m 
(2016: £20.5m), including an increase in net cash held at the year end date of £7.69m (2016: £7.2m) despite higher dividend 
payments of £716,000 (2016: £657,000) and acquisition cash consideration payments of £1,098,000 (2016: £823,000). 10

Market opportunity
2016/17 year in review 
David Cameron’s announcement of the date 
of the Brexit referendum doused the flames 
of investment opportunity, market activity 
and overseas investment in UK. It allowed the 
fear of volatility to override the enthusiasm 
for sensible investment. The first half of our 
2016/17 financial year reflected the malaise 
that had pervaded markets and the resultant 
level of market activity which was low. 
However, activity picked up towards the end 
of 2016 after Donald Trump emerged as 
the surprise winner of the US Presidential 
election. The markets reacted positively 
as they translated his fiscal stimuli, 
infrastructure investment programmes, 
pro-business stance and decisive approach 
into an enthusiasm for risk assets.
Sterling suffered an immediate and extreme 
fall in the aftermath of the Brexit result to 
$1.30, having mainly traded in the $1.55 to 
$1.45 area, with similar falls against many 
other global currencies. Whilst this provided a 
price stimulus for companies with high levels 
of overseas earnings, it had a negative effect 
on inflation and cost expectations as investors 
operated a cautious and inactive approach.
After an immediate sell-off and recovery 
in the hours after the referendum, the UK 
equity market began a positive march from 
June 2016 to March 2017. The FTSE 100 
climbed from below 6,000 to over 7,400, 
buoyed by the positive effect of weak 
Sterling on foreign earning companies.
Expected increases in interest rates were 
put on hold as soon as the Brexit result was 
given; and shortly after the referendum the 
Bank of England reduced interest rates to 
0.25% and introduced a new quantitative 
easing programme to shore up confidence. 
Although ten-year gilt yields rose off their 
post-Brexit vote lows of 0.51 % (August 
2016), having fallen from 1.60% (April 2016), 
they rose to 1.51 % in January 2017 before 
retreating to March 2017 lows of 1.07%.
In the quarter following the referendum, 
commercial property investment stalled with 
the IPD Index falling over 2% (although this was 
to pick up through the year end and into 2017).
Inflation stayed persistently low at 1.3% in 
September and October 2016, but a recovery 
in energy prices and rising food inflation led 
to a spike in inflation in 2017, resulting in CPIH 
reaching 2.3% in March 2017. Inflation over the 
medium term has been expected to be close 
to the Bank of England’s upper limit of 3% due 
to a buoyant economy, low unemployment, 
imported inflation on the back of weak Sterling, 
as well as the longer-term effects of Brexit.
Our position in the market 
We continue to realise our aim of building 
an integrated Investment Management and 
Wealth Management business for high net 
worth and mass affluent clients from bases in 
London, York, Birmingham and selected regions.
The growth in Assets Under Management 
and Administration (AUMA) in 2016/17 has 
come from new clients attracted through new 
Investment Managers who have joined recently, 
and through the positive performance and 
increasing values of the underlying investments 
themselves. We see continued AUMA growth 
coming from opportunities in changes of 
pensions legislation, from ongoing referrals and 
introductions from clients and intermediaries, 
and from new joiners who bring their clients.
 
We maintain our culture and the appeal of 
independence, flexibility and integrity, alongside 
our Associate model, with a predominant focus 
on achieving the right customer outcomes. We 
compete with our peers and larger institutions 
who aim to direct their clients into services 
that suit those firms’ own corporate needs. 
Larger competitors limit the service that 
they offer to clients in order to simplify their 
offering, at the expense of client choice.
We also seek to develop revenue streams  
that constitute an increasing percentage 
of fees, adding complementary businesses, 
without detracting from investment 
management and wealth management.
The opportunities afforded by the increased 
pension freedom represent a substantial shift 
in the way in which SIPPs and SSASs can be 
viewed and, in particular, the potential for using 
personal pensions in different ways and the 
shift from defined benefit schemes to defined 
contribution schemes (including SIPPs).
The year ahead 
Whilst a high level of uncertainty continues 
to pervade the economic, geopolitical and, 
specifically, UK political status quo, markets 
remain threatened with potential volatility.
Risk assets, which have been bought and 
held by those with cash or with the ability to 
raise finance at the extremely low prevailing 
interest rates, continue to reach recent and 
all-time highs. We continue to believe in the 
importance of dividend income in this low-
interest rate environment, however, some 
equity valuations are being stretched. 
Signals of the beginning of the end of 
European Central Bank stimulus and 
low/negative interest rates have been given. 
In particular, the European economy is 
producing evidence of a stronger recovery 
than in recent years. We expect this to 
continue in the coming year, but note that 
whilst the French political environment has 
become more settled, there are still important 
elections to come in Italy and Germany.
 
The recent election in UK has created 
a much weaker UK government and a 
febrile domestic political atmosphere 
and gives the UK Brexit negotiators a 
challenging future as the timetable for 
working out what Brexit means begins.

The challenges of MiFID II must be met 
by January 2018 and beyond, and Walker 
Crips is working hard to deliver the necessary 
developments in keeping with the timetable. 
The resources that are being, and will be, 
employed to comply with the many and 
varied requirements of the new regulatory 
environment are an essential part of the future 
and will weigh on margins across the industry.
 
The industry’s period of change and 
modernisation in recent years is likely to 
continue, having accelerated over the last  
five years. Challenges will continue from 
more extensive (and expensive) regulatory 
initiatives, changes in retail clients’ attitudes to 
types of service and ongoing pressure on fees, 
changes in demand as a result of demographic 
shifts (an aging population) and transfers of 
assets between generations, with a focus on 
commissions and costs given the benign interest 
rate and lower income investment environment.
With barriers to entry in the traditional broad 
wealth management industry (as opposed 
to robo-advice and challenger entrants with 
extremely clean, simple, focused business lines), 
we expect further consolidation as a result 
of the high level of regulatory requirements 
and technology development costs.
