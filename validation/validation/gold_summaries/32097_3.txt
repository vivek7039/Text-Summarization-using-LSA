CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Our core objective is to grow 
shareholder value and we  
will do this by developing a business 
capable of delivering long term, 
sustainable and growing cash flows, 
achieved through a disciplined 
approach to deployment of capital 
and a rigorous focus on execution.
2017 has proved a challenging year for 
Northgate with a number of factors 
impacting the Group’s performance. 
During the year it became increasingly 
clear that, notwithstanding the competitive 
environment within which Northgate 
operates, there are significant opportunities 
for our business which need to be developed 
in a consistent and focused manner.
Performance
The Group’s underlying profit before tax was 
£75m which represented a 10% decline on 
the previous year’s £83m. The performance 
of our UK business was disappointing with 
underlying operating profits declining by 
£11.5m which represented a fall of 21% on 
the prior year. We have taken a number of 
actions to address this and these are set out 
in detail in the CEO’s report. Our Spanish 
and Irish businesses performed well and 
continue to make excellent progress with 
good growth in vehicles on hire (“VOH”) 
and with the potential for further growth 
in VOH, revenues and profits. VOH grew 
by 2,200 in Spain and Ireland; in the UK 
there was a decline of 2,900 which was 
particularly disappointing as we had 
anticipated a steadily improving pick up 
during the second half of the year. 
Cash generation was strong with free cash 
flow of £43m. This provides good scope  
to further expand our business, including  
our move into term hire, and also to return  
cash to our shareholders in the form of 
increasing dividends.
Dividend
The Group remains in a strong financial 
position, with healthy cash generation and 
a robust balance sheet. This underpins our 
progressive dividend policy and the Board’s 
continued confidence in the outlook for 
the Group means we are proposing a full 
year dividend of 17.3p, an increase of 8% 
compared to the 2016 full year dividend of 
16.0p. This means a final proposed dividend 
of 11.6p (2016 – 10.9p). 
This gives a full year dividend cover of 2.7x 
on underlying earnings, in line with our 
intention to keep cover in the range of  
3.75x to 2.5x. 
Board changes
During the year we appointed Kevin 
Bradshaw as our Group CEO. Kevin 
has a background in both B2B and B2C 
organisations and he has a strong track 
record of developing businesses through 
clear strategic direction with a focus on 
consistent execution. He previously led Avis 
UK and, more recently, was CEO of Wyevale 
Garden Centres, with both businesses 
enjoying strong profitable growth under  
his leadership.

The way forward
Our core objective is to grow shareholder 
value and we will do this by developing a 
business capable of delivering long term, 
sustainable and growing cash flows, 
achieved through a disciplined approach to 
deployment of capital and a rigorous focus 
on execution. Our touchstones will be cash 
flow and returns on investment.
There is significant potential for Northgate 
with opportunities to develop the business 
and grow revenues and profits. In several 
areas of our business we need to do better, 
with consistent and effective day to day 
execution. There is good demand for our 
product and services and we intend to 
harness this effectively through marketing 
clear customer propositions and ensuring we 
meet or exceed our customers’ expectations. 
There are also previously untapped market 
segments which we have the infrastructure 
and skill set to service and I am pleased to 
report that we are already starting to gain 
good traction in the term hire segment. 
Under Kevin’s leadership, we anticipate a 
significant uptick in pace, sharper focus on 
consistent execution and improved strategic 
direction. There is much to do at Northgate 
and significant opportunity to grow our 
businesses in the UK, Spain and Ireland.
Our people
I would like to record the Board’s thanks to 
all of our 2,900 team members throughout 
Northgate. They are the people who, day in 
and day out, make sure that our customers 
receive a superb service and we are most 
grateful to them. 
Outlook
Northgate is, fundamentally, a very good 
business with a superb group of people 
and an infrastructure capable of supporting 
significant growth. With strong leadership, 
clear strategic direction and a clear sense of 
purpose I believe that much can be achieved. 
The current year has started encouragingly, 
with some exciting prospects in the pipeline, 
and our team will be working hard to deliver 
an improved performance.
