CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
The Group has continued to make strong progress throughout the year. The ongoing store reﬁt programme 
in 2016/17 means that 97 of our 127 stores were trading in the new format at the year end. This, combined 
with our ongoing focus on product and brand development, has meant that our customer offer continues to 
go from strength to strength. Building brand equity in this way, alongside signiﬁcant improvements in our 
multi-channel proposition, leaves us well placed to capitalise on the tailoring expertise which we possess 
in-store and online. Our ‘Tailor Me’ personalisation service further adds to our proposition, making us the 
ideal destination whether a customer wishes to buy, rent or tailor their perfect suit.
RETAIL
We continued to pursue operational improvements across the business, which when combined with our 
ongoing investment in store reﬁts during the year, beneﬁted like-for-like* sales, which were up by 6.0% 
on the previous year (2015/16: up by 7.6%). Retail gross margins improved on the previous year by 2.2% 
as a result of more focused promotional activity. Stock levels were kept closely under control throughout 
the year. 
We opened 7 brand new stores, and closed 4 in the UK during the year. A further store was relocated into a 
larger and better location. We are considering additional new store opening opportunities in the UK in the 
next 12 months and currently have 4 conﬁrmed openings for 2017. The Group now trades from 127 stores 
(30 January 2016: 124 stores).
The inherent ﬂexibility in our property estate gives us options in what we anticipate will be a fast changing 
retail landscape. The average lease length across the store portfolio is only 56 months and we are 
targeting improved lease terms on renewal, of a 10 year term, with a tenant only break clause at year 5. 
The underpinning of hire and the demand for e-commerce ‘click & collect’ and ‘click & return’ points, 
together with advantageous lease deals, means there is an opportunity to expand our store footprint on a 
selective and cost effective basis, with good returns.
HIRE
Overall like-for-like* hire sales increased by 1.5% in the year, following very strong growth in the previous 
ﬁnancial year (2015/16: 11.7%). The broadening of the range to include lounge suits has proved very 
successful and has received enthusiastic positive customer feedback. We continue to invest in our Hire 
business both in terms of additional Hire product lines and improvements in our underlying Hire systems. 
Although currently small, our online Hire offer is increasing in its contribution to the overall Hire business.
We are conﬁdent our position as the leading hire brand will be maintained through the product and 
technology initiatives currently underway.
E-COMMERCE
Sales grew very strongly, up 15.7% on the previous year. Online sales now represent 11% of total sales 
(2015/16: 10%). Visitor conversion shows strong growth across all electronic devices and is growing 
particularly rapidly from customers reaching us via mobile devices since the introduction of a fully device 
responsive website in the second half of 2016.
Mobile and tablet sales growth was particularly strong and now comprises 43% of total e-commerce sales. 
Investment of both capital and expertise into the e-commerce customer experience has seen a signiﬁcant 
reduction in the number of customer contacts received regarding their online shopping experience. This 
improvement has provided us with the conﬁdence to actively acquire additional new customers and also 
focus attention on building on our existing customer repurchase behaviour.

The Hire website continues to gain traction and we believe it will achieve further growth, with wedding hire 
customers more frequently beginning their journey online before engaging with our stores to complete 
their transaction. We will continue to invest in enhancements to the Hire website in order to further 
improve the customer experience and subsequent conversion rates.
SUPPLY CHAIN AND COSTS
The effective clearance of residual stock through stores and online has enabled new seasons’ stock to be 
introduced into stores earlier, improving the customer offer and enabling much greater scope for tactical 
promotions. 
The increase in direct sourcing of stock from the Far East has increased our exposure to foreign exchange 
risk, but this was fully mitigated by our hedging policy during 2016/17.
We increased capacity at our warehouse during 2016 both in terms of volumes of stock which we can hold 
and also the volume of e-commerce orders which we can process.
PEOPLE
Ongoing plans are in place to establish a stronger service culture within the business, to support our aim 
to become the ‘ﬁrst choice for men’s tailoring’. Investment in people through recruitment, induction, and 
performance management continues, with a broad range of programmes available to all of our colleagues. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Performance improvement across the business continued in 2016/17 with strong like-for-like* sales 
growth and continued control over costs. Proﬁt before taxation on continuing operations was £7.1m, 
compared with an underlying proﬁt of £5.9m in the previous year, an increase of 20.3%.
REVENUE
Overall revenue was up 5.7% (up 5.3% like-for-like*) on the previous year to £127.9m. Retail was up 6.7% 
(up 6.0% like-for-like*) on the previous year . Hire was 0.4% lower (up 1.5% like-for-like) on the previous year . 
GROSS MARGIN
Underlying overall gross margin increased by 1.5% in the year (61.3% vs 59.8%), due to removal of the 
Spring 2016 mid-season sale and more targeted promotional campaigns leading to lower levels of 
discounting.
COSTS
Administrative and shops’ selling and marketing costs before exceptional items increased by 7.3% on the 
prior year, as planned. Costs remain tightly controlled with expenditure focused on areas that will add 
value and support the development of the strategic goals of the Group. 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are signiﬁcant items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which are disclosed 
separately in the Income Statement to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying ﬁnancial 
performance in the period. See note 6 for further details.
There were no exceptional items during the year 2016/17. Last year, an exceptional credit and an 
exceptional debit were incurred during the year, and in accordance with our accounting policies have been 
separately reported as exceptional, due to their size and one-off nature.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share on total earnings were 5.51 pence compared with 4.65 pence (after exceptional 
items) per share last year. Diluted earnings per share, on total earnings, were 5.39 pence per share 
compared with 4.50 pence (after exceptional items) per share last year.
TAXATION
The Group’s effective tax rate for 2016/17 is 22.7% compared with 21.2% for 2015/16. The increase in 
2016/17 is mainly due to timing differences between depreciation charged and capital allowances. 
DIVIDEND
Given the strong progress made in 2016/17 and ongoing cash generation the Board feels it is appropriate to 
propose the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 3.98 pence per share (2015/16: 3.75 pence) bringing the total for 
the year to 5.89 pence per share, compared with 5.55 pence per share for the year ended 30 January 2016, 
an increase of 6.1%. The ﬁnal dividend is to be paid on 23 June 2017 to all shareholders on the register as 
at 2 June 2017 (ex dividend date 1 June 2017). 
INVESTMENT
Total capital expenditure in the year was £8.8m (2015/16: £9.6m) and depreciation and amortisation 
was £6.5m (2015/16: £6.6m). This included the opening of 7 new stores, 1 store relocation and the 
refurbishment of 11 stores. The total capital expenditure included further investment in new Moss Bros 
hire inventory of £1.9m (2015/16: £2.4m), whilst depreciation on hire inventory was £1.6m (2015/16: £1.5m).
CASH AND LIQUIDITY
The year end cash balance was £19.5m compared with £17.3m last year after investment in new stores, 
store reﬁts and hire stock, and payment of dividends in line with our progressive dividend policy. Reduction 
in working capital partly results from timing of year end.
INVENTORY
The mix and volume of inventory in the business was reviewed during the year to ensure sufﬁcient 
inventory was available to support sales across the business including earlier intake of new season’s lines 
to maximise full price sales and gross margin. Stock at the year end was £16.7m (2015/16: £14.4m). 
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
The terms and conditions with our suppliers are regularly reviewed and adjusted so as to maximise the 
average cash balance, whilst improving the product gross margin.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The Board continues to believe Moss Bros has an exciting future, with the growth of e-commerce 
underpinning the move to full omni-channel retailing. The adoption of Moss Bros as the master brand 
supported by complementary sub brands and introduction of carefully targeted marketing activity has 
proved very successful. In order to maximise this opportunity, and with the increasing role that digital 
has to play in marketing, we will add further resource and investment during 2017 to support our omni-
channel proposition. 
Continuity of brand presentation and pricing across all our channels is paramount in ensuring excellent 
customer service and therefore customer experience. The introduction of customer relationship 
management (“CRM”) and the leveraging of our customer database will enhance communication with the 
customer and perception of the brand. 
Our ongoing investment in our People Strategy continues to establish a service culture across the business 
– our people are critically important to the future of the business. Our “Tailor Me” personalisation service 
is available in all stores - a simpliﬁed set of bespoke options offering a custom made suit, ready for 
collection within 30 days of placing an order.  MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 11 
RETAIL
The store reﬁt programme is now entering its sixth year, with 97 new or reﬁtted stores trading in the 
new look store format. Given the strength of our combined retail and hire offer we are continuing to 
seek expansion opportunities both through new outlets and relocations where we move to larger, better 
positioned sites. 
HIRE
We will continue to leverage the opportunities to grow our market share through all distribution channels 
including online. Investment in new product areas in 2016, such as lounge suits, has proved very 
successful and more investment is planned for 2017. Investment in new hire stock totalled £1.9m in 2016 
and is planned at a further £1.8m in 2017. 
Early season booking numbers for collection in the current year (FY 2017/18) are -1% last year’s bookings 
at this point. It should be noted that Easter, which typically marks the start of the wedding season, falls 
three weeks later this year. The newly introduced product areas continue to show the most rapid growth. 
The business continues to be in excellent shape to gain market share.
Moss Hire provides us with a rich source of customer data, many of whom are currently unaware of, or do 
not consider the Moss Retail or Tailor Me offer. We continue to believe the opportunities for CRM, in the 
context of a multi-channel offer, are signiﬁcant.
E-COMMERCE
We plan to exploit further growth opportunities both in the UK and overseas by strengthening our 
e-commerce capability and building on our success, leveraging the advantages that full omni-channel 
capability will bring, including investment in CRM to better communicate with both existing customers and 
potential new customers. 
SUPPLY CHAIN & COSTS
Our supply chain continues to be of signiﬁcant importance in delivering service and efﬁciencies. 
In the year ahead, in common with many retailers, we expect to see higher input costs; in product from a 
weaker pound, business rates and employee costs. We are therefore preparing the company for a more 
competitive trading environment and we are seeking to ﬁnd ways in which to mitigate these rising costs 
whilst protecting the investment we are making in building and sustaining growth.
We anticipate central costs will increase broadly in line with turnover in 2017/18 as we maintain our 
investment in our omni-channel capability, our people and our technology infrastructure alongside 
increases in our occupational and employment related costs.
Capital expenditure for 2017/18 is estimated at £10.2m, including £4.5m for investment in 17 new or 
reﬁtted stores, £2.9m in Technology and £1.8m for hire stock. 
INFRASTRUCTURE
We successfully upgraded our retail website and commenced integration of our Hire system into our core 
business systems during 2017. We will continue to invest in IT as appropriate to ensure that we have a 
resilient and scalable platform on which to support the development of the business in all areas. 
As well as introducing the latest technology, the IT investments will focus on improving business efﬁciency 
and delivering a better customer experience.
PEOPLE
During 2016 we have continued to develop our key people initiatives and have made good progress in 
establishing a strong training and development portfolio; The Moss Bros. Academy. We have integrated 
The Moss Bros. Way, our values framework, across key people processes and in particular recruitment.  12 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
We have established an employee recognition scheme, a communication platform and an engagement 
survey which is now in its second year. We have made progress on internal promotions, including Store 
career paths and appointments from Stores to Head Ofﬁce. 
The focus for 2017 is building management capability, change management and embedding customer 
behaviours and to support this we are equipping 4 Centres of Excellence; model stores that will showcase 
a multi-functional store with the customer experience at its core. These regional training stores will 
signiﬁcantly increase our training reach and further boost the cultural change that is vital to delivering our 
growth. 
OUTLOOK
We continue to make good progress in the delivery of our strategic priorities. The modernisation of the 
store portfolio is achieving the anticipated returns and we are continuing to make good progress on the 
implementation of our omni-channel proposition, which is reﬂected in continued growth in our online 
sales. Our people strategy is an important part of the future development of the Moss Bros brand, through 
improvements in our customer experience, leading to improved customer satisfaction and retention.
The retail landscape in 2017 will undoubtedly be tough, with an uncertain consumer environment set 
against the wider political backdrop and alongside rising costs of operation and a weaker pound. We 
continue to anticipate and prepare for a more competitive trading environment, whilst ensuring that we 
protect our ongoing investment in the business in order to sustain growth. 
The early response to the 2017 Spring/Summer ranges is positive, with retail like-for-like* sales continuing 
to improve year on year. 
The Group’s trading performance continues in line with the Board’s expectations.
