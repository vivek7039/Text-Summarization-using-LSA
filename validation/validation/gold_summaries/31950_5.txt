 STRATEGIC REPORT
12 Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Chief Executive’s review
The financial year to 30 June 2017 has seen Diurnal continue to 
build on the momentum following its initial public offering (IPO) 
in December 2015 through the delivery of key milestones contributing 
towards its vision of becoming a world-leading specialty pharma 
company focused on endocrinology .
 
In line with the Group’s strategy 
set out at the time of the IPO, and supported by the financial 
strength provided by the IPO, Diurnal has successfully completed 
the registration study and subsequent regulatory submission of 
Infacort
®
 in Europe, with recommendation for approval anticipated 
towards the end of 2017 , and commenced the build out of the Group’s 
commercial capability in Europe, with first revenues expected in 
2018. The progress the Group has made over the last year has set 
the business up for a commercial step change to drive the next 
stage of development.
 
Diurnal believes that it has an opportunity 
to become one of the few UK biotechnology companies to 
successfully take a product from concept to commercialisation.
Diurnal believes that its strategy of developing novel products using 
well-characterised active ingredients to meet significant unmet 
medical needs offers a lower risk approach than the development 
of new chemical or biological entities, whilst enabling significant 
in-market protection through both patent filings and regulatory 
protection.
 
For example, the active ingredient of both Infacort
®
 
and Chronocort
®
, hydrocortisone, is extremely well-tolerated, 
with an extensive safety database through over 50 years of clinical 
use.
 
Diurnal’s product candidates are protected by a wholly-owned 
patent portfolio, benefiting from granted or pending patents in 
key jurisdictions, along with strong protection through Orphan 
Drug designations.
Significant progress towards 
commercialisation of Infacort
®
 in Europe
Infacort
®
 is Diurnal’s most clinically advanced product and is the 
first preparation of hydrocortisone (the synthetic version of cortisol) 
specifically designed for use in children suffering from adrenal 
insufficiency (AI), including the related disease congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia (CAH).
 
Currently there is no licensed hydrocortisone 
preparation in Europe or the US specifically designed to treat 
these young patients.
 
Infacort
®
 is expected to be the first 
pharmaceutically defined dose and consistent formulation of 
hydrocortisone designed specifically for children.
 
The patented, 
immediate-release oral product has been designed to meet the 
dosing needs of children and is manufactured using commercially 
proven technology in paediatric acceptable doses to give maximum 
flexibility to clinicians in tailoring treatment to children as they 
develop and grow.
 
Currently , pharmacists often compound (grind) 
hydrocortisone tablets to a fine powder and reconstitute it into 
individual capsules or sachets to achieve the lower doses required 
for children.
 
Compounding is not a licensed method of producing 
medicines; it can be highly variable and may result in inaccurate 
dosing to patients.
At the start of the financial year, Diurnal announced positive 
headline data from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial for Infacort
®
 
in Europe for paediatric AI.
 
The study met its primary endpoint, 
demonstrating a statistically significant (p<0.0001) increase in 
cortisol values following administration of Infacort
®
 compared 
to the pre-dose values.
 
No serious adverse events were reported.
 
AI (and CAH) are identified as rare diseases in Europe, where there 
are estimated to be around 4,000 sufferers younger than the age 
of six.
 
Left untreated, the disease is associated with significant 
morbidity .
 
Many patients from the Phase III clinical trial are continuing 
treatment in the Group’s European open-label safety extension 
trial of long-term safety and biochemical disease control, which 
will provide further valuable safety data to support the registration 
and commercialisation of Infacort
®
.
Following the positive Phase III results, Diurnal submitted a paediatric 
use marketing authorisation (PUMA) application for Infacort
®
 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2016.
 
Shortly after the end of the financial year, and in line with regulatory 
evaluation, Diurnal provided responses to the questions (“Day 120 
questions”) received from the EMA following its review of the PUMA 
package, and the Group continues to anticipate recommendation 
for marketing authorisation approval for Infacort
®
 in Europe 
towards the end of 2017.
Addressing unmet patient 
needs in large markets
“ The Group is well positioned for its 
anticipated transformation into 
a fully integrated, world-leading, 
endocrinology-focused speciality 
pharma company.” 1 3  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Reflecting a small, focused prescribing base, Diurnal intends 
to commercialise Infacort
®
 itself in the major European markets, 
following regulatory approval, in order to retain the full value of 
the product and has made significant progress during the year in 
establishing its European commercial operations. Diurnal’s small 
in-house commercial team has been supplemented through 
a service agreement with the respected global contract sales 
organisation Ashfield Healthcare (“Ashfield”) to support the 
Group in building its sales and medical infrastructure in major 
European territories. Ashfield, under the direction of the Group’s 
commercial leadership, has completed the planned first phase of 
establishing a Europe-wide team to prepare for the anticipated 
launch of Infacort
®
 in 2018, with ten individuals currently in place 
in key European territories and fully integrated with the Diurnal 
in-house team.
 
Outside of its core territories, Diurnal will seek 
local distribution arrangements where there is a significant 
market for the Group’s products and executed the first such 
agreement early in 2017.
 
During the year, Diurnal has also put in 
place the commercial supply chain for the manufacturing and 
packaging of Infacort
®
 with leading global expert service providers.
Continued progress in late-stage product pipeline
Diurnal’s second late-stage product candidate, Chronocort
®
, provides 
a drug release profile that the Group believes mimics the body’s 
natural cortisol circadian rhythm, which current therapy is unable 
to replicate. Chronocort
®
 is designed to improve disease control 
for adults with CAH: clinical data has shown that approximately 
two thirds of CAH patients are estimated to have poor disease 
control.
 
CAH sufferers, even if treated, remain at risk of death 
through an adrenal crisis and suffer from high morbidity and a 
poor quality of life.
 
The condition is estimated to affect approximately 
51,000 patients in Europe and 20,000 patients in the US, with 
approximately 405,000 patients in the rest of the world.
Chronocort
®
 is currently being assessed in a Phase III trial in Europe, 
which is designed to study up to 110 patients in an open-label 
six-month treatment protocol.
 
Enrolled patients currently treated 
with a single or combination of generic steroids (standard-of-care) 
will be randomised to Chronocort
®
 on a twice-daily “toothbrush” 
regimen or will continue on their standard-of-care regimen.
 
The primary endpoint of the trial is the control of androgens 
(sex hormones) on the same or lower total daily dose of steroid 
when treated with Chronocort
®
 compared to standard-of-care 
treatment.
 
This primary endpoint is identical to the previous 
successful Phase II clinical trial for Chronocort
®
.
 
Secondary 
endpoints will include an assessment of fatigue levels and the 
relative effect of Chronocort
®
 on body mass index and bone 
turnover, all of which are indicative of clinical benefits.
 
The trial 
continues to progress well with over 75% of patients recruited at 
the end of the financial year and is scheduled to complete in the 
first half of 2018, implying a potential recommendation for approval 
in Europe could be forthcoming around the end of 2019.
 
An open-label safety extension trial of long-term safety, efficacy 
and tolerability of Chronocort
®
 in patients with CAH, previously 
enrolled in the Phase III registration trial, commenced in August 2016 
and is intended to provide further valuable safety data to support 
the registration and commercialisation of Chronocort
®
.

Chief Executive’s review continued
Continued progress in late-stage 
product pipeline continued
The Group continues to progress discussions with the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the requirements for the 
registration programme for Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 in the US.
 
Clinical study design requirements for CAH differ between the 
US and Europe, meaning that a separate clinical programme will 
be required for registration of these two products in the US.
 
In 
June 2017, the Group dosed the first patient in a food matrix 
compatibility study for Infacort
®
 in healthy volunteers, which 
is intended to support the planned US registration package for 
Infacort
®
 for the treatment of paediatric AI. Diurnal is continuing 
discussion with the FDA to finalise additional requirements for 
the planned US registration package for Infacort
®
. After the end 
of the financial year Diurnal submitted a proposed Phase III pivotal 
US registration study design and supporting data package for 
Chronocort
® 
to the FDA and, subject to their agreement, expects 
to commence this study around the end of 2017.
Building a novel early-stage 
endocrinology pipeline
During the year , the Group has continued to build on its strong 
platform in underserved endocrinology diseases such as those 
associated with the gonads, pituitary and thyroid.
In late 2016, the Group announced dosing of the first patient with 
its native oral testosterone product, DITEST™, for the treatment 
of male hypogonadism in a Phase I clinical study designed to 
evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability in male patients 
with hypogonadism.
 
Following a review of data from the first 
cohort of this study, in which the pharmacokinetics of DITEST™ 
were compared to testosterone undecanoate in patients following 
a meal, DITEST™ will progress to the second cohort of the study, 
which will compare its pharmacokinetics in a fed state and fasted 
state. The results from this study are expected in the first half 
of 2018. 
During the year, the Group initiated studies to assess the potency 
of different formulations of its oligonucleotide (siRNA) therapy, 
targeted to the pituitary gland, for the potential treatment of 
Cushing’s Disease (cortisol excess). If successful, these studies 
would facilitate to preclinical efficacy and safety studies, 
ahead of potentially entering a product candidate into human 
clinical development. 
Following a review of the current market for treatments for 
hypothyroidism, the Group has concluded that the needs of patients 
for replacement of T4 (thyroxine) are being met adequately with 
recently introduced products to the market. Accordingly , the Group 
has ceased work on its Tri4Combi™ formulation and is currently 
finalising plans for the development of a modified-release T3 
(triiodothyronine) product, where there remains a significant 
unmet medical need.
Maximising the commercial 
value of the product pipeline
As highlighted above, the Group has made excellent progress during 
the year in assembling a European sales and marketing force that 
is able to commercialise Infacort
®
 and subsequently Chronocort
®
 
and other pipeline products. The environment for the successful 
introduction of novel healthcare products in the US remains 
challenging, in particular with regards to ensuring that market 
access is optimised for a product launch.
 
Accordingly, Diurnal 
is likely to capitalise on the strong interest in its programmes 
and seek a US partner for commercialisation of its late-stage 
pipeline products at an appropriate time.
 
Diurnal will also seek 
local distribution arrangements for territories outside the US and 
Europe where there is a significant market for the Group’s products.
 
In March 2017, Diurnal announced a distribution agreement with 
Medison Pharma Limited (“Medison”) for Israel.
 
Medison is a leader 
in the marketing of specialist-focused products in Israel and will help 
Diurnal optimise the value of Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 in this 
territory, subject to approval in Europe and subsequently in 
Israel. Diurnal continues to assess opportunities for similar 
agreements, addressing selected high-value markets.
 
In March 2017, the Group announced a partnership with Clinigen 
Group plc’s IDIS Managed Access division to launch a Patient 
Access programme in Europe for Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 to 
ensure that patients with cortisol deficiency but no other treatment 
options can access these medicines as efficiently as possible ahead 
of anticipated European approval and commercial launch.  1 5  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Extensive in-market protection 
Diurnal continues to protect its product candidates through an 
extensive patent portfolio, benefiting from a number of granted 
or pending patents in key jurisdictions.
 
During the year, the Group 
received notification of the grant of three US Infacort
®
 patents, 
of which two key patents have been granted: a composition of 
matter patients for the product formulation and a method of treatment 
patent for all forms of adrenal insufficiency . These granted patents 
provide in-market protection for Infacort
®
 to 2034.
 
The Group 
expects to continue to expand patent coverage for its pipeline 
products in the future.
In addition to the strong and growing patent protection for its 
pipeline products, the FDA has granted Chronocort
®
 Orphan 
Drug designation in the treatment of both CAH and AI and has 
granted Infacort
®
 Orphan Drug designation in the treatment 
of paediatric AI.
 
Diurnal has applied for a PUMA for Infacort
®
 
in Europe, whilst Chronocort
®
 already benefits from the Orphan 
Drug designations for CAH and AI in Europe.
 
These Orphan Drug 
designations mean Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 have the potential 
to be granted market and data exclusivity for ten years in Europe 
and seven years in the US post market authorisation.
Outlook
The Group is well positioned for its anticipated transformation into 
a fully integrated, world-leading, endocrinology-focused specialty 
pharma company with the recommendation for approval of its 
first product, Infacort
®
, which Diurnal continues to expect in 
H2 2017. Together with its other late-stage product, Chronocort
®
, 
Diurnal has the opportunity to build a life-long adrenal franchise, 
providing critical medicine in underserved diseases of cortisol 
deficiency.
 
With the European Chronocort
®
 pivotal trial on track 
to read out in the first half of 2018, and with over 75% of patients 
already recruited by the end of the financial year, the Group 
believes that a recommendation for approval in Europe could be 
forthcoming around the end of 2019. Reflecting a combined market 
size estimated at over 400,000 patients in Europe and the US 
alone for Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
, the Board believes that 
the potential for Diurnal looks very positive.
