Strategic Report 
CEO’s Report
Denis Alexandrov
It is gratifying to report that the 
extensive exploration and development 
activity undertaken by Highland Gold 
during 2016 and 2017 has been rewarded 
with a material 56% increase in your 
Company’s ore reserves (proven and 
probable) to 5.1 Moz of gold and gold 
equivalent as at 31 December 2017 
compared with 3.3 Moz at year-end 2016. 
This JORC-compliant reserve estimation 
as at 31 December 2017 was accompanied 
by notification of a similarly compliant 
6.6% increase in the Company’s mineral 
resources (measured, indicated and 
inferred) from 16.1 Moz of gold and gold 
equivalent to 17.2 Moz on a year-on-year 
basis. At the same time, the average 
grade of ore reserves was lowered from 
8.0 g/t at year-end 2016 to 3.3 g/t at 
year-end 2017 due to lower cut-off grades 
and increased ore tonnage at our Novo 
and Belaya Gora operations, and the 
inclusion of the Blagodatnoye deposit. 
Last year, I emphasised the importance 
we attached to our Khabarovsk, Baikal 
and Chukotka ‘cluster’ initiative in order 
to drive overall development by focusing 
our activities in key geographic regions 
and maximising synergies. 
The potential benefits of this approach 
are well illustrated by recent developments 
at Belaya Gora (Khabarovsk cluster) 
where our Preliminary Feasibility Study 
(PFS) –largely compiled in 2017 and 
published post the financial year-end – 
envisages an integrated Belaya Gora/
Blagodatnoye operation with combined 
gold reserves of 932,000 oz: more than 
triple Belaya Gora’s 291,000 oz recorded 
at the outset of 2017. Grade was reduced 
to 1.44 g/t versus 3.3 g/t for Belaya Gora 
alone. Average annual gold production  
is estimated at 55,000 oz, with the life  
of the combined mine forecast to extend  
Stable 
production
to 2032 and estimated average TCC  
of US$802.
Operations at Belaya Gora, in advance  
of the PFS, focused on the processing 
of low grade stockpiles following a 
regulatory decision to reduce the mine’s 
cut-off grade from 0.7 g/t to 0.3 g/t. 
Overall output recorded a relatively 
modest year-on-year decline from 
45,000 oz to 43,000 oz.
An updated JORC reserve statement in 
respect of MNV, our longstanding mine 
which is also located in the Khabarovsk 
region, was completed and published  
in May 2017. This confirmed a doubling  
of ore reserves to 500,000 oz Au  
(as of 31 December 2016) which,  
in turn, underwrote a life-of-mine 
extension to at least 2022. 
We are intent on extending MNV’s 
productive life beyond this date and, to 
this end, we have budgeted for an annual 
US$3 million – US$5 million exploration 
spend. Near-mine exploration activity is 
ongoing and initial exploratory work has 
commenced in relation to our two new 
greenfield site licences – Zamanchivaya 
(4.2 sq km) and Kulibinskaya (38 sq km) 
– which are directly adjacent to MNV.  
A solid performance from MNV 
throughout 2017 resulted in a 6.6% 
increase in gold and gold equivalent 
production to 102,000 oz.
Novo fully maintained its status as our 
lowest cost, highest margin producer  
by way of a 7.7% increase in the production 
of gold and gold equivalent to 126,000 
oz in 2017 compared with 117,000 oz  
in 2016. 
A JORC reserve audit completed at 
Novo in November 2017 brought a 430% 
increase in ore tonnage. Ore reserves 
rose from the previously estimated 1.1 
Moz of gold equivalent to 1.9 Moz (as of 
31 December 2016) at an average grade 
of 3.3 g/t compared with the previously 
reported 9.8 g/t. 
The planned expansion of Novo’s  
mining and milling capacity to 1.3 Mtpa  
is designed to compensate for the  
lower grades and the first stage of  
the development, involving a series  
of upgrades to the mining system,  
is scheduled for completion by  
year-end 2018.  Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
The second stage, focused on the 
processing plant, is in the design phase. 
We continued to pursue our strategy  
of balancing a stable rate of production 
with the progression of our development 
and exploration projects, with the cash 
flow from the former integral to the 
funding of the latter. Output recorded  
a 4.3% increase to a record 272,274 oz  
of gold and gold equivalent and our 
guideline for the current financial year  
is a comparable outcome of between 
265,000 – 275,000 oz.
Our principal development project is 
Kekura, a world class deposit located  
in the remote Chukotka region in the  
Far East of Russia. Government approval 
for the development of a deposit  
of ‘federal significance’ (a standard 
regulatory requirement for an operation 
of this scale) was duly received in 2017. 
Exploration activity included 11,000 metres 
of reverse circulation drilling and 4,750 
metres of core drilling for the purpose  
of reserve confirmation, while work 
commenced on a state-funded power 
line to connect Kekura to the regional 
electrical grid. 
The Definitive Feasibility Study for 
Kekura was completed in early 2018  
and anticipates: 
• An estimated start date of 2021; 
• Sequential and combined open-pit 
and underground extraction with a 
total mine life of 16 years (twice the 
original expectation);
• Processing plant capacity of 800,000 
tpa with an 85% recovery rate;
• Capex of US$229 million (pre-
commissioning/excluding underground 
operations);
• Average annual gold production of 
172,000 oz for the first eight years  
and 46,000 oz thereafter; and
• Average Total Cash Costs of US$511 
per oz and All-In Sustaining Cash 
Costs of US$541 per oz. 
Kekura’s Au resources (measured, 
indicated and inferred) are currently 
estimated at 2.46 Moz commanding  
an average grade of 8.1 g/t, while Au 
reserves (proven and probable) total 
2.00 Moz with an average grade of 7.0 
g/t. Preliminary construction is underway 
with the bulk of such work scheduled to 
take place in 2019 – 2020. 
Additional R&D studies at Klen, involving 
external consultants, indicated the 
potential for higher than anticipated 
recoveries of more than 90% and lower 
than forecast operating costs. Such 
findings will be incorporated in the 
updated PFS which is expected to be 
completed in the near future. Meanwhile, 
additional exploration is to be undertaken 
in order to delineate any additional 
potential resources. 
In Kyrgyzstan, our fourth region,  
the Scoping Study for Unkurtash, 
published in Q1 2017, envisaged:
• Two open pits and an 18-year LoM;
• Processing plant throughput of 4 
Mtpa with an 80% plus recovery rate;
• Annual production of 133,000 oz of 
gold at an average operating cost  
of US$616 per oz; and 
• A Capex requirement of US$322 
million to commence production. 
Your Board continues to consider 
prospective partnerships to develop the 
Unkurtash resource and preliminary talks 
have been held with certain parties. 
In conclusion, I have every confidence 
that the quality of assets outlined above 
and the strategies that management is 
deploying to capitalise on such assets, 
augur well for the Company’s medium 
term growth prospects. 
You can find more details in the 
Operational Review which includes  
a detailed analysis of 2017’s activities 
including those associated with the 
health and safety of employees and  
the protection of the environment.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
KHABAROVSK REGION, RUSSIA
Mnogovershinnoye (MNV)
Production of gold and gold equivalent 
at MNV achieved a 6.6% increase from 
96,188 oz to 102,502 oz in 2017, thereby 
accounting for a fully maintained 38% 
share of total production. The average 
grade registered an 8% improvement 
from 2.36 g/t to 2.55 g/t year-on-year 
(reflecting a higher proportion of 
underground ore) while the recovery  
rate was effectively unchanged at  
91.4% (2016: 91.5%).
Completion and publication of an 
updated JORC reserve statement  
in May revealed a doubling of MNV’s  
ore reserves to 500,000 oz Au, a 
development that saw the life-of-mine 
(LoM) extended by four years to at  
least 2022. Management is intent on 
continuing operations beyond this date 
and a near-mine exploration programme 
– actively progressed in 2016 and 2017 
– is ongoing. The Company aims to 
continue budgeting US$3 – 5 million  
per year to support this effort.
May also witnessed the receipt of 
licences in respect of two greenfield sites 
adjacent to MNV, namely Zamanchivaya 
(4.2 sq km located to the north east of 
the mine) and Kulibinskaya (38 sq km 
located to the south west of the mine).
The re-evaluation of MNV’s historic  
waste dumps continued throughout  
2017, an exercise that has added a total 
of 1.07 million tonnes of ore (with grades 
of approximately 1.1 g/t Au) since the 
programme commenced in 2016.
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$617  
per oz (2016: US$607 per oz) while all-in 
sustaining costs were US$741 per oz 
(2016: US$765 per oz).
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$12.8 million was invested  
at MNV in 2017. This included capitalised 
expenditures and construction (US$5.5 
million), purchase of equipment (US$6.6 
million) and exploration (US$0.7 million).
OUTLOOK
The extensive near-mine exploration 
activity seen during 2017 will continue in 
2018 with a view to identifying sufficient 
resources to facilitate a further extension 
of LoM. Such activity will prioritise areas 
in the vicinity of previously mined  
ore bodies including the Intermediate 
and Deep ore bodies and the Burlivy 
zone, while also encompassing the new 
greenfield sites – Zamanchivaya and 
Kulibinskaya – where geochemical 
prospecting work was carried out  
in 2017 in preparation for 2018’s 
exploration programme.
Appraisal of the waste stockpiles – a 
potentially significant source of additional 
resource – will also continue in 2018.
Against this background, an updated 
JORC-compliant reserve estimate is 
scheduled for completion in Q3 2018.
Belaya Gora
Operations at Belaya Gora focused on 
processing low-grade ore stockpiles during 
2017 in advance of the Pre-Feasibility Study 
involving a joint mining schedule with the 
nearby Blagodatnoye deposit.
A lowering of the cut-off grade from 0.7 
g/t to 0.3 g/t was reflected in a year-on-
year reduction in mined ore grade from 
1.23 g/t to 0.77 g/t. The recovery rate 
improved to 72.5% (2016: 71.4%) and 
the decline in overall production was 
limited to 6% at 43,166 oz of gold and 
gold equivalent.
An exploratory drilling programme 
focused on the deep horizons of the 
north-western flank of the Belaya Gora 
licence area was completed in Q4 2017, 
an exercise which saw 111 diamond holes, 
totalling 12,686 metres, drilled over the 
course of the year. In addition, Stage 1 
exploration drilling was completed  
at the Kolchansky area within the 
broader Belaya Gora Flanks licence.  
The drilling programme, as at the 
year-end, encompassed 702 metres over 
14 holes and has continued into 2018.
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$861 
per oz (2016: US$678 per oz) while all-in 
sustaining costs were US$1,029 per oz 
(2016: US$1,134 per oz).
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$3.8 million was invested  
at Belaya Gora in 2017. This included 
capitalised expenditures and construction 
(US$3.4 million) and purchase of 
equipment (US$0.4 million).
OUTLOOK
The pointers to the future lie in the 
Pre-Feasibility Study, announced  
early in 2018. Features include:
• More than tripled gold reserves  
of 932,000 oz (encompassing 
Blagodatnoye and a 60% increase in 
Belaya Gora ore) versus Belaya Gora’s 
previously reported 291,000 oz;
• Upgrades to the processing plant 
(including the addition of a carbon- 
in-pulp (CIP) circuit) designed to 
improve recoveries from 72% to 
86-91% for Belaya Gora ore and  
90% for Blagodatnoye ore;
• New open-pit mining plans  
which envisage the processing of 
Blagodatnoye ore at the Belaya Gora 
mill and a combined LoM extending 
to 2032;
• Capex estimated at US$15 million in 
respect of the plant upgrade and US$21 
million to transfer mining activity from 
Belaya Gora to Blagodatnoye in 2023; 
and
• Estimated annual production of 55,000 
oz Au over LoM at an average Total 
Cash Cost of US$802 per oz and All-In 
Sustaining costs of US$848 per oz.
Blagodatnoye
The year under review witnessed the 
processing of extensive exploration work 
carried out in 2016 and the completion of 
an additional drilling programme totalling 
2,400 metres.
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$1.1 million was invested at 
Blagodatnoye in 2017 and represented  
a capitalised exploration and evaluation 
asset. 
1
OUTLOOK
The Blagodatnoye deposit is the subject 
of a prospective amalgamation with 
Belaya Gora’s mining and processing 
operations. The new mining plan was 
outlined in Belaya Gora’s Pre-Feasibility 
Study, announced early in 2018 and 
highlighted above.

ZABAIKALSKY REGION, RUSSIA
Novoshirokinskoye (Novo)
Production of gold and gold equivalent at 
Novo recorded a 7.7% increase from 2016’s 
117,577 oz to 126,606 oz in 2017 representing 
46.5% (2016: 45%) of total output.
Ore mined registered a 12.7% increase to 
858,106 tonnes on a year-on-year basis, 
while ore processed during 2017 advanced 
9% to 825,819 tonnes versus 2016.
Average grade was effectively unchanged 
at 5.61 g/t (2016: 5.62 g/t) as was the 
recovery rate at 85.0% (2016: 85.9%).
Completion of an updated JORC reserve 
audit in November 2017 saw ore reserves 
advance from the previously estimated  
1.1 Moz to 1.9 Moz Au Eq., as of 31 December 
2016, with an average grade of 3.3 g/t 
compared with the previously reported  
9.8 g/t and the aforementioned 5.61 g/t  
in respect of 2017. The lower grade reflects 
a reduction in the cut-off grade and a 
substantial increase in ore volume.
Work continued on the expansion  
of Novo’s ore mining and processing 
capacity from 700,000 tpa to 1.3 mtpa. 
In line with this a comprehensive survey 
of the hoist, headframe, crusher and 
main fan unit buildings was conducted.
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$291  
per oz (2016: US$254 per oz) while all-in 
sustaining costs were US$342 per oz 
(2016: US$274 per oz). 
1
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$13.5 million was invested  
at Novo in 2017. This included capitalised 
expenditures and construction (US$9.7 
million) and purchase of equipment 
(US$3.8 million).
OUTLOOK
The expansion of Novo’s capacity – 
designed to compensate for the expected 
lower ore grades – is scheduled for 
completion in 2020.
Design documentation for the project 
has been split into two stages:
Stage 1, which has already been filed  
with the Russian State Expert Board for 
approval, encompasses construction and 
installation work including the main fan unit 
building, the skip shaft and dosing complex, 
and run-off water treatment facilities.
Stage 2 encompasses facilities in relation 
to the processing plant and the tailings 
dam. The Company is also reviewing the 
potential for the utilisation of dense 
media separation (DMS) or X-ray 
separation to reduce capital costs 
associated with Stage 2 mill expansion.
Baley Ore Cluster (Taseevskoye, Sredny 
Golgotay and ZIF-1)
The primary objective at Taseevskoye, 
the largest of the Baley Hub projects,  
is a ‘de-risking’ of the site (by way of 
pumping water out of the Taseevskoye 
open-pit and monitoring any inflow of 
water from the neighbouring Baley pit) 
in preparation for exploration activity 
designed to verify reserves.
Some 4.3 million cubic metres of water 
were pumped from the Taseevskoye pit 
during H2 2016 and H1 2017, thereby 
resulting in a 10.05 metre decrease in  
the water level. No water inflow was 
observed from the Baley pit.
Pumping is currently on hold, due to the 
fact that the ZIF-2 tailings pond, which 
receives the water, is full.
In November, Giprotsvetmet, the mining 
and metallurgy research and design 
institute (Moscow), issued a trade-off 
study of various options available for 
additional storage and/or treatment  
of water pumped from the pit. Such 
options are currently under consideration. 
Funding was approved, in Q3 2017, for the 
commencement of design work on a heap 
leach operation at the ZIF-1 Tailings licence, 
containing approximately 300,000 oz Au. 
A technological flowsheet, drafted by 
engineering consultants Irgiredmet, 
anticipates annual throughput of up to 
840,000 tonnes of ore. The Company  
has selected Geotechproekt LLC 
(Ekaterinburg) as contractor responsible 
for all design work associated with the 
project. Engineering studies were initiated 
in October and technical solutions are 
under development.
CAPITAL COSTS
A total of US$2.8 million was invested  
at the Baley area licences in 2017.

Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS), including 
mine design, technical solutions, a financial 
model and estimates for capital and 
operating expenditures, was concluded 
during Q4 2017 prior to publication in 
early 2018. This, in turn, was accompanied 
by a JORC-compliant resource update 
which included data drawn from the 
2016-17 drilling programme.
Work was also completed on the design 
documentation for Kekura’s fuel storage 
facilities in preparation for construction 
in 2018. In the wake of an in-house review 
an application to the State Expert Board 
for approval is scheduled for submission 
in H1 2018.
The government project for construction 
of the Bilibino-Kekura-Peschanka-
Omsukchan power line, which will bring 
the regional electricity grid to Kekura, 
also made headway during Q4 2017. 
Meanwhile, State Expert Board approval 
was received for the planned 110/6 kV 
Kekura substation, with construction 
permits duly applied for.
Equipment for the substation was 
delivered to the Chukotka port of  
Pevek by Rostek JSC, under a supply 
and installation contract, and will be 
transported to the Kekura site in March 
2018 when weather conditions become 
suitable. Construction work is scheduled 
to begin in May 2018.
Klen
Further R&D studies, designed to 
confirm engineering parameters and 
mitigate project risks for incorporation 
into the PFS currently under development, 
continued to be carried out by consultants 
SGS Vostok during Q4 2017. Such research 
yielded positive results, indicating the 
potential to improve Au recovery to 
90.82% and reduce operating expenses 
and class V hazard for tailings.
A tender was held to select a contractor 
to carry out an additional exploration 
programme at Klen and work began 
in Q1 2018.

STRATEGIC REPORT
KYRGYZSTAN
Unkurtash
A scoping study was completed and 
published in March 2017 which envisages:
• Two open-pits and an 18-year LoM;
• Processing plant utilisation of gravity 
concentration and gravity tailings 
CIL with an annual throughput of 
4 million tonnes and recoveries of 
more than 80%;
• Annual production of 133,000 oz Au 
at an average operating cost of 
US$616 per oz; and
• Total Capex to commence production 
of US$322 million.
Management continues to consider 
partnership opportunities to develop 
this significant resource and preliminary 
discussions have been held with potential 
partners.
HEALTH, SAFETY  
AND ENVIRONMENT
The health and safety of our employees 
is paramount and Highland Gold’s 
endeavours to minimise risk and 
maximise protection are focused on:
• Safe working conditions;
• The management of operational risks;
• Across-the-board training; and
• Constant emphasis on the need for 
employees to develop a sense of 
accountability for their safety and  
the safety of others.
To these ends, senior staff from the 
Company’s Moscow management office 
(42 managers), Novo (212 managers) and 
MNV (394 managers) attended courses 
entitled ‘Conscious Safety Management’ 
during Q4 2017. Employees at Novo (100 
participants) and MNV (254 participants), 
also attended a training course on 
‘Internal Accident Investigation’, and 
eight staff from Moscow participated  
in a ‘Defensive Driving’ course.
In 2017, the Health & Safety team 
developed and introduced several 
updated corporate standards including: 
‘Labour Safety Management System’, 
‘Internal Accidents Investigation’, 
‘Behavioural Safety Audits’, ‘Labour 
Safety Committee’, ‘Cardinal Rules of 
Safe Behaviour’ and ‘Best Practices’. 
Tools compliant with these standards 
were introduced at each of the 
Company’s operating mines.
Audits of occupational safety 
management systems were conducted at 
each operating subsidiary in November 
2017, the results of which will be used as 
benchmarks in 2018.
November also saw the Company 
introduce a new Transportation Safety 
programme and implement transport 
audits to facilitate the drafting of 
improved transportation safety policies.
We are deeply saddened to record  
that, despite our endeavours, a fatality 
occurred at Novo’s underground mine  
on 13 April, 2017, as reported in the 
Company’s Q1 Report on 27 April, 2017.
The Lost Time Incidents Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) totalled 4.88 in respect of 2017 
compared with 2.30 in 2016. The number 
of incidents across the Group totalled 26 
over the course of the year involving the 
aforementioned fatality and 13 incidents 
at Novo, five such incidents at Belaya 
Gora and seven at MNV. This compares 
with one fatality and 13 incidents in 2016. 
The scale of increase is, in part, due to 
more stringent reporting requirements  
in relation to minor incidents.
During the year a total of 1,582 employees 
attended safety induction and fire & 
electrical safety induction (one-day) 
courses, while 235 managers and 
specialists underwent self-training and 
testing safety courses utilising OlimpOKS 
software and were certified on industrial 
safety (7 – 30 day programmes).
As in the past, auxiliary rescue teams  
at each of the Company’s mines have  
been kept ‘at the ready’ to respond to  
any emergency.
The Company diligently observes 
environmental and regulatory 
requirements and actively seeks to 
identify, analyse and mitigate any risks 
from operations that might impact  
the environment.
Approximately 1,800 employees 
underwent environmental training 
programmes during 2017, while 418 
employees participated in class I-IV 
hazard waste treatment training with 
subsequent testing under the OlimpOKS 
system. A further 75 managers and 
specialists attended a two-day course to 
familiarise themselves with the new ISO 
14001-2015 standard for environmental 
management systems.
An environmental management system 
certification audit at the Moscow  
office and at MNV, carried out by risk 
management specialists DNV, confirmed 
compliance with the requirements of  
the new ISO 14001-2015 standard. The 
absence of any significant discrepancies 
points to the efficacy of the environmental 
management systems in place.
