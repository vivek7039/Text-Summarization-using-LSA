and Rhum (“BKR”) fields, announced on 21 November

current Erskine single field exposure

and reserves

to Serica
●   Deal structured to control risk and minimise 
shareholder dilution

net to Serica during 2017 despite wax restrictions and 
December Forties Pipeline System shut-in
●   Serica’s operating and transportation costs 
maintained at approximately US$15 per barrel for the 
year despite production interruptions
●   Capabilities of the Erskine reservoir and wells 
continue to outperform the projections that Serica 
made when the asset was first acquired
●   Work continues to clear early 2018 blockage in 
Lomond to Everest condensate export line
●   Engineering and procurement commenced 
for export pipeline bypass to avoid future wax 
restrictions with expected completion in Q3 2018

targeted for mid-year

2 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Outlook for 2018
●   Completion of the Lomond to Everest export line 
bypass during Q3 is expected to deliver more 
consistent Erskine production performance and 
sales revenues
●   Serica’s 40% share in 2018 net cash flows from 
the BKR Assets, accruing under the acquisition 
agreement, adds to the Company’s cash resources 
upon completion expected in late Q3 2018
●   Transition work for the BKR Assets acquisition is 
well underway:
 –  Consultations with transferring staff close to 
completion and recruitment for additional positions 
in progress
 –  New premises for Aberdeen operations 
headquarters identified with occupation targeted 
for mid-summer
 –  Serica working with BP, OGA and partners to 
ensure safe and orderly transition
●   Serica’s management believes that the increased 
scale and diversification that the BKR deal brings, 
along with the associated operating capability, will 
provide a platform from which to further grow the 
business through:
 –  Identifying and implementing operational 
efficiencies
 –  Targeting investment to further enhance the value 
of its assets
 –  Seeking complementary acquisitions with a 
continuing focus on the UK North Sea.
