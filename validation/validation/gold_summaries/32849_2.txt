Annual targets for gold equivalent (GE) 
production are an indicator to the market 
of our confidence in our operating 
performance – and one that we 
regularly exceed. 
In 2017, Polymetal delivered a strong 
operational performance with a record gold 
equivalent production of 1,433 Koz, a 13% 
increase year-on-year, meeting our initial 
production guidance for the sixth 
consecutive year.
Top-line indicator, heavily depends on 
commodity prices but also driven by  
delivery of production volumes. 
In 2017, revenue increased by 15% over 
2016 to US$1,815 million, primarily driven  
by GE production growth of 13%. Gold and 
silver sales volumes both broadly followed 
the production dynamics.
High-grade, full capacity utilisation and 
continued operating improvement, as well 
as foreign exchange rates and oil price are 
the key drivers of total cash cost per ounce. 
TCC were US$658/GE oz, up 15% from 
2016 levels and within the Company’s 
updated guidance of US$650-675/GE oz. 
The increase in TCC was predominantly 
driven by the strengthening of the Russian 
Rouble. AISC amounted to US$893/GE oz, 
an increase of 15% year-on-year, driven 
mostly by the same factor.
Return on equity is one of the most 
important metrics for evaluating a 
company’s profitability and measures the 
efficiency with which a company generates 
income using the funds that shareholders 
have invested. 
In 2017, return on equity (based on 
underlying net earnings and average equity 
adjusted for translation reserve) was 16%, 
compared with 18% in the prior period,  
and remains one of the highest in the sector.
Our rigorous approach to all investment 
decisions ensures tight controls on capital 
expenditure, boosting return on invested 
capital for shareholders and sustainable 
development for the business. 
Capital expenditure came in at US$383 
million, up 41% compared with 2016 on  
the back of accelerated pre-stripping  
and construction at Kyzyl, as well as an 
increased brownfield exploration spend 
across the operating assets portfolio. 
Reducing GHG emissions is one of the  
core pillars of our long-term commitment  
to maintaining the highest environmental, 
social and governance standards. 
We are aware of climate change and 
recognize our responsibility to manage 
carbon footprint and minimize our GHG  
and other emissions. This year the part of  
our energy needs were met through clean 
energy sources and together with our energy 
efficiency programs it resulted in GHG 
intensity decrease of 8%.

Both extending mine life through near-mine 
exploration and new discoveries from 
greenfield exploration contribute to the 
Company’s long-term growth prospects. 
In 2017, the Company increased its  
ore reserves by 5% to 20.9 Moz of gold 
equivalent on the back of successful 
exploration at Albazino, Komar and Dukat, 
as well as initial reserve estimates at Kapan 
and Nezhda.
Adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of 
our ability to generate operating cash flows 
from the current business. 
Adjusted EBITDA was US$745 million,  
down 2% compared to 2016, as a result of 
increased costs incurred due to a stronger 
Russian Rouble, which largely offset 
production growth.
A key indicator in any business. Generating a 
healthy free cash flow enables us to provide 
significant cash returns for shareholders. 
Despite intensive construction activities at 
Kyzyl in the course of 2017, the Company 
continued to generate positive free cash 
flow
1
 that amounted to US$143 million.
Our aim is to deliver meaningful dividends  
to our shareholders at all stages of both the 
commodity cycle and our investment cycle. 
In 2017, dividends of US$138 million (0.32 
per share) were paid out and a final dividend 
of US$129 million (US$0.30 per share) is 
proposed, bringing total dividend declared 
for the period to US$189 million.
Underlying net income is a comprehensive 
benchmark of our core profitability excluding 
foreign exchange gains/losses and 
impairments. 
Underlying net earnings (adjusted for the 
after-tax amount of write-down of metal 
inventory to net realisable value, foreign 
exchange gains/losses and change in fair 
value of contingent consideration liability) 
were US$376 million, almost flat compared 
with 2016. 
An improvement in the health and safety of 
employees at our operations is a key priority 
with a goal of zero fatalities. 
Sadly, the Company did not manage to 
reach its zero fatalities target in 2017, with 
two lives lost at the Group’s operations 
during the year. Nevertheless, Polymetal 
notes a visible improvement in its overall 
health and safety performance, with a 21% 
reduction in LTIFR compared with 2016.

Gold equivalent production by mine in 2017
In 2017, Polymetal delivered a strong operational 
performance with a record GE production of  
1,433 Koz, meeting our production guidance for the 
sixth consecutive year. We expect further production 
growth in 2018, coming mainly from Kyzyl but also 
from Komar’s full ramp-up and our existing mines 
continuing to deliver stable performances.
A record-breaking year
In 2017 , Polymetal delivered a strong operational 
performance with a record gold equivalent production 
of 1,433 Koz, a 13% increase year-on-year, meeting our 
initial production guidance for the sixth consecutive year. 
The robust finish to the year was driven by contributions 
from the fully ramped-up Svetloye heap leach (Okhotsk hub), 
as well as a solid performance at Komar (Varvara hub), 
Omolon and Amursk-Albazino.
Gold production totalled 1,075 Koz, a 21% increase year-on-
year, allowing Polymetal to join the prestigious 1 Moz club, 
the second premium-listed gold company on the London 
Stock Exchange to achieve this important milestone. Silver 
production was down 8% to 26.8 Moz, due to the planned 
grade decline at the Dukat and Lunnoye underground mines. 
Gold sales were 1,099 Koz, up 25% year-on-year, while silver 
sales were down 14% year-on-year at 26.5 Moz, generally in 
line with production dynamics and volume. 
Analysis of production results
Mining 
Stripping volumes in 2017 grew by 39% to 114 Mt of rock 
moved, driven mostly by drill-and-blast pre-stripping at  
Kyzyl and the removal of historic waste stockpiles at Komar.
Underground development increased by a further 25% to  
115 km (2016: 92.2 km), with increased capacity to match 
processing volumes at Kapan underground mine, as well 
as underground development for new brownfield extensions 
at an active pace at Omolon hub (Birkachan and Olcha) 
and at Dukat hub (Perevalnoye and Terem). At Olcha,  
first ore stopes were extracted at the underground mine, 
where development is in full swing. Underground 
development at Perevalnoye and Terem is making good 
progress with both ore sources expected to make significant 
contributions to the feed at the Omsukchan concentrator 
in 2018.

Based on actual realised prices.
Ore mined decreased by 6% year-on-year to 12.6 Mt (2016: 
13.4 Mt), mainly as a result of the completion of open-pit 
mining at Oroch and a temporary suspension at Birkachan 
(where sufficient historic ore stockpiles are available).
Processing 
Ore processed increased by 14% to 13.0 Mt (2016: 11.4 Mt), 
mainly on the back of the resumption of the Birkachan heap 
leach project and the ramp-up of Svetloye.
As expected, the average gold equivalent grade in ore 
processed decreased slightly from 4.0 g/t to 3.9 g/t, while 
remaining close to average reserve grade. The decline came 
mostly from mature operations: the normalisation of the 
grade profile at the Dukat and Lunnoye mines; a scheduled 
slight decline in average grades at the Voro heap leach 
facility; and a lower gold average grade at Omolon’s Kubaka 
plant due to a change in the feedstock mix.
Production and sales 
In 2017 , Polymetal continued to deliver solid production 
results, producing 1.4 Moz of gold equivalent, up 13%  
year-on-year. Key drivers behind this performance were 
Svetloye (Okhotsk hub), Komar (Varvara hub), 
Omolon and Amursk-Albazino.  
At Okhotsk operations, Svetloye heap leach was ramped-up 
to full capacity, making a significant contribution to the 
Group’s strong performance and delivering superior results: 
GE production was 106 Koz compared with 23 Koz in 2016. 
Komar provided valuable support to the Varvara operations: 
almost 2 Mt of Komar ore was mined and railed to the 
Varvara hub, resulting in a record GE production of 123 Koz, 
up 53% year-on-year. At Kapan, GE production almost 
doubled: a good operational performance was driven by 
increased processing volumes and improved head grades  
on the back of ongoing measures to debottleneck the 
underground mine and improve recovery levels.
Albazino/Amursk achieved record gold production of 
269 Koz, up 10% year-on-year, driven by higher productivity 
and recovery levels, as well as a significant improvement 
in head grades. At Dukat, there was a 13% decline in GE 
production, where higher processing volumes and improved 
recoveries failed to offset declining grades. This is partially 
due to a reduction in cut-off grades, which take into 
account lower mining costs, lower treatment charges 
and higher recoveries.
Metal sales in 2017 were 1,468 Koz of gold equivalent, up 
13% compared with 2016, broadly following the production 
dynamics. While most of the sales are comprised of refined 
metals, we continue to sell concentrates from Dukat (gold/
silver), Varvara (gold/copper), Kapan (gold/copper and gold/
zinc) and Mayskoye (refractory gold) to different offtakers 
worldwide. Offtake allows us to maximise our margins and 
achieve an optimal combination of transportation costs and 
treatment charges/recoveries, this being one of our core 
competencies. In February 2018, Polymetal also secured 
its first offtake contract for Kyzyl concentrate.
Exploration 
Exploration – greenfield and brownfield – is a core element  
in our strategy for driving future growth and has proved to  
be one of the most efficient growth sources for Polymetal 
historically. Both extending mine life through near-mine 
exploration at existing operations and new discoveries from 
greenfield exploration contribute to the Company’s long-term 
development prospects. Our exploration activities are 
focused on six regions in Russia – Khabarovsk, Magadan, 
Karelia, Yakutia, Chukotka and Urals – as well as on 
Kazakhstan and Armenia. 
Four new licences were obtained over the course of 2017 , 
bringing the total number to 82, of which 60 are currently 
involved in active exploration activities.

Our key exploration objectives in 2017 
• Brownfield exploration and resource-to-reserve 
conversions and resource upgrades at our brownfield 
projects with particular focus mature assets: 
Omolon (Irbychan and Yolochka); Voro (Saum) and 
Okhotsk  (Levoberezhny, Gyrbykan, and Kundumi);
• a comprehensive exploration campaign at Dukat  
(the deeper levels of Lunnoye deposit, Primorskoye  
and Perevalnoye) with a goal to extend the scope 
of resource estimates;
• an initial JORC reserve-and-resource estimate at  
Nezhda’s zone 1 and further drilling on smaller,  
potentially mineralised zones;
• 37 km of diamond drilling at the Prognoz silver deposit 
to confirm the resources of Main and Swamp ore zones;
• a JORC-compliant reserve estimate and a combined 
life-of-mine plan for Kapan and Lichkvaz;
• 30 km of step-out drilling at Komar and an update of 
the reserve-and-resource estimates for the deposit; and
• continuing step-out and deep-level drilling at Kyzyl. 
Key 2017 achievements
In 2017 , Polymetal succeeded in extending the life-of-mine 
at producing assets and continued to invest in the next 
phase of our growth. The Company completed 421 km of 
exploration drilling in 2017 , up 48% year-on-year with the 
scope of exploration expanding to include our new assets, 
mostly Prognoz and Nezhda joint ventures, in addition 
to continued exploration efforts at existing operations. 
The total capital expenditure on exploration was 
US$58 million, up 43% compared with 2016.
As a result of our exploration efforts, significant resource-to-
reserve conversions were achieved during the year, along 
with the completion of new reserve-and-resource estimates 
for several projects, including: 
• at Albazino, the initial ore reserve estimate for Farida  
open-pit (169 Koz GE) and Anfisa underground (47 Koz GE); 
• significant ore reserves increase of 524 Koz of gold  
(+49%) at Komar;

.
2018 targets
In 2018, Polymetal will continue to invest in exploration with 
the goal of expanding the pace and scope of drilling, as well 
as a prospect evaluation. The key objectives are as follows:
• to achieve resource-to-reserve conversions at existing 
operations with relatively shorter life-of-mine; 
• Polymetal aims to complete initial ore reserves estimates 
for the following deposits in 2018: Irbychan and Yolochka 
at Omolon; Saum and Pesherny at Voro; Levoberezhny 
and Kundumi at Okhotsk; Primorskoye and Perevalnoye 
(revaluation) at Dukat; 
• to prepare an updated mineral resources estimate and 
achieve resource-to-reserve conversion at Nezhda to 
include the southern flank of ore zone 1 and smaller 
mineralised zones;
• to complete an audited JORC-compliant resource estimate 
for Prognoz largest ore zones, Main and Swamp;
• to prepare an updated mineral resources estimate for 
Viksha, based on new drilling data and metallurgical 
studies; and
• to continue step-out and in-fill drilling at Kyzyl to increase 
reserves for open-pit mining.

Outlook for 2018
During 2018, we have an important year ahead of us with the 
first production from Kyzyl, which is set to deliver free cash 
flow soon after ramp-up. This will pave the way for further 
investment decisions by the end of the year: the construction 
plans for Nezhda and the feasibility study for a second POX 
line at Amursk. In the meantime, we will continue to focus 
on sustaining robust operating performance at mature 
operations and advancing our long-term project pipeline, 
including Prognoz and Viksha. 
We expect further production growth in 2018, coming mainly 
from Kyzyl but also from Komar’s (Varvara hub) full ramp-up 
to 2.2 Mtpa and our existing mines continuing to deliver 
stable performances. At Mayskoye, a combined float-leach 
circuit with flotation will commence operation in May 2018, 
while open-pit mining will resume in Q1 2018.
The launch of the Kyzyl project is scheduled for Q3 2018 and 
is much anticipated both within the Company and by all our 
stakeholders. At the processing facility, construction activities 
will be focused on the installation of smaller technological 
equipment. In Q1 to Q3 2018, we will commission the 
accomodation camp, engineering networks and facilities, 
warehouse facilities, and heat and power complex, as well as 
the tailing dump and the main concentrator complex. Kyzyl 
remains on track to produce the first concentrate in Q3 2018. 
In January 2018, the first ore was mined from the open-pit 
ahead of schedule. Polymetal is on track to ramp up the 
debottlenecked POX plant in the second half of 2018,  
in time to take feed from the Kyzyl concentrator.
We will also focus on our new projects that will drive growth 
beyond the launch of Kyzyl. We plan to advance the feasibility 
studies for Nezhda and POX-2 projects and continue the 
drilling campaign at the Prognoz silver project, with an 
updated resource estimate scheduled for Q4 2018.
The Company reiterates its production guidance for 2018 
and 2019 of 1.55 Moz and 1.7 Moz of gold equivalent, 
respectively. The main growth drivers will be the ramp-up  
of Kyzyl, re-commissioning of the oxide circuit at Mayskoye 
and incremental improvements at Varvara and Kapan.  
This should offset anticipated grade declines at Khakanja 
and Voro. As previously, production in both years will be 
weighted towards the second half of the year due 
to seasonality.
Our focus remains on health and safety, where we are yet  
to achieve our principal goal of zero fatalities at all operations. 
In 2018, we will continue implementing a geomechanical 
management system that will help eliminate accidents 
related to mining processes.

OPERATING REVIEW
Reserves and resources 
In 2017 , the Company increased its ore reserves by 5%  
to 20.9 Moz of GE on the back of successful exploration  
at Albazino, Komar and Dukat, as well as initial reserve 
estimates at Kapan and Nezhda.  Gold reserves were up 5% 
at 18.4 Moz, while silver reserves decreased 3% to 158 Moz. 
At the same time, copper reserves grew 25% to 82 Kt.
Mineral resources (in addition to ore reserves) increased by  
10% to 18.2 Moz of GE, mainly driven by initial resource 
estimates for the Pesherniy and Nezhda deposits, as well as 
resource additions at the deeper levels of Mayskoye and Dukat. 
The average grade in ore reserves was stable year-on-year  
at 3.9 g/t of GE and remains one of the highest in the sector. 
At the same time, the average grade in mineral resources 
increased by 11 % to 4.7 g/t of GE due to high-grade 
resource additions at new projects.
We expect 2018 to result in further significant extensions 
of our reserves and resources.
