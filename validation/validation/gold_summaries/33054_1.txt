 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20-F 2002
8
2002 was a significant year for ICI and, although the
hoped-for global economic upturn did not materialise, we
emerged in substantially better shape than a year earlier.
The early months of the year were dominated by the successful
execution of the Rights Issue, which raised net proceeds
of just over £800m, making it one of the largest to date in
London. It received excellent and much appreciated support,
with shareholders taking up more than 91% of the rights.
Once again, I’d like to thank shareholders for confirming their
confidence that ICI’s strategy is the right one to deliver long-
term success.
The intended sale of Synetix, our catalyst business, was
announced in February. A sale agreement with Johnson
Matthey was concluded in September and the divestment
was subsequently completed with gross proceeds of £260m.
In June we also reached agreement with CSFB Global
Opportunities Partners for the sale of ICI’s interest in
Huntsman International Holdings. We received an initial 
cash payment of $160m (£109m) with the balance of $280m
(£174m) payable before the end of May 2003.
The combination of the Rights Issue, divestment proceeds
and our success in improving organic cash generation,
reduced the level of year-end debt from almost £3bn in 2001
to less than £1.7bn in 2002. Interest cover for the year rose
from 3.5 to 4.3 times.
With structurally lower levels of debt, ICI exited 2002 with
a balance sheet that provides a solid foundation from which
to grow the profit of our core specialty products and paints
businesses.
Performance 2002
In performance terms, our businesses once again demonstrated
resilience in economically difficult times. Profit before tax,
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of £400m was
only £1m lower than last year. Our International Businesses
delivered comparable sales growth of 1% and trading profit of
£543m that was only 1% lower, on a comparable basis. Given
the weakness in most major Western economies, this was a
creditable performance. Overall gross margin percentages in
the International Businesses were maintained at last year’s
level and fixed costs were well controlled. The Group’s net
operating cash flow improved substantially for the year,
particularly with the benefits of further working capital
efficiency improvements in the International Businesses.
The International Businesses achieved comparable sales
growth in three regions of the world, with the strongest
growth in Asia. The Group also performed well in North
America and Europe, seen against the backdrop of lower
economic growth. And, whilst sales in hard currency terms
were down in Latin America, the significant weakening of the
exchange rates in Argentina and Brazil were primary
contributors to this.
Paints once again led the way, despite the difficult economic
conditions in Latin America, with continued double-digit sales
and profit growth in Asia and good performances in both
Europe and North America.
National Starch improved sales and profit with excellent
progress in Asia and a return to growth in North America. Its
electronics businesses grew sales by 6% in difficult markets
and, in the second half, adhesives returned to top-line growth.
Food and Industrial Starches and Specialty Synthetic
Polymers also delivered good sales growth.
chief executive’s statement Uniqema made a weak start to the year, with industrial
demand down. The picture improved somewhat as the year
progressed, but year-on-year comparable profits fell 24%,
although the high growth potential areas of lubricants and
personal care were more encouraging, with sales growth of
9% and 4% respectively.
Quest achieved good sales growth in North America and Asia.
Fine fragrances performed particularly strongly. However,
problems in the second quarter with new supply chain
systems caused an order backlog at our major Food site in
the Netherlands. Although the problem was largely rectified
by October, production was disrupted for a period. Quest is
determined to restore its reputation for excellent customer
service.
For our Regional and Industrial businesses, higher profits in
Pakistan and Argentina were offset by the loss of profits from
divested businesses and a legal provision.
Despite the respectable overall performance, I regret that I
cannot report the improvement in ICI’s share price for which
we are all working. Against our selected peer group, our
ranking in terms of Total Shareholder Return remained 13
of 17. This performance is disappointing. The Board and I
continue to believe that ICI has all the necessary components
for an improved placing and are committed to achieving that
improvement.
I remain convinced that, given the improved strength of our
balance sheet, our stated goals – organic sales growth of 4 to
5% (1 to 2% above global GDP), plus another 1 to 2% growth
from synergistic bolt-on acquisitions – are achievable, once
economies improve. We believe that this, in combination with
improved operational effectiveness, will provide the basis for
consistent, longer-term profit growth.
Exciting progress
We’re already making progress on a number of fronts. We are
launching innovative new products across the Group, such as
Paints’ one-coat elastomeric ‘Polycell Basecoat’, which was
an instant success in the UK. Our science and technology
function continues to enhance its reputation. National Starch
researchers, for example, are working with the US Army
Research Laboratories developing sealants and encapsulants
to protect tomorrow’s flexible flat screens from moisture and
oxygen. Some of our largest global customers have
expressed interest in understanding how ICI businesses’
technology and know-how might be leveraged in collaborations
to generate long-term added value for their product
development programmes.
ICI is focused on growth and we have an increasing number
of people in the regions with significant potential. In China,
an important growth market, we now have 1,400 employees,
up from some 900 only four years ago, and we continue to
invest in manufacturing and marketing facilities in the country.
ICI is global, but our success is often built on local management
able to understand and respond to local consumer and
customer requirements.
In May we published “The ICI Report on the Secrets of the
Senses”, Dr Charles Spence of Oxford University’s ground
breaking research into the importance of sensory experience
for health and emotional wellbeing. This helped focus
attention on ICI’s expertise in the growth areas of the science
of sight, scent, taste and touch, the heart of our business
today.
Our people
In conclusion, I want to thank our employees all around the
world for the dedication and effort that delivered commendable
results under difficult conditions. When the tide turns, I know
we will be ready.
