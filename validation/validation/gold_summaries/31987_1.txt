CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
Overview
Our transition to a commercial stage diagnostics business is 
well underway. genedrive plc now has a clear strategic 
direction and the efforts of the Company are focused 
towards advancing our offerings as a disease detection 
business built around the Genedrive® platform. I am pleased 
with the progress made in the year but we are aware there 
are still challenges ahead of us for the Company to fully 
realise the considerable potential of Genedrive®.
David Budd
Chief Executive Officer
We continue to make strong 
progress with a disciplined 
approach to executing our 
strategy.
Our Performance 
Revenue for the period was £5.8m, up 13.7% from the £5.1m 
on the prior period. This year-over-year growth in revenue 
was driven by the Diagnostics division that saw revenue 
growth of 36.8% to £2.6m (2016: £1.9m). Our pathogen 
detection programme with the DoD was central to this 
growth with revenue of £2.2m, up £0.5m from 2016. Services 
revenue was £3.2m (2016: £3.1m), up 3.2%. We closed the 
year with £5.1m of cash (2016: £1.1m). Targeted investment of 
our cash resources remains vital as we assess and prioritise 
the various commercial and development opportunities 
before us.
The Genedrive® Platform – Strategic Progress
During the year we announced the successful studies on our 
HCV ID kit conducted at the Institut Pasteur, Paris and 
Queens University Nottingham. Following these successful 
studies that showed overall sensitivity of greater than 99% 
and specificity of 100%, the product was submitted for CE 
marking in April 2017. I am pleased that in September 2017 
the product obtained its CE registration. With the HCV ID kit 
now CE registered we are in a position to begin 
commercialisation efforts. We have signed a distribution 
agreement with Sysmex Europe, a world leader in clinical 
laboratory systemization and solutions, for the EMEA with an 
initial focus on Africa. Working together, the companies will 
now focus on securing the required regulatory approvals in 
individual territories of Africa and we anticipate commercial 
traction during the 2017/2018 financial year. This agreement 
is an important step to providing access to Genedrive® 
across target countries in Africa and we are delighted to be 
working with Sysmex Europe who have the experience and 
networks needed to market and commercialise the product.
Our Genedrive® HCV ID kit will initially be launched and sold 
into decentralised laboratories; being facilities outside of 
large hospitals. Our test is performed from plasma, which is 
currently isolated from whole blood using a centrifuge. As 
direct acting antiviral use increases in the future, we 
anticipate an increased demand for diagnostics in even 
smaller, point-of-need facilities. To support future positioning 
in this user segment, the Company has secured a £0.6m 
conditional offer of development funding from Innovate UK.  
When confirmed the grant will be used to further our 
Centrifuge Free Plasma Separation device concept, so that

smaller facilities without centrifuges can also use 
Genedrive® HCV ID.  We also intend to refine, improve  
and simplify other aspects of the HCV test to make it even 
more suitable for point of need testing to maximize its 
commercial potential.
Commercialisation of our MTB test in India has continued to 
be challenging in the past year, primarily owing to a 
component issue in the sample preparation process specific 
to that test, but also compounded by commercial issues. We 
believe we have resolved the problem but, until validated in 
the field, revenues are not expected in the short term. The 
market dynamics of MTB have not changed since genedrive 
plc identified the opportunity, the market is large and well 
defined and there is significant potential in smaller 
laboratories. However with the benefit of experience 
acquired in the field, we are considering how best to 
address the Indian market and the broader potential of 
Genedrive® MTB/RIF in this area. It is possible that to fully 
exploit the potential of MTB we may need to more fully 
refine our sample preparation processes before re-
engaging the market.
The programme with the DoD has seen continued success. 
This work involves collaboration with the DoD to develop 
biohazard tests for Genedrive® in the context of a small 
portable diagnostics device capable of deployment in the 
field. The work not only validates Genedrive® as a flexible 
and accurate diagnostics device, it has helped to fund 
important developments such as Bluetooth connectivity and 
uninterruptible power supply that will benefit customer 
adoption. The DoD has not indicated the intended future 
sustained use of Genedrive® and as such it is not possible 
for us to predict future commercial revenues. However, post 
year end an additional funding award was made to support 
the continuation of the project and an award was made to 
support ongoing validation work. This additional funding is 
expected to generate approximately $1.4m in development 
and commercial income of $0.5m for the financial year to 
30 June 2018.
Services Operations
As previously stated, we have been seeking strategic 
alternatives for our Services business including considering 
divestment. We have yet to secure a disposal although 
discussions are ongoing but should a divestment on 
acceptable terms not be possible, we remain flexible to the 
division being retained within the Company.  We do believe 
that focusing our efforts on Genedrive® should remain a 
core strategic priority.
Revenues from our larger US based programmes were 
slightly down in the year, 8.8%, but the decline is owing to 
the life-cycle of the projects as opposed to underlying 
trends in the market. Conversely European business 
enjoyed a good period of growth, 17.8% year over year. The 
growth was delivered from a growing number of 
programmes with smaller customers, and was aided by 
improvements to our marketing, contacts and relationship 
management.
Outlook
We are now entering a defining period for genedrive plc. 
The CE marked Genedrive® HCV ID kit positions the 
Company as first to market with an affordable and cost 
effective HCV test. In the current financial year, we will be 
working with our distribution partner(s) to begin 
commercialisation efforts and secure requisite regulatory 
approvals. While we have challenges with MTB our 
experience in the market and successes with the DoD and 
CEFAS projects underline the potential of the Genedrive® as 
a flexible, portable and cost effective platform for 
decentralised molecular diagnostics. To more fully realise 
that potential, particularly outside decentralised laboratories 
at point of care, we intend to focus some development work 
on refining, improving and simplifying product workflow. This 
will maximise the commercial potential in HCV and in other 
infectious diseases including MTB. The Board is encouraged 
by the growing momentum in the business and the outlook 
for genedrive plc.

‘Early diagnosis of hepatitis infection is 
critical for effective treatment and care.  
Yet globally, less than 5% of persons with 
chronic viral hepatitis are aware of their 
status. Awareness is lacking, reliable 
diagnostics that are appropriate for the 
setting of intended use and testing services 
are not sufficiently available and laboratory 
capacity is weak.’

Target Market
The TB market is large and well defined. The Genedrive® 
MTB/RIF assay aims to increase the adoption and availability 
of sophisticated molecular diagnostic analysis. Within India 
we are targeting small to medium size labs where throughput 
does not support more expensive lab equipment, but where 
Genedrive® can replace the need to refer to central labs.

Progress
Commercial traction in the first half of the year was impaired 
by a sample preparation component problem. During the 
second half of the year we identified the issue, isolated the 
component and sourced a replacement. Commercial and 
contractual issues during this time have slowed our ability to 
subsequently re-engage the market. Currently the Company 
has the option to continue with the product, or return to the 
market in the medium term with further refined sample 
preparation approach that could allow us to target market 
opportunities beyond India.
