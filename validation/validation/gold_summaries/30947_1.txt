 Chief Executive’s review
We are confident of  
our enormous potential
Hochschild delivered another record year of production whilst maintaining cost 
increases within expectations, excellent environmental performance, advancing 
our brownfield programme and continuing our drive to repay debt and optimise 
our balance sheet. We have also begun to widen our exploration focus to include 
selected greenfield projects across the Americas as well as assessing a wide variety 
of joint ventures and acquisitions that could supplement our long-term growth 
profile at a low cost.
No less important and in response to the 
fatalities that occurred during the year, I would 
like to highlight that the management team has 
designed and is implementing the ‘Hochschild 
Safety T ransformation’ plan which will reinforce 
the entire Company’s commitment to a safe 
working environment.
Operations
Our core operations produced over half a million 
attributable gold equivalent ounces (38.0 million 
silver equivalent ounces) for the first time since 
the IPO – achieving a fifth year of output 
increases and improving on our original 37.0 
million ounce silver equivalent target. This, yet 
again, demonstrates the value of our long-term 
organic growth strategy. Inmaculada was a key 
driver, delivering another record year of almost 
240,000 gold equivalent ounces at a competitive 
all-in sustaining cost of $721 per gold equivalent 
ounce ($9.7 per silver equivalent ounce). San 
Jose also achieved a record (7.1 million 
attributable silver equivalent ounces) and 
Pallancata moved strongly into a new phase with 
7.7 million silver equivalent ounces at a cost of 
$10.7 per silver equivalent ounce. At our Arcata 
mine, the effects of a lengthy permit delay to 
brownfield exploration in 2016 began to be fully 
felt with the accessing of increasingly narrower 
veins and a reduced number of stopes lowering 
production to 5.5 million silver equivalent 
ounces. We remain optimistic that, despite the 
impairment recognised in 2017, there is still 
geological potential in the Arcata deposit area 
and expect that our current drilling programme 
will enable an improvement in resource quality 
and quantity in the future. Finally, I am pleased to 
report that, during 2017, we achieved an 
excellent score in our newly implemented 
environmental corporate objective at all our 
operations. We will continue to work to maintain 
and improve our environmental culture and 
performance based on a strong belief that 
responsible mining is fully compatible with 
respect for the environment.
Exploration
Our ambitious brownfield exploration 
programme in Peru started to gain momentum 
in the second half of 2017 when, with all requisite 
permits in place, we were able to commence our 
surface drilling programmes at Inmaculada and 
Arcata. Early results from the first campaign in six 
years at Inmaculada are very encouraging and 
confirmed the presence of the Millet vein as well 
as eight other structures close to our mining 
infrastructure at the Angela vein. In Argentina, 
we had some success in discovering new 
structures close to the San Jose mine and we 
also continued to drill in the Aguas Vivas area to 
the north west where we are currently assessing 
the nature of this polymetallic orebody which has 
significant quantities of zinc and lead as well as 
precious metals. At Pallancata, the focus was on 
developing the Pablo vein in preparation for 
mining in 2018 whilst the discovery of the Marco 
vein nearby has added further resources and 
prompted a new regional geological hypothesis 
Brownfield
Optimising and exploring 
close to our current mines 
to increase life-of-mine  
and facilitate low cost  
plant expansion.
Greenfield
A reshuffled portfolio 
generating a number of 
promising targets in  
good geographies.
Acquisitions
T argeting early-stage 
opportunities with strong 
geological potential.
We are confident that our exploration-led growth strategy 
will continue to add high quality ounces to our existing 
assets, generate new early-stage projects and deliver  
long-term shareholder value.”

Our strategy for growth
Our strategy for growth focuses on three 
key paths to secure low cost growth.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 
Hochschild Mining plc 16 which we will be testing in 2018. Finally, at Arcata 
we were able to discover additional inferred 
resources and throughout 2018, an intensive 
campaign will continue to explore for resources 
with the goal of utilising the plant’s significant 
spare capacity.
Financial position
Strong cash flow from our operations  
combined with some balance sheet management 
opportunities has left us in a healthy financial 
position. On 23 January 2018, we were able to 
redeem the remaining $295 million of our 7.75% 
Senior Notes. We replaced a portion of these 
bonds with short to medium term debt from 
local banks in Peru with an average rate of 2.2% 
and approximately $100 million was repaid from 
existing cash resources. Consequently, our cash 
balance after this transaction remains a healthy 
$85 million and we expect our interest costs to 
fall by approximately $20 million per year from  
2019 onwards.
Financial results
Whilst an increased average gold price received 
was offset by a moderate fall in the silver price 
received, record production once again ensured a 
rise in revenue of 5% to $723 million (2016: $688 
million). The operational all-in sustaining cost of 
$12.3 per silver equivalent ounce (2016: $11.2 
per ounce) was in line with forecasts although 
the increase reflected an increased investment in 
brownfield exploration as well as one-off project 
costs at Inmaculada and consequently this 
resulted in Adjusted EBITDA of $301 million 
(2016: $329 million). Finally, with finance costs 
reduced despite the high yield bonds (now 
repaid), basic earnings per share and adjusted 
earnings per share was $0.08 per share (2016: 
$0.11 and $0.09 per share respectively). 
Outlook
We expect attributable production in 2018 to  
be 514,000 gold equivalent ounces (38 million 
silver equivalent ounces) driven by another 
240,000 gold equivalent ounces from 
Inmaculada, an increased contribution of 
9.5 million silver equivalent ounces from the 
revitalised Pallancata mine and another 
7.1 million silver equivalent ounces from the 
dependable San Jose mine. At Arcata, where we 
expect production of 4 million silver equivalent 
ounces, management will continue to closely 
monitor performance to ensure production 
is optimised whilst maintaining the asset´s 
optionality with regards to prices, exploration 
results and cost efficiencies. All-in sustaining 
costs for operations are expected at between 
$960 to $990 per gold equivalent ounce 
($13.0 to $13.4 per silver equivalent ounce) with 
the slight increase versus the $12.3 per ounce in 
2017 resulting from further development costs 
of the Pablo vein and a one-off highly profitable 
investment in a hydraulic backfill project at San 
Jose. We are also pleased to note that the 
corporate tax rate in Argentina has been reduced 
from 35% to 30% from 2018 (and to 25% from 
2020) and, hence we can look forward to a 
significant positive impact on San Jose’s net 
profitability although taxes on dividends have 
also been reinstated to 7% through to 2020  
and then to 13% thereafter.
A further $17 million is expected to be invested 
in our brownfield exploration in 2018 as we look 
to maintain the current momentum and an 
additional budget of $10 million is assigned to 
greenfield projects with some exciting prospects 
to be drilled in Peru, Chile, Canada and the 
United States. Low cost, early-stage acquisition 
opportunities will continue to be pursued across 
the Americas and, in particular, earn-in joint 
ventures where operations can benefit from 
Hochschild’s technical expertise. We are 
confident that our exploration-led growth 
strategy will continue to add high quality ounces 
to our existing assets, generate new early-stage 
projects and deliver long-term shareholder value.
