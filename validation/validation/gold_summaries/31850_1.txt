Strength  
in diversity
Diversification, investment, new business gains and strengthened customer 
relationships have all helped us to overcome the significant challenges posed  
by rising raw material costs and continuing intense price competition in the  
UK retail market place.
FRESH
Our core potato business, accounting for 
circa 78% of Group revenues during the 
year (2016: circa 78%), traded successfully 
through a less stable year, characterised  
by lower crop yields, resulting in higher raw 
material costs and retail price deflation. 
Although the planted area for UK potatoes 
increased by just over 4% in the 2016 
harvest, below average yields resulted in  
a 4% reduction in the total crop to 5.22m 
tonnes (2015 harvest: 5.43m tonnes). With 
demand outstripping supply throughout 
the year, input costs remained consistently 
high. However, Kantar World panel data for 
the fresh retail potato market showed a 
decline in market value of 3.5% during the 
year, on relatively static volumes, reflecting 
the continuation of intense competition in 
the supermarket sector.
We have benefited from our strategic 
approach in this challenging market, 
securing increased volumes with a major 
retail customer for a fixed period of three 
years through the adoption of a more 
collaborative and transparent approach  
to supply chain management. This has 
delivered improved efficiencies for both 
parties. We are also pleased to announce 
that we have won a third mainstream retail 
account, again for an initial fixed period of 
three years. Sales into the non-retail sectors 
of foodservice and wholesale also showed 
good growth during the year, and the 
launch of Linwood Crops at the start of the 
year as a subsidiary trading division will 
support further growth in these sectors.
Following completion of our packing site 
rationalisation programme in 2015, we now 
operate two efficient facilities in Scotland 
and Cambridgeshire, both of which are 
very well placed for both the major UK 
potato growing areas and distribution 
channels. We have continued to drive 
productivity through investment in these 
sites, which accounted for a significant 
proportion of the Group’s operational 
capital expenditure during the year of 
£4.8m (net of Peacock farm packing facility 
acquisition) (2016: £3.7m).
We have also continued our investment in 
IT, following the successful transition in 2015 
from in-house servers to a cloud-based 
external provider, thereby reducing the risk 
of business disruption and improving our 
contingency planning and disaster recovery 
capability. The focus this year has been  
on the installation of our new ERP system 
which, as noted in the interim report, 
resulted in some additional costs during  
a longer than expected implementation 
process. The roll-out across both our UK 
packing sites has now been completed 
and we are pleased to report that it has 
bedded in well, and that the expected 
planning and process efficiencies are 
starting to be realised.
Our growing arm had a successful year, 
benefiting from higher raw material prices. 
The increased order book in our fresh 
packing business also drove higher 
1. The growing cycle 
starts with top 
quality seed 
production nearly 
12 months  
in advance.
2. Planting of the 
ware crop takes 
place from February 
to April.
3. It takes about 
seven months to 
grow a field of main 
crop potatoes. The 
crop is sprayed to 
control weeds and 
guard against pests. 
The crop requires  
a lot of water to  
help it grow.
4. From June to 
September the crop 
is harvested into 
wooden boxes and 
taken to the farm.
5. The crop is quality 
controlled by eye  
to remove any 
unwanted potatoes 
before packing.
6. Nearly 250,000 
tonnes of potatoes 
are distributed 
every year.
FROM SEED TO TABLE

demand for seed, delivering a strong 
performance by our seed division. Our 
varietal development programme in this 
division continues apace, and we have a 
strong pipeline of new potato varieties 
coming through to market.
Our Cornish business of Rowe has had  
an average year growing, picking and 
marketing daffodils in a season that 
extends from late December to late April. 
Unfortunately rapid crop development 
resulted in an early harvest which 
compromised sales opportunities. 
Expansion of our production area has  
given us the opportunity to serve an 
extended customer base, enabling us to 
secure a number of new business wins 
during the year. In addition to daffodils, 
Rowe Farming also grows and supplies 
early potatoes from Cornwall, and made  
a successful start to the 2017 season.
Following a good and uninterrupted 
planting season, and subsequent 
favourable growing conditions, Jersey 
produced an excellent crop of new 
potatoes in 2017. Strong UK demand from 
the launch of the crop in late April into June 
ensured an equally successful sales season, 
and the performance of the business was 
further enhanced by our continued focus 
on cost control and efficiency gains.
PROCESSING
Our potato processing business has 
continued its recovery, benefiting from  
a new management structure and an 
ongoing focus on improved processes  
and efficiencies. We have invested in  
new cooking equipment and detection 
technology, extended our product  
range into the raw peel sector and  
gained new business as a result. The 
performance of the business was much 
improved in the closing months of the  
year and we are about to install a third 
production line in the factory to keep  
pace with growing demand.
OTHER
Our storage and ripening technology 
business enjoyed a better year, with 
recovery in two core markets. In addition, 
new member state chemical approvals 
within the EU have enabled Restrain to 
achieve a significant increase in its territorial 
reach within the last few months, giving 
solid grounds for optimism about its 
prospects in the year ahead.
FINANCES
The business remains cash-generative.  
An increase in net debt to £28.0m (2016: 
£18.1m) at the year end principally reflects 
our purchase during the year of a packing 
facility (land and buildings) in Jersey  
for £6.1m (cash), as well as higher stock 
valuations and increased trade receivables. 
Following the closure of Greenvale’s Kent 
packing facility in December 2015 we have 
removed all plant and machinery from the 
buildings and are confident that the sale  
of the site is now nearing completion.
PROSPECTS
The indications are that the planted  
area of potatoes in the UK has increased  
by approximately 4% for the second 
successive year. A timely planting season 
has been followed by variable growing 
conditions, and current predictions are  
for a 2017 crop that is of average yield  
and quality. If this proves to be accurate,  
it could deliver a gross yield as much as 9% 
greater than in 2016 at around 5.7m tonnes. 
This would usually indicate that we will 
have a season with more moderate raw 
material pricing compared with the 
2016/2017 season.
The diversity of our core business has 
delivered real benefits during the year 
under review. This proven model, the new 
retail business we have secured and the 
more transparent arrangements we have 
agreed with established customers, all give 
us increased confidence in our ability to 
achieve profitable growth in our established 
produce operations in the years ahead.

RESTRAIN
Turnover and profits have increased 
due to a recovery in core markets 
supported by additional regulatory 
approvals by EU member states.
The principal activity of the Company is the sale, 
lease and marketing of the Restrain system for  
the production and maintenance of a stable 
atmosphere of ethylene within potato and onion 
stores for sprout suppression and seed potato 
management. The system continues to provide the 
only residue free solution for sprout suppression in 
stored potatoes and onions in the UK, Europe and 
other territories across the world. Sales outside the 
UK continue to grow and the potential for growth  
in both new markets and products continue to be 
explored and management are excited and 
confident about the future. 12 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

ROWE FARMING
Rapid crop development resulted in 
an early harvest which comprised 
sales opportunities. Sales volume  
and value did increase during the 
year, as did costs. 
Rowe also harvest and sell a quantity of daffodil 
bulbs at the end of each season once they have 
been harvested, sorted, cleaned and sterilised. In 
recent years we have increased both the number  
of varieties grown, the acreage planted and have 
expanded production to Perthshire. This has been 
necessary to cope with increased demand at the 
end of the season (April).
