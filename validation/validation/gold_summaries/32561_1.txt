 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 06
Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review
Whitbread has had another year  
of strong growth and continued 
investment with total Group sales 
increasing 8.2% to £3.1 billion  
and underlying basic earnings  
per share increasing by 6.0%, 
demonstrating the strength of our 
core brands. Total basic earnings 
per share increased by 7.3%.
Strategic priorities
In 2016/17 we made good progress  
in delivering on our three strategic 
priorities: to grow and innovate in our 
core UK businesses; to focus on our 
strengths to grow internationally; and  
to build the capability and infrastructure 
to support long-term growth.
Premier Inn’s strong sales growth 
benefitted from the 3,816 gross new  
UK rooms we opened this year and the 
accelerated maturity of the c.9,000 
rooms we have opened over the last 
two years. We delivered high customer 
satisfaction by leading the market on 
quality and value, achieved occupancy 
of over 80% with record levels of direct 
bookings at 94%, all of which supported 
our strong return on capital.
Costa opened 255 net new stores 
worldwide and we continue to roll  
out our successful and fast growing 
Costa travel formats. Costa Express  
had a great year installing over  
1,500 machines of which 248 were in 
international markets. We are innovating 
to drive our sales growth and are 
pleased with the investment we are 
making to introduce ‘finer’ coffee 
concepts, leveraging our new state  
This is a significant year  
in Whitbread’s history  
as we celebrate our  
275th anniversary
I am delighted to be leading this great 
British company at this historic time and, 
with such a long and successful history,  
it is right that we take a long-term view 
of our business in order to safeguard  
the Company’s future for many  
more years to come.

of the art Roastery and delivering 
fresher food that our customers will 
enjoy later this year. 
Internationally, in Germany we grew  
our hotel pipeline to five hotels and  
our Frankfurt hotel received great  
guest feedback. We continue to have 
success with our profitable joint venture 
in the Middle East while our phased 
withdrawal from South East Asia is on 
plan. China remains an exciting platform 
of growth for Costa and we have a clear 
plan to enhance our business. We have 
launched five new concept stores,  
the results of which give us further 
confidence that we can capitalise  
on this market opportunity and grow  
to significant scale.
During the year we continued to 
strengthen our capabilities to support 
our long-term growth, including 
developing the senior team with a 
number of new hires and promotions.  
In November we announced a £150 
million cost efficiency programme  
to help offset investment and sector 
cost pressures. We have made good 
progress this year in areas such as 
procurement, supplier consolidation  
and labour scheduling, which has 
helped maintain margins.
In the year ahead we will continue  
to focus on organic growth and 
investing in our customer proposition. 
This, together with our efficiency 
programme and disciplined capital 
management gives us confidence  
in delivering another year of  
good progress, in line with overall 
expectations. Whilst we are only seven 
weeks into our new financial year 
Premier Inn has had a good start  
to the year and Costa has also seen 
positive like for like sales growth, 
although we remain cautious and 
expect a tougher consumer 
environment than last year. 
In the longer term we remain confident 
that, with our significant structural 
growth opportunities, the power  
of our brands and the investments  
we are making, we will continue to 
deliver strong returns and sustainable  
long-term growth for our shareholders.
More detailed information on our three 
strategic priorities can be found on 
pages 8 to 13.
2016/17 performance
Group underlying profit before tax rose 
6.2% to £565.2 million and underlying 
basic earnings per share increased 6.0% 
to 246.48 pence. Profit for the year was 
up 7.4% to £415.9 million and total basic 
earnings per share were up 7.3% to 
231.39 pence.
Premier Inn & Restaurants’ underlying 
operating profit was up 7.4% to  
£468.0 million. Premier Inn grew total 
sales by 9.0% and the number of rooms 
available by 9.3%, as we opened 3,816 
gross new UK rooms during the year, 
whilst achieving high total occupancy  
of 80.2%. Like for like sales grew by 
2.3%, benefitting from good RevPAR 
growth of c.1.4% in catchments where 
we did not add capacity and from our 
hotel extension programme which,  
as expected, diluted our like for like 
RevPAR by c.2%, but overall grew our 
like for like sales by c.1%. 
Restaurants’ total sales increased 1.2% 
benefitting from the eight net new sites 
opened during the year and like for like 
sales declined by 0.3%, slightly ahead  
of our competitor set.
Costa’s underlying operating profit  
was up 5.3% to £158.0 million, with total 
sales growth of 10.7%. This was driven 
by UK like for like sales growth of 2.0%, 
255 net new stores worldwide and an 
acceleration in our roll-out of Costa 
Express machines, with 1,585 net new 
installations. Margins were down  
0.8% pts, slightly ahead of our previous 
guidance due to the phasing of 
investments into 2017/18.
As we align our business towards our 
three strategic priorities we incurred  
a net non-underlying charge of  
£49.8 million (2015/16: £58.6 million), 
predominately relating to the estimated 
cost of Premier Inn International’s 
withdrawal from India and South East 
Asia and re-organisation costs 
associated with our cost efficiency 
programme.
The executive team
As Richard Baker mentioned in his 
statement, there has been some 
significant change to the executive  
team over the last couple of years and  
I am grateful to Nicholas Cadbury and 
Louise Smalley for the stability they  
have provided, which has enabled  
our leadership team to be refreshed  
so seamlessly.
I reported this time last year that 
Dominic Paul would be joining the  
team as Managing Director, Costa 
Coffee. Dominic joined us in June 2016, 
before which he was responsible for  
the success of Royal Caribbean outside 
the US. Dominic has hit the ground 
running, injecting energy and putting 
his personal stamp on our strategy  
for Costa.
In order to structure ourselves to  
meet our strategic objectives I took  
the decision to remove the Whitbread 
Hotels & Restaurants divisional 
infrastructure, with the aim of bringing 
the leadership team closer to the 
customer and enabling a leaner,  
more agile business, with faster 
decision-making. This led to a number 
of changes to my executive team.
Simon Jones was promoted to 
Managing Director of both Premier Inn 
& Restaurants and joined the Executive 
Committee. Simon joined Whitbread  
in 2011 and, since then, has been pivotal 
to the Premier Inn story, leading on key 
initiatives such as network planning, 
pricing and marketing.
Another internal promotion was  
Mark Anderson, who has been with  
the business for ten years and has led 
our property function since 2008.  
Mark now reports directly to me, which  
I believe appropriately reflects the 
importance of property to our business 
and the significant potential for value 
creation in this area. Mark also became 
Managing Director, Premier Inn 
International.
Our values
At Whitbread we believe that it is  
not just what you achieve, but how  
you achieve it. We aim to deliver great 
financial results for our shareholders, 
have a positive impact on communities, 
create fantastic career opportunities for 
our employees and great experiences 
for our customers, in a safe and 
welcoming environment. 
We intend to ensure that everyone  
who plays a part in delivering the 
products and services that our 
customers love is treated with respect 
and paid appropriately for their work. 
This applies not only to our 50,000 
team members, but also to the many 
people working across the world who 
contribute to Whitbread’s success.
I want to take this opportunity to thank 
everyone who makes Whitbread the 
company it is for their effort and 
commitment throughout the year  
and I am confident that we will work 
together to deliver on our strategic 
objectives in the years ahead and that 
we will do so in a way that will make  
us all proud.
