 Overview –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 7
We believe that the stem-cell sector is reaching a tipping
point in terms of the market’s understanding of its
potential to treat rare and life-threatening conditions; the
global stem cell market is currently valued at
c.US$96 billion and is predicted to grow to US$170 billion
by 2020 and US$270.5 billion by 2025, implying a CAGR of
13.8%. We are proud to be recognised as an intrinsic part
of this medical revolution.
Our integrated stem cell support services proposition
includes: CellPlan, the ﬁrst-of-its-kind stem cell insurance
plan; WideCells, our storage focused division leading the
way in the development and use of cell banking services;
and Wideacademy, which is driving education and
awareness on the stem cells sector. Each division made
signiﬁcant advances during the year as outlined below. 
As testimony to our commitment to both innovation and
education, in June 2017 the Group was ranked as the 21st
most disruptive company globally by DISRUPT 100, an
annual index celebrating the businesses with the most
potential to inﬂuence, change or create new global
markets. More recently, post period end, our CEO,
João Andrade, was awarded the CEO Europe Award 2018
by CEO Today Magazine.
CELLPLAN
CellPlan has developed the world’s ﬁrst stem cell
healthcare insurance plan and medical concierge service,
designed to revolutionise stem cell healthcare by making
stem cell transplants affordable for families who require
treatment for life threatening diseases. 
During the year, it made signiﬁcant advances bolstering its
innovative offering to create new revenue opportunities
and expand its service globally. It secured an agreement
with Biovault Technical Ltd, the UK’s largest private human
tissue storage facility (‘Biovault’), to roll-out CellPlan to
Biovault’s client base. Additionally, it launched its
e-commerce platform, www.cellplan.com, which allows
the Group to sell CellPlan directly to families, whether
existing or new clients. 
Although the UK stem cell market is comparatively small,
our initial launch in the UK has enabled us to trial our
offering. The aim is now to roll CellPlan out internationally
I am delighted to be part of this ground-breaking company and
deliver my inaugural statement as its Chairman; the prospects of
WideCells Group truly excite me. Through our three divisions, we
are focused on making stem cell treatment affordable and
accessible for families around the world. To this end, 2017 was
a year of building both our service offerings and our partnerships
with key players to position the Group as a multi-revenue
generative opportunity in a fast-growing sector. This resulted in an
inﬂection point with ﬁrst revenues generated before the year end.

and include additional product offerings over time. We are
set to launch in Spain imminently, and in support of this
have secured an agreement with Stem Cell Banco Celulas
Madre, S. A., an established provider of stem cell storage
services, to offer CellPlan to its clients, and will also launch
our e-commerce platform to ensure maximum market
penetration. A Deﬁnitive Agreement has also been secured
with Hemocord Clinica Medica Ltd in Brazil, a world-class
leader in cord blood storage, which is set to provide
CellPlan access to the largest cord blood storage market
in South America, a market projected to be worth
US$445 million by 2023.
In March this year WideCells announced a landmark deal
with Cryoviva Group, an established cord blood storage
facility with operations in Thailand, Singapore and India, to
sell CellPlan in Asia. Cryoviva has c.250,000 inspected
samples stored to-date which represents almost 9% of all
samples stored worldwide, with forecasts to store
c.25,000 new samples every year. CellPlan will be
launched to Cryoviva customers on a phased basis,
commencing in H2 2018, providing staged revenue
increases. 
Finally, with our storage division WideCells having recently
launched BabyCells, an umbilical cord blood and tissue
storage service which is available to clients in the UK and
Europe, additional synergistic growth opportunities are
available for CellPlan, as one year’s stem cell insurance
cover will be included as part of the initial storage
package.  It is our hope and expectation that this will lead
to ongoing uptake and revenue generation for CellPlan,
whilst also giving a competitive advantage to our storage
services. 
WIDECELLS
WideCells offers stem cell procurement, processing,
retrieval and storage services in the UK and Europe.
Through WideCells Brasil, it also operates a stem cell
laboratory in São Paulo, Brazil, licensed by the Brazilian
regulatory authority, the Agência Naciónal de Vigilância
Sanitáría (ANVISA). 
WideCells has established its own storage and processing
facility, called the Institute of Stem Cell Technology (‘ISCT’)
based at the University of Manchester Innovation Centre in
the UK, which is well positioned to capture an increasing
share of the cord blood banking market in the UK and
Europe. This provides the Group with exposure to
a fundamental part of the market; 4 million cord blood
samples are currently held in storage in 500 facilities
across the world and this is increasing by 250,000 a year. 
Whilst the Group had been offering umbilical cord stem
cells processing and storage services through a third-party
storage facility under its BabyCells brand in Portugal
between 2014 and early 2015, it was only post period end
in February 2018 that WideCells was awarded a Human
Application Licence by the UK’s Human Tissue Authority
(“HTA”). This licence permits the Group to procure, import,
export, process, store and distribute for treatment,
umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord tissue from the
UK and Europe at our ISCT facility in Manchester, UK. This
transformational milestone licence enables the Group,
under the brand name BabyCells, to offer affordable
umbilical cord blood and tissue storage services at the
highest standards to clients in the UK and Europe. Our
focus is now on promoting client-uptake and we are
actively looking for agents, initially focusing on Europe, to
promote our stem cell storage services. In support of this,
we believe we have a very strong product offering, as
alongside offering clients state-of-the-art storage services,
new BabyCells clients will be given a year’s stem cell
insurance cover, provided by our CellPlan division.
Going forward, WideCells intends to add additional stem
cell services such as dental pulp processing and storage
(TeethCells) and Adipose tissue collection, processing and
storage (LipoCells) to increase the Group’s stem cell
storage product offering. Furthermore, during the year
under review, WideCells secured a licence to provide
INDUS, a novel synthetic bone graft which promotes new
bone formation. The Group commenced selling this new
product in the UK in Q4 2017, initially targeting the dental
industry, with obvious potential for further roll out
internationally. 
Alongside our cryogenics facility at the ISCT, we have
a state-of-the-art laboratory which allows us to undertake
pioneering paid-for research projects to support the
continued development of the stem cell industry. Our
leading stem cell scientists have, for example, been
appointed by Qigenix, a California-based clinical stage
medical device company, to undertake research on its
behalf, testing a new laser technology designed to
increase the homing and integration of stem cells. By
supporting development, we ensure we remain at the fore
of the stem cell industry.
WIDEACADEMY
Spearheaded by Alan Greenberg, the former Director of
Apple Education, Wideacademy, the Group’s education
and training division, is focused on promoting
best-practice and quality, whilst driving innovation. By
helping people to understand this growing industry from
multiple perspectives and angles, Wideacademy will help
drive the uptake of our other products and services and in
turn investment across the entire sector, which ultimately,
could save many lives. The platform, which combines
free-to-access educational areas with paid-for premium
Chairman’s Review Overview –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 9
digital tools and resources for doctors and medical
professionals, was launched post period end and is already
receiving excellent feedback. 
Going forward, we intend to add additional functionality,
including access to educational modular courses that can
support Continual Professional Development (‘CPD’) for
medical professionals. The Group is currently in
discussions with a number of universities and educational
organisations to reﬁne its planned courses and CPD
offering. Wideacademy also intends to launch a Diseases &
Treatment section in H1 2018, to provide more detailed
information on speciﬁc illnesses.
CORPORATE
During the year, several corporate changes were
undertaken to reﬂect the Group’s transition from product
development into a revenue-generative, international
provider of stem cell services. Accordingly, we have
brought together individuals of outstanding quality who
have proven track records in the stem cell industry and
ﬁnancial sector. 
Directorship appointments included: Alan Greenberg,
previously Vice President of Wideacademy and a Group
Non-Executive Director, who became a Group Executive
Director and Group Chief Business Development Oﬃcer
whilst remaining Vice President of Wideacademy; Malcolm
Glaister, who has held a number of management roles
across a broad spectrum of leading investment and trading
businesses and joined as a Non-Executive Director; and
myself as Non-Executive Chairman, having previously held
several senior directorship positions with both large and
small companies in the insurance, healthcare and IT
industries. As part of these board changes, Dr. Graham
Hine, my predecessor as Chairman, retired from his board
role; I would like to thank him for all his work and support
in helping advance the Group to a point of international
growth and development. 
Post period end, David Henriques, who has signiﬁcant
asset management and corporate ﬁnance experience, and
is involved with the digitalisation of insurance products,
was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director.
He replaced Mr. Zakaria Aziz who stepped down from his
position as Non-Executive Director.
A new Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee consisting of leading
ﬁgures in the industry was also appointed. Responsible for
identifying and advising the Board on new developments
within the stem cell sector, the Committee will ensure that
we continue to address market demand and offer the
most competitive and innovative portfolio of services. 
Finally, post-period end, investors will be aware that
trading in our shares was suspended. This was a result of
a delay in publishing our ﬁnal results for 2017 pending
completion of the audit process, which in turn could not
be completed as we were in discussions with our ﬁnancial
advisers with a view to a fundraising. 
Having received commitments in respect of approximately
£1.47 million via a placing, and with a live market
bookbuild underway to bolster this further, we have been
able to successfully conclude the auditing of our annual
accounts. In light of this, we expect our trading
suspension to be lifted in the near term and are working
with the FCA to achieve this. 
I would like to assure shareholders that despite this
audit/corporate setback, all business operations have
continued to operate as usual and our growth prospects
remain strong. Our focus is ﬁrmly on achieving the
commercial roll-out of our stem cell services to build
revenues and ultimately drive the value of our business. 
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
We successfully raised £1.4 million before expenses in two
placings in 2017 on the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange. This has enabled us to set up our operations for
WideCells and Wideacademy in Manchester and for
CellPlan in Porto and we are on target to grow sales in
2018.
OUTLOOK
We are now focused on growth and the commercial
roll-out of products and services across all three divisions.
As well as our existing regions, we are exploring
opportunities in the Asia-Paciﬁc territories, where the stem
cell industry is gaining increasing proﬁle. Our preeminent
team and staff are leading the world in this exciting sector
and with their support, I anticipate steady growth during
the year. 
To conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to thank
our shareholders who provide ongoing support and look
forward to updating our progress on a regular basis.
