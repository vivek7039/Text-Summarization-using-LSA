Chairman’s statement
The Group has achieved growth in revenues from the  
core services of pawnbroking, retail and personal loans.  
We have improved store profitability and have also  
made progress in the development of our online channel 
although there is still considerable work to do.
Our est1897.co.uk site for watches is a great example of how we 
can successfully use the internet for retailing backed up by our 
store network. The opportunity to build on this concept for our 
core services is clear and will be a key part of our future strategy. 
These activities have repositioned the business within the wider 
alternative credit market and allowed the Group to access  
a broader customer base. The Board ensures that this growth  
is carefully managed with a clear focus on the changing risks, 
both regulatory and financial, that this diversification brings.
The growth in retail, FX and buyback also provide a degree  
of resilience to changes in the marketplace. 
Financial performance 
The Group delivered profit after tax of £11.3m (2016: £7.6m) and 
diluted earnings per share of 30.94 pence (2016: 20.88 pence). 
Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 6.2 pence 
per ordinary share (2016: 5.3 pence) will be paid on 1 June 2018  
to those shareholders on the register at the close of business  
on 4 May 2018. This will bring the full year dividend to 10.5 
pence per ordinary share (2016: 9.2 pence).
The Group’s financial position is strong with growth in the 
combined personal loan and pawnbroking loan books (net) to 
£63.8m (31 December 2016: £50.2m). As a result net debt increased 
to £13.3m at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £5.4m). 
At year end the Group had available headroom of £8.0m on its 
£30m borrowing facilities. I am pleased to report that in March 
2018 the facility was increased by £5.0m.
Regulation
H&T is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) for all consumer credit business. During the  
year the FCA conducted a consultation on creditworthiness  
and is expected to publish the results in 2018.
We engaged with the FCA through our trade associations and 
have analysed the proposals contained within the consultation. 
The consultation provides helpful guidance on effective 
creditworthiness assessments and clarifies some of the specific 
exemptions in relation to pawnbroking. Subject to the final 
policy statement we do not expect it to have an adverse impact 
on our business. We fully support the higher standards that the 
consultation aims to deliver. 
Strategy
We are developing our capabilities to address a changing market 
where we see pressures both on the high street in general and 
the core product of pawnbroking in particular. We are focussed 
on maximising the potential from the core services while 
investing in the development of new products and channels. 
This approach will allow us to improve profitability in the  
short term; in the longer term we can access a wider customer 
base and provide those consumers with products appropriate  
to their needs.
We believe that our network of stores supports this 
development, whether through click-and-collect from the 
est1897 website or by providing a face-to-face underwriting 
decision for customers we cannot serve with an online loan. 
This real-world presence supported by an effective online and 
mobile proposition creates an important distinction between 
H&T and a purely online business.
In developing our personal loan product, we have a clear 
objective to provide our customers with a route to lower 
interest rate credit products as their relationship with H&T 
develops. We believe that this progression is beneficial to the 
customer, builds loyalty and meets the high standards required 
in this regulated marketplace.
Prospects
The overall weakness in sterling following the EU referendum 
result has continued to benefit the sterling gold price for much 
of the year; this in turn provides an improvement in the Group’s 
profits while it continues. Demand for our services remains 
strong and the development in our products and distribution 
enables us to capture a larger share of the significant alternative 
credit market. 
Our thoughtful approach to growth reflects our intention  
to provide our consumers with a service that maintains  
the highest standards of affordability and seeks to avoid  
any consumer detriment.  
On behalf of the Board and our shareholders, I would like to 
thank everyone at H&T for their hard work and dedication over 
the past year.
