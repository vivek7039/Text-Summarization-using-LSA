 Chairman’s statement 
10 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 
 
 
A strong 2017 
2017 was a good year for Rath bones and we produced some 
robust financial results. The executive team responded well to 
developments in a rapidly changing wealth management market, 
and our investment managers achieved good risk-adjusted 
returns for our clients in a time of great uncertainty and 
persistently low interest rates.  
UK and global investment markets performed well in 2017, with 
some indices reaching record levels towards the end of the year. 
This outcome has been positive for both Rathbones and our 
clients, with the WMA Balanced Index up 7.2% in the year and  
our funds under management reaching £39.1 billion, up 14.3% in 
the year.  
Profit before tax for 2017 increased 17.6% to £58.9 million after 
incurring the costs associated with the relocation of our London 
office and in pursuing strategic opportunities. These costs were 
partially offset by a plan amendment gain arising from the closure 
of our defined benefit pension schemes. Accordingly, basic 
earnings per share of 92.7p in creased 17.5% from the 78.9p 
reported last year. A full analysis of all non-underlying items 
impacting profit before tax can be found on page 127. 
Underlying profit before tax was £87.5 million for the year ended  
31 December 2017, up 16.8% from the previous year, and we have 
continued to balance our need to continue strategic expenditure 
with maintaining good profitability, reporting an underlying profit 
margin of 30.6% (2016: 29.8%) for the year. Underlying earnings per 
share of 138.8p for 2017, increase d 13.7% from 122.1p last year.  
In line with our progressive dividend policy, the board is 
recommending a final dividend of 39.0p per share. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 61.0p per share, an increase of 7.0% 
over last year.  
We continually monitor opportunities to grow the business 
through smaller acquisitions, but during the year we discussed 
with an industry peer, Smith & Williamson, the benefits of 
combining our businesses. The benefits to both parties and our 
respective clients could have been considerable, but, following 
extensive discussions, we were unable to conclude a transaction 
that was in the best interests of both parties. Nevertheless,  
I believe that our measured approach to this opportunity served 
us well. We will continue to apply this discipline when we pursue 
other opportunities.  
Continued momentum  
In 2014, we set out a five-year strategy which had the ambition to 
reach £40 billion of funds under management by the end of 2018. 
Accepting that investment market s have been favourable, we are 
now well within sight of that goal with many of our strategic 
initiatives continuing to gain momentum.  
Accordingly, over the next few months, the board and executive 
team will work to refresh our strategy to ensure our core business 
remains robust and that we can benefit from the changing 
landscape of our industry. I look forward to sharing the outcome  
of these discussions with our stak eholders at the appropriate time. 
We remain committed to ensuring that Rathbones remain  
well positioned for the future. 
Governance, culture and the board  
Last year, I wrote that one of my priorities was to ensure board 
oversight of the firm’s culture and its development. This is  
now one of my specific responsibilities. Rathbones’ culture 
(professionalism, putting clients first, a collegiate approach  
and integrity) has long been a competitive advantage.  
Despite growth, regulation and the pace of change in our  
industry, we have endeavoured to protect our culture and this 
remains a board priority. 
As part of this initiative, both I and my non-executive director 
colleagues actively seek opportunities for direct engagement with 
employees, both formal and informal, across the firm. From our 
engagement this year, we have witnessed the challenging effects 
that an increased workload, driv en by internal and external 
change, has placed on our teams. On the other hand, we have 
been reassured that our strong culture remains at the heart of  
the business. Preserving this culture is clearly fundamental  
to achieving the best results for clients and shareholders over  
the long term.

As part of our normal succession planning, the board continues to 
monitor our existing capabilities and assess what new skills are 
necessary to develop both the boa rd and the wider business over 
time, taking into account the existing balance of knowledge, 
experience and diversity. After a rigorous recruitment process,  
we were delighted to welcome Jim Pettigrew to the board in 
March 2017. Jim has extensive experience in financial services  
and was appointed senior independ ent director in August 2017 
following the retirement of David Harrel. 
In late 2017, we completed an externally-facilitated board 
effectiveness review, which has confirmed that the board 
continues to operate well. There are always areas to improve 
however, and, in particular, we will ensure that good 
communication and interaction between the board and the 
business remains a priority. 
Responding to risks and regulation 
The report from the chairman of the group ri sk committee, 
Kathryn Matthews, is set out on page 68. We continue to enhance 
our risk management processes, and, this year, have paid 
particular attention to identifying and monitoring emerging risks 
such as cybercrime, money laundering and data theft. We remain 
vigilant to the financial risks associated with sub-letting our 
existing space in Curzon Street and these risks are also reviewed  
at every board meeting. We also took action to reduce the risks 
associated with our defined bene fit pension schemes. We believe 
that the other significant risks to our business are operational risks, 
which are increased by growth, and regulatory risks, which are 
increased by continual changes to regulations in our sector.  
The past year has been a very demanding one from a regulatory 
perspective as we prepared for the changes brought about by 
MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), the General 
Data Protection Regulation, the FCA’s Asset Management Market 
Report and PRIIPs (Packaged Retail and Insurance-based 
Investment Products). Maintaining our regulatory standards has 
always been a high priority for our senior management and we 
will continue to monitor the regulatory risks that arise from the 
changes to guidelines and standards in our sector. 
Engaging with shareholders 
During the year, we have had the opportunity to engage with 
shareholders through various channels including conferences, 
company-hosted events, group meetings and one-on-one 
discussions. We are fo rtunate to have a number of longstanding, 
committed institutional shareholders and will continue to 
maintain a regular and constructive dialogue with them to gather 
feedback on our progress.  
In early 2018, we consulted with them on changes to our 
remuneration policy. As it has been three years since our last 
policy was approved, a revised remuneration policy will be  
laid before shareholders for approval at the annual general 
meeting in May 2018. Working with the company’s advisers,  
the remuneration committee has reassessed our policy in the 
context of a changing external environment and the firm’s own 
future aspirations. Although we have maintained the principal 
features of our existing policy, some changes have been proposed 
to align the interests of executives and investors more closely. 
These changes follow a number of consultation meetings with 
shareholders and governing bodies. 
Listening to our employees  
As a service business, our people are our greatest asset and we are 
committed to retaining the many high-calibre individuals we 
employ across the firm and creating a stimulating and supportive 
environment for them. I listen carefully to the views of my 
colleagues and I recognise that this year has been a challenging 
one for employees, given the pace and nature of change. I am very 
grateful for their continued perseverance and dedication. 
Outlook 
The UK wealth management industry continues to evolve, driven 
by client needs, regulation, demographics, technological 
innovation and a changing competitive landscape. Rathbones, as a 
leading UK discretionary wealth manager, remains well placed to 
respond to and capitalise on these evolving trends. 
We remain committed to growing the business both organically, 
via disciplined investment, and inorganically, via acquisitions that 
not only fit our strategic and financial criteria, but also share our 
culture and values.  
Notwithstanding some caution, which naturally emerges at a time 
of high investment markets and political uncertainty, we enter 
2018 well positioned to provide long-term value for shareholders.
