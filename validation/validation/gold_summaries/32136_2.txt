OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We export the best of M&S Clothing & 
Home and Food around the world, with stores 
across Europe, Asia and the Middle East. 
We also have a growing international online 
business. Following a strategic review of 
our International business, we are focusing 
on our established joint venture and 
franchise partnerships and operating fewer 
wholly-owned markets.
In January 2007, we launched Plan A to 
address the key environmental, social and 
ethical challenges facing M&S. After ten years 
and two further updates, Plan A continues 
to lead the sustainable business agenda. 
This year we are launching a new set of 
commitments which have been developed 
to transition Plan A into a new way of working 
and engaging with our customers.
