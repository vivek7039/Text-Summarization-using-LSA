Chairman’s statement
In a year characterised by 
significant political events and 
the market uncertainty that 
inevitably comes with that, I am 
pleased to say that Workspace 
has performed strongly. The 
resilience of the business, 
underpinned by the right 
strategy and a clear customer 
focus resulting in ongoing 
demand for our offer, reinforces 
our conviction around our 
business model.
As Jamie, our Chief Executive, 
outlines in his statement, we 
have seen the market move 
more and more towards our 
proven strategy. Over the year, it 
has become clear that the 
Workspace Advantage, our high 
quality, connected space and 
tailored customer offer, is 
attractive to businesses from 
many different sectors at any 
stage in their life cycle.
We have continued to deliver 
strong results with a 6.9% 
increase in net rental income, to 
£79.2m, and a 3.3% increase in 
EPRA NAV per share, to £9.53.
Our focus is on driving income 
across our portfolio, efforts 
which have been enhanced 
during the year by the successful 
letting up of our completed 
projects. Thanks to this focus, 
and the strong trading profit 
growth we delivered as a result, 
the Board is recommending a 
40% increase in the interim and 
final dividend for the period. This 
is in line with our progressive 
dividend policy and, of course, 
our distribution requirements as 
a Real Estate Investment Trust 
(“REIT”). It also demonstrates 
the Board’s confidence in the 
future success of the business.
Looking forward, with a strong 
pipeline of refurbishments and 
redevelopments, ongoing 
demand for our space from a 
growing customer market and a 
strong balance sheet to take 
advantage of further acquisition 
opportunities, I feel confident in 
Workspace’s ability to deliver 
value to shareholders over the 
long term.
Daniel Kitchen
Non-Executive Chairman
This success was delivered 
through the hard work and 
commitment of everyone at 
Workspace. We genuinely think 
differently in this business, with 
each individual adopting a 
customer-first mentality, 
innovative thinking and bringing 
deep market knowledge to their 
various roles, whether on the 
ground in our centres or in our 
marketing, systems development 
or finance teams at head office. 
The Board and I thank all our 
colleagues, as well as our 
suppliers and partners, for their 
part in delivering the Workspace 
Advantage.
We work hard to deliver that 
advantage to our customers but 
also to all the stakeholders we 
have relationships with. I am 
particularly proud of the work 
the business has done this year 
in inspiring London’s young 
people through providing work 
experience placements with our 
customers, helping to place 
apprentices with our suppliers 
and holding CV workshops in 
our centres. We regularly 
consider the positive role we can 
play in London and the duty of 
care we have to the wider 
community in which we operate.
London continues to be the right 
market for Workspace and it 
holds significant growth 
opportunities for us. Clearly, this 
is not without risk, and share 
prices across the real estate 
sector were impacted following 
the EU Referendum last June 
amid concerns that London 
would lose its unique attraction 
as a centre for business. 
Operationally, we saw no such 
impact on demand but we 
remain alert to the risks that 
further political and economic 
uncertainty could bring to the 
business. 3 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
