*  The Group defines adjusted profit before taxation as statutory profit before tax and amortisation of intangible assets, share-based payment charges and 
IFRS-related discount charges. We believe that this measure of performance eliminates factors which distort period-on-period comparisons in order to provide a 
more comparable position year on year. We believe this information is useful to shareholders and analysts in providing a basis for measuring our financial performance.
