 Looking towards the future 
• I am pleased to report that our research, 
understanding and ambition to find more 
effective solutions to the treatment of 
cancer have moved on substantially in 2017. 
• The progress of our core clinical products, 
VAL201 and VAL401 has been substantial 
and both have reached significant value 
inflection points. The current momentum 
and exciting trajectory of both compounds 
offer potential investors an investable 
proposition and an attractive offering  
to joint venture partners.
• A particularly noteworthy achievement by 
the Company in the reporting period was 
the successful completion of the VAL401 
Phase ll clinical study in patients with late 
stage non-small cell lung cancer, the most 
common form of lung cancer.
• During the period, we saw consistent 
progress made with our VAL201 therapeutic, 
culminating in receiving approval from 
the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency and the Research Ethics 
Committee to substantially expand and 
accelerate the trial for locally advanced 
or metastatic prostate cancer. This gives 
the trial increased flexibility and speed for 
reaching therapeutic levels and to reduce 
disease progression.
• The integration of our clinical in-house 
team with a board of oncologists and 
clinical nurse specialists has been providing 
valuable insight into how we can more 
rapidly bring safe, efficacious, therapeutic 
and palliative medicines to cancer patients 
to meet hitherto unmet needs in rapidly 
growing markets.
• The Company has also progressed the pre-
clinical pipeline. The programmes currently 
consist of VAL301, which is derived from the 
formulation of VAL201 and the compound 
VAL101, which is derived from our GeneICE 
technology platform. The Company is very 
much looking forward to taking the next 
generation of therapeutics into further 
development and through to the clinic.
• VAL401 and VAL201 have received several 
major patent grants and the IP portfolio 
now covers all major areas worldwide.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
In my report for the year ended 
31 December 2016, I informed 
our shareholders that we were 
making important strides in 
growing our internal R&D 
capabilities, such that we remain 
at the forefront of personalised 
and precision medicine. 
I am pleased to report that our research, 
understanding and ambition to find more 
effective solutions to the treatment of cancer 
have moved on further since then. The 
integration of our in-house team with an 
advisory board of oncologists and clinical  
nurse specialists has been providing valuable 
insight into how we can more rapidly bring  
safe, efficacious, therapeutic and palliative 
medicines to cancer patients to meet hitherto 
unmet needs.
In 2017, we saw consistent progress made 
with our first therapeutic. VAL201 continued 
to demonstrate high safety and tolerability, 
as well as preliminary therapeutic activity 
throughout the clinical study, culminating in 
receiving approval from the UK Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and 
the Research Ethics Committee to substantially 
raise the dosing level in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic prostate cancer in 
order to reach therapeutic levels and reduce 
disease progression. This is a testament to the 
appetite for new drugs devoid of the serious side 
effects reported with current prostate cancer 
treatments, in particular complete and general 
androgen hormone deprivation. We look forward 
to reporting on the clinical trial as it progresses 
throughout this current year.
In parallel, we continued to advance the 
reformulation of VAL201 into VAL301 for the 
treatment of Endometriosis, a painful and 
debilitating gynaecological condition with high 
unmet clinical needs. We have established from 
our pre-clinical studies that VAL201’s specific 
mode of action also has the potential to provide 
a potent therapeutic effect to manage the 
symptoms of this disorder more safely than 
current treatments, which are widely known to 
cause a large number of side effects including 
loss of bone density and/or infertility. Going 
forward, the Company’s focus is to complete 
laboratory tests before progressing VAL301  
to clinical trials.
A particularly noteworthy achievement by 
the Company in the reporting period was the 
successful completion of the VAL401 Phase ll 
clinical study in patients with late stage non-
small cell lung cancer, the most common form 
of lung cancer. The data analysed by Ariana, 
a leading digital health Company, focused on 
developing advanced therapeutic decision

Financial Statements
In conclusion, I believe the Group has seen 
substantive and encouraging developments 
across its portfolio during the period to 
December 2017. The progress of our core 
clinical products, VAL201 and VAL401 has been 
substantial and both have reached significant 
value inflection points. The current momentum 
and exciting trajectory of both compounds offer 
potential investors an investable proposition and 
an attractive offering to joint venture partners. 
I would like to take this opportunity to express 
my sincere gratitude to all shareholders, fellow 
Directors, and every member of the Group for 
the trust and support accorded to the Board  
in positioning ValiRx among the frontrunners in 
the fields of personalised and precision medicine.

support systems, has advocated the therapeutic 
potential for VAL401 as a single therapy in 
treating this cancer. Ariana has also advocated 
the compound’s therapeutic and palliative 
potential when combined with both traditional 
chemotherapies and immune-oncology 
treatments. Palliative stage patients could  
expect to see improvements in symptoms 
with the added benefit of improved survival 
prospects. The encouraging 60% overall 
response rate provides a strong foundation for 
the next stage of clinical testing. The measure 
of immune competency of the treated patients 
was also a pleasingly unexpected addition to the 
results. In sum, we are very excited to see such 
a good response rate for a condition with huge 
unmet medical need. 
Furthermore, these results came hot on the 
heels of ValiRx receiving notification that a 
further method-of-treatment patent has been 
granted by the US Patent Office covering the 
use of VAL201 in the treatment of prostate 
cancer. VAL201 now has five patents families 
in its portfolio, four of which have been fully 
granted and with one allowed. VAL201’s patent 
protection now extends across territories that 
include US, Japan, Australia, Europe and the UK, 
providing coverage in the world’s major markets.
Another important breakthrough during the 
year was the development of an optimised, 
commercially viable second generation of the 
VAL101molecule derived from our proprietary 
GeneICE platform, which has been shown 
in earlier studies to shut down rebellious 
genes causing cancer and potentially some 
neurological disorders. We can now take 
VAL101 in to late pre-clinical studies in 
preparation of the compound’s entry 
into the clinic.
Our financial results show the total 
comprehensive loss for the year ended 31 
December 2017 was £3,019,684, a decrease of 
36.40% on the previous year (2016: £4,748,003) 
and a loss per share from continuing operations 
of 1.90p (2016: Loss 8.54p). This marked reduction 
in our loss was attributable to a decrease in 
clinical trial expenditure as the manufacturing 
costs for both of the investigational medicinal 
products, VAL201 and VAL401, that were incurred 
for their respective trials, were borne during 2016.
In December 2017, we announced the final 
conversion of the CLN Agreement with Yorkville 
– thus resulting in no further obligations existing 
with Yorkville. Simultaneously, we raised £1.0m 
of gross proceeds through the issue of 23,529,412 
new ordinary shares at a price of 4.25 pence  
per share for advancing the clinical trial of 
VAL201 and for the pre-clinical progress of  
other programmes. As at year-end, the Group 
had cash and cash equivalents of £701,41  
(2016: £560,763). 
How we manage our company
The Board
At 31 December 2017, the board consisted of three executive and 
two non-executive directors, who are well respected within their 
field. The Board sets the overall direction and strategy of the Group, 
reviews scientific, operational and financial performance, and advises 
on management appointments. All key operational and investment 
decisions are subject to Board approval, with the Company Secretary 
being responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed 
and applicable rules and regulations are complied with. The Non-
Executive Chairman is responsible for overseeing the running of the 
Board, ensuring that no individual or group dominates the Board’s 
decision-making and ensuring the Non-Executive Directors are properly 
briefed on matters. The Chief Executive Officer has the responsibility for 
implementing the strategy of the Board and managing the day to day 
business activities of the Group.
All of the Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
Annual General Meeting (’AGM’) after their appointment to the Board 
and to re-election by shareholders at least once every three years.
I believe the Group has  
seen meaningful and 
encouraging developments 
across its portfolio during 
the period to December 
2017. The progress of our 
core clinical products, 
VAL201and VAL401 has 
been substantial and both 
have reached significant 
value inflection points.  
The current momentum  
and exciting trajectory of 
both compounds offer 
potential investors an 
investable proposition  
and an attractive offering  
to joint venture partners.”
