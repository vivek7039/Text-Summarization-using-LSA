online, with the catalogue in many cases 
forming part of the browsing journey. We 
are making that process seamless for 
customers by investing to ensure that we 
always have online channels that meet 
their expectations.
We also have to be alert to changing 
patterns of use and expectation of service 
levels. 63% of Express Gifts’ customers 
ordered online last year. However, in 
Spring this year we have seen over 80% 
of our new customers that we have 
recruited placing their first orders online. 
At some point in the future we will see 
this figure inevitably approaching 100%. 
We are planning now for the investment 
and transformation required to keep pace 
with this digital evolution.
Maximising our potential
Broadly speaking, our businesses have 
operated on a standalone basis over the 
last few years, with little focus on Group 
synergies. This was logical at a time when 
the smaller business units may have 
been under consideration for disposal. 
However, with the Group structure now 
established, we can see several areas 
going forward where we can better 
utilise our resources to drive value and 
efficiency. We are already working on 
two areas of opportunity. Firstly, we have 
moved our small plc‑ team from Hyde 
(where Findel Education is headquartered) 
to Accrington (where Express Gifts is 
based). By doing this, we can share the 
plc finance and business support functions 
with those of Express Gifts to share skills 
and make efficiency savings. Secondly, 
we are encouraging Findel Education to 
make greater use of our own Far East 
sourcing offices, which have increasingly 
moved away from their Hong Kong 
heritage in favour of the Chinese industrial 
Recent years have seen Findel make 
significant progress in restructuring and 
simplifying the Group. In Express Gifts 
and Findel Education we now have two 
core businesses that we believe have 
the potential to generate significant 
incremental shareholder value over the 
coming years. My challenge as CEO is 
to build on the good work of the last few 
years and put in place the strategies and 
actions to unlock that potential, whilst 
eliminating the individually significant 
charges and legacy cash outflows that 
have undermined our recent performance.
Customers are at the heart of our 
businesses
We must continue to put the customer in 
both businesses at the heart of everything 
we do, by listening to customers and 
through delivering excellent product 
choice and quality at every‑ day good 
value.
To better improve our offer, we are 
constantly seeking to understand the 
following from our customers:
• Why do they shop with us rather than 
our competitors and vice versa?
• How can we improve their shopping 
experience to convince them to come 
back to us in future?
• How can we encourage them to spend 
a greater proportion of their wallet 
with us?
Our business models are adapting to 
cater for a marketplace that is increasingly 
moving online. The paper catalogues 
used by both businesses will remain a 
key element of our marketing for some 
time, as that’s what our customers tell 
us that they want. However, we also 
know that increasingly they want to shop 
areas where goods are manufactured. 
By revisiting that opportunity, Findel 
Education has identified a number of 
new suppliers who can provide better 
quality products at significantly lower 
prices, allowing us to pass savings onto 
our customers whilst protecting margins. 
They have also identified opportunities 
where they could buy from the same 
sources as Express Gifts, so both can gain 
bulk discounts. We will explore further 
ideas over the coming months in order 
to maximise the efficiencies of our two 
businesses.
Whilst the future opportunities look 
exciting and the rate of customer 
growth at Express Gifts remains strong, 
we cannot escape the fact that our 
financial performance during FY17 was 
disappointing and below the expectations 
that we set ourselves. However, we 
have addressed a number of judgemental 
issues in these results and, whilst the 
increased provisions for past financial 
services matters are necessary, it is right 
that we address these issues now for the 
benefit of our customers.
Leadership
As Ian has indicated in his Chairman’s 
Statement, I have a new executive 
leadership team in place. It comprises 
the two divisional managing directors, 
Paul Kendrick of Express Gifts and 
Chris Mahady of Findel Education, along 
with our acting CFO, Stuart Caldwell, 
and our Company Secretary, Mark 
Ashcroft. Together, we are focused on 
sustainable, improved profit performance 
in both businesses leading to improved 
shareholder returns.
Chief Executive’s Review
“ The last year has seen further building blocks 
put in place to enable the Group to deliver on 
its medium‑ term plans. While the reported 
performance was disappointing, the new 
leadership structure we now have in place will 
support the delivery of future growth.”

Chief Executive’s Review I Strategic Report
Brexit
In line with the wider retail sector, the 
decision to leave the European Union has 
had an impact on import costs. Express 
Gifts’ goods are generally manufactured 
outside the UK, so exposing us to the 
fluctuations in Sterling at some point in 
the supply chain. Where that exposure 
is seen directly, namely where we 
buy in US$ or euros which represents 
around a third of total purchases, we are 
well‑placed with hedging policies in place 
to cover planned purchases on a rolling 
12‑ month basis. That provides time for 
us to adapt our supply chain, so mitigating 
the impact upon our customers. Indirect 
exposures are managed similarly through 
discussion with suppliers and reviewing 
our internal processes.
All of Express Gifts’ customers are 
based in the UK, and Findel Education’s 
international customers buy in Sterling.
Performance in FY17
Express Gifts saw continued progress in 
FY17, particularly in acquiring a significant 
number of new customers in a cost‑ effective way and retaining more of its 
established customers. The use of TV and 
social media in our recruitment approach 
will inevitably attract a broader audience 
than just our target customer, but the 
proportion of new customers taking credit 
terms is in line with our expectations. 
The new Philippines‑ based operation 
increased our capacity to handle inbound 
enquiries, but we also made substantial 
improvements to its online systems to 
make it easier for customers to trade with 
us and handle any queries they may have 
without the need to physically contact us. 
The business navigated through the sharp 
changes to exchange rates in June 2016 
and made further improvements to the 
way we use our Far East sourcing office. 
However, the combination of increased 
investment in customer recruitment in Q4 
and requiring additional currency at lower 
than average rates to source goods to 
support it, impacted profit in the year by 
around £2.0m.
Findel Education continued to see 
challenging market conditions, with 
price competition for the commodity‑ based School brands being particularly 
intense and leading to a further loss in 
market share. It did, however, manage to 
regain lost customers for its Classroom 
and Specialist brands. Importantly, it 
completed its warehouse consolidation 
project on time, on budget and without 
disruption to customers.
The Group’s underlying cash generation 
remained strong, providing the basis for 
reinvestment into customer growth and 
system improvements.
However, the headline results fell short of 
our expectations, and were accompanied 
by a number of individually significant 
items that produced a significant net loss.
Focus for the year ahead
The building blocks put in place to enable 
the Group to deliver on its medium‑ term 
plans provide a strong platform for growth 
and I am very excited about the prospects 
for the Group as we enter the new 
financial year.
Looking ahead, we are confident in 
delivering against the respective strategies 
of both businesses. At Express Gifts 
we are focused on further growth in 
customers and share of wallet, while 
at Findel Education we will continue to 
address market share losses through 
better use of great value product, service 
and its new online channels. The Group 
will also increase its risk management 
resource, aimed at improving the 
resilience of the Group.
