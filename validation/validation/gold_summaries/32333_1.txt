Chief Executive’s review
HomeServe has had another very 
good year with strong underlying 
performance enhanced by foreign 
exchange tailwinds. Affinity partner 
households increased by 10m to 
102m, with a significant increase in 
North America. This is in addition 
to 11% Group customer growth, 
with customer numbers now at 
7.8m. Statutory operating profit was 
up 20% to £104.7m, and adjusted 
operating profit increased 22% to 
£118.8m, both included a £10.3m 
foreign exchange benefit.  
A solid performance in the UK delivered 
over half of the Group’s operating profit, 
while we also continued to invest in new 
partnerships, network capability, LeakBot 
and heating services. 
The business in North America had 
a transformational year, completing 
the acquisition and integration of 
Utility Service Partners Inc. (USP) 
while continuing to sign new partners 
organically. As a result, we made rapid 
progress towards the targeted 80m 
affinity partner households, where 18m 
households were added during FY17, 
taking total access to 50m households. 
Organic customer growth was 10% and, 
together with USP, customer numbers 
increased to 3.0m, up 28% on the prior 
year. 
We have seen good customer growth 
and profit progression in our established 
businesses in France and Spain with 
customer numbers increasing 4% to  
1.0m and 7% to 1.3m respectively. The 
Group retention rate was strong at 82% 
(FY16: 83%).
We invested £6.0m in the New Markets 
segment, as planned (FY16: £5.9m). Our 
Italian business established a joint venture 
with Edison Energia and we progressed 
our expansion into new countries and 
development of an online on demand 
home repair and improvement offering  
– our “Home Experts” platform. 
Our investment in Checkatrade and 
acquisition of Habitissimo are a major 
step forward and position us at the fore  
of the online revolution we are seeing  
in home services. The Home Experts 
online platform will connect a wider 
consumer demographic to a broader 
range of expert tradespeople. 9
