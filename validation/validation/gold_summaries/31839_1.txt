STRA TEGIC
REPORT
Smiths has seen a year of good 
progress, amidst a world of 
uncertainty and an unprecedented 
pace of technology development. 
I set out my ambition of establishing 
Smiths as one of the world’s leading 
technology companies in September 
2016, and we’ve spent the past 12 months 
doing what we said we were going to do. 
FY2017 performance
We delivered a good performance in 
FY2017, with underlying revenue broadly 
in line with the prior year. We saw growth 
across the portfolio offset by John 
Crane’s oil & gas business and in Smiths 
Medical due to market challenges in John 
Crane and a delay in some new product 
launches in Smiths Medical. Group 
revenue grew 11% on a reported basis, 
benefiting from foreign exchange, and in 
particular the strength of the US dollar, 
partially offset by the impact of four 
divestitures and the acquisition of 
Morpho Detection.
The underlying quality of our businesses 
and the increasing impact of the Smiths 
Excellence System supported a strong 
headline operating profit performance of 
£589m, up 3% on an underlying
1
 basis 
and up 16% on a reported basis. The 
Group’s headline operating profit margin 
increased 70 basis points on a reported 
basis, with margin expansion in all 
divisions reflecting our focus on 
operational efficiency and the upgrading 
of the portfolio. 
Strategy update
We’ve made good progress against our 
strategic objectives of outperforming our 
chosen markets and delivering world-
class competitiveness, supported by our 
strong financial framework. 
Sustainable growth and attractive 
returns are what we’re about and we’ve 
moved forward on repositioning the 
portfolio and establishing the 
organisational building blocks to deliver 
on our ambition. This is helping to 
establish Smiths as a high-performing 
diversified Group with high-quality 
businesses that are well-positioned in 
growing markets, with active portfolio 
management, a clear operating model, 
and a culture of relentless execution and 
continuous improvement.
Outperforming our chosen markets
The repositioning of the business for 
growth through organic and inorganic 
investment is well underway and we 
have made excellent progress. With 
the sale of four non-core assets and 
the completion of the Morpho Detection 
acquisition – creating a true world 
leader in this market – around 75% of 
our portfolio is now well positioned by 
market and competitiveness, up from 
60% eighteen months ago, and we expect 
further progress in the coming year.
Our goal is a portfolio of businesses 
that hold sustainable top three 
positions in attractive markets and 
demonstrates the key characteristics 
of a Smiths business: asset-light and 
competitive operations, technology 
differentiation, a high proportion of 
aftermarket revenues and increasing 
digitisation. Organic growth will always 
be my top priority but we expect to 
run a carefully considered parallel 
path of acquisition and divestiture to 
accelerate our repositioning globally.
An example of our work to reposition 
the portfolio is the focusing and 
restructuring of Smiths Interconnect.

DE VELOPING A CULTURE OF INNOVATION WITH 
AN ECOSYSTEM TO DRIVE FA STER DE VELOPMENT  
AND COMMERCIALISATION OF NE W PRODUCTS IS 
CRUCIAL TO OUR SUCCESS TODAY AND TOMORROW
We sold non-core assets representing 
around 40% of revenue and the 
remaining core is now positioned as a 
faster-growing leader in high-speed 
secure connectivity for demanding 
markets such as space, defence and 
commercial aerospace, and ready 
to develop further. There are similar 
examples elsewhere in the portfolio.
We have also increased our focus on 
key higher-growth regions, including 
relocating one of our Executive 
Committee members, Roland 
Carter, to Asia as Smiths Group 
President of Asia Pacific to head up 
our growth drive in the region.
Driving world-class competitiveness
As we increasingly focus the Group 
on the most attractive end markets 
with good long-term profitable growth 
prospects, it is critical that we establish 
the capabilities to ensure relentless 
execution. This has been a priority 
during the last year and we have 
been driving three areas: operational 
excellence, innovation and people.
Many years in the hard-fought automotive 
world have taught me that all customers, 
whatever their industry, value speed 
and efficiency, and that’s the essence of 
the Smiths Excellence System (SES). 
SES gives us a shared operating model 
that will help us to apply best practice to 
drive speed, efficiency and a culture of 
continuous improvement, right across 
the Group. Results are already starting to 
come, with around £40m in procurement 
savings and an £85m reduction in 
working capital of which £52m is 
reduction in total stock over the past year, 
helping us to fund investment in growth. 
And I’m convinced there is more to follow 
over the next 12 months and beyond.

performance in FY2018 to be weighted 
towards the second half. Growth in 
John Crane’s non-oil and gas markets, 
as well as an increase in aftermarket 
activities, is expected to more than offset 
the challenging market conditions in 
oil and gas. We expect the introduction 
of new products during the year to 
support a gradual improvement in 
Smiths Medical. In Smiths Detection we 
anticipate a strong second half-driven 
by the transportation market, which will 
generate good growth for the year as a 
whole. In Smiths Interconnect, our focus 
on fewer, higher-growth end markets 
will support further good progress in 
this division, while Flex-Tek is expected 
to deliver continued steady growth. 
We are increasingly confident that we’re 
establishing the operating model for 
excellence and leadership capability 
to deliver long-term sustainable 
growth and attractive returns. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend per share of 29.70p, giving a 
total dividend for the year of 43.25p, an 
increase of 3% year-on-year. The final 
dividend will be paid on 17 November 
to shareholders registered at close 
of business on 20 October. The ex-
dividend date is 19 October.
We’ve made good progress on our 
journey to establishing Smiths as 
one of the world’s leading technology 
companies over the past year 
and I’d like to sincerely thank my 
22,000 colleagues around the world 
for their dedication, contribution 
and absolute professionalism. I 
look forward to reporting further 
progress in the coming months.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Technology is moving faster than ever 
before and we‘re committed to being 
at the cutting edge. It’s essential 
that we’re technology leaders, 
defining new ways to bring value to 
our customers and developing new 
business models for the future. 
Developing a culture of innovation with an 
ecosystem to drive faster development 
and commercialisation of new products 
is crucial to our success today and 
tomorrow. Our Group-wide innovation 
framework, i

, will consistently drive 
increased, smarter investment in R&D 
and convert it into sales more quickly. I 
believe that it will differentiate us in our 
markets, make our customers happier 
and make us sustainable. We have 
already increased our R&D spend to 
4.6% of revenue and created a central 
Innovation Fund to build digital and other 
disruptive technology capabilities – such 
as 3D printing and nano technology – and 
create critical mass where individual 
divisional efforts would be sub-scale. 
We have announced two digital forges, 
with one in Silicon Valley and another 
planned in London, to help accelerate 
our digital transformation. These 
forges are global centres of excellence, 
helping us define new digital business 
models and build Group-wide capability 
in areas of focus including artificial 
intelligence, analytics and data security.
This is not just about planning for the 
future – we are already generating 
meaningful revenue from digital. 
Nor is it just digital technology to 
complement existing businesses – it’s 
about defining new business models for 
the future and ensuring we are ahead 
on the capabilities they will require. 
I was also pleased to announce our 
strategic partnership with Microsoft 
to further accelerate our market-
leading artificial intelligence-
based detection capability in the 
ports and borders market.
The final, critical area of focus for 
us is people – our one true source of 
sustainable competitive advantage. 
Our people plan is aimed at building 
a learning organisation that attracts, 
retains, develops, engages and 
inspires the very best people around 
the world to deliver our ambition. 
We’ve made good progress during 
the year, including launching a new 
leadership development programme 
in partnership with UCLA Anderson 
Executive Education, a new approach 
to measuring employee engagement, 
a Group-wide communication plan to 
help everyone understand the part 
they play, and the adoption of our new 
‘Smiths Way’ of working, including 
shared values and approaches to 
how we do things across the world. 
Those shared values of integrity, respect, 
ownership, customer focus and passion 
underpin our commitment to doing the 
right thing, every time, no matter our 
role. Keeping our people safe is our 
top priority and I’m particularly proud 
of our performance this year, with our 
lowest ever Recordable Incident Rate. 
That said, I truly believe that any injury 
is one too many and we will continue 
to strive for our goal of zero harm. 
Looking ahead
The progress delivered in executing 
our strategy through portfolio 
repositioning and disciplined organic 
and inorganic investment has ensured 
that we’re well positioned for the Group 
to return to growth in FY2018. As in 
previous years, we expect Group
