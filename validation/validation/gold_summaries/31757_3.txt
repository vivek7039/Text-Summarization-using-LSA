Chairman’s Statement
REVIEW OF THE YEAR
The financial year ended 2 September 
2017 was a challenging year as the 
Group’s financial performance was 
impacted by external factors affecting 
both divisions which were highlighted  
in our trading update on 20 July 2017. 
Despite this, the year was also one  
of investment and significant progress 
towards achieving the Group’s medium 
term strategic objectives.
In our Agriculture division, while the UK 
business benefited from a recovery in 
farmgate milk prices and consequently 
improved farmer confidence, sales 
volumes in our USA feed block business 
were affected throughout the year by 
lower cattle prices. This was partially 
mitigated by a gradual recovery in the 
second half which has continued into 
the new financial year. In October 2017 
we completed the acquisition of Pearson 
Farm Supplies Ltd in line with our 
strategy of strengthening our presence 
in current locations.
With the backdrop of this recovering 
USA trading environment, the strategic 
investment made in our new low 
moisture feed block plant in Tennessee, 
USA will provide us with access to new 
geographic markets in the Eastern  
and South Eastern states of the USA.  
The plant is expected to be completed 
before the end of December 2017  
and following this the Group will have 
comprehensive coverage of all the major 
cattle areas in the USA. 
In our Engineering division, we suffered 
a significant setback during the year as  
a result of a delay to the commencement 
of a major contract and the poor 
profitability of certain other contracts 
during the period. As previously disclosed 
in our trading update on 20 July 2017, 
the delayed contract has now been 
signed and work has begun which will 
continue throughout the current and  
into the next financial year. 
During the year we also invested  
in the acquisition of two engineering 
businesses. In October 2016 we acquired 
a German family-owned engineering 
business, STABER GmbH, which designs 
and develops specialised technology 
and is highly complementary to 
Wälischmiller, our German remote 
handling business. Since its acquisition, 
STABER has been integrated with 
Wälischmiller and we are investing in the 
extension of our premises in Markdorf, 
Germany to consolidate both operations 
into one site and provide additional 
efficiency, flexibility and capacity. 
In August 2017 we announced the 
acquisition of NuVision Engineering, Inc., 
a world renowned technology and 
engineering company based in the USA, 
specialising in the supply of products 
and services to the nuclear industry.  
The acquisition will provide the Group 
with a foothold into new major nuclear 
markets and the opportunity to market 
Wälischmiller products in the USA.  
In addition, we have continued to invest 
in extending our reach into new markets, 
particularly China, where significant 
opportunities lie in the supply chain  
as part of the country’s increased 
development and investment in the 
nuclear power market.
We have also increased the strength  
and depth of our management team  
in the Engineering division through the 
appointment of a Divisional Managing 
Director who will oversee and coordinate 
the businesses in the UK, Germany and 
the USA.
In total, the Group has invested up  
to £24.3 million in expanding its USA 
feed block operations and in growing 
the Engineering division through 
acquisitions which take the Group  
into new geographic markets, provide 
additional capabilities, and support  
our growth ambitions. We therefore 
remain confident in the future prospects 
of both divisions. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Revenue for the year increased by 9.9% 
to £346.2 million (2016: £314.9 million). 
Operating profit before amortisation  
of intangible assets and non-recurring 
items was down 28.5% to £9.3 million 
(2016: £13.0 million), with Agriculture 
contributing £8.6 million (2016: £10.4 
million) and Engineering £0.7 million 
(2016: £2.6 million). The contribution 
from associates and joint ventures was up 
35.2% at £2.8 million (2016: £2.1 million).
The Group incurred a number of non-
recurring items in the year, totalling  
£1.3 million. This included acquisition 
costs of £1.4 million, primarily related  
to the acquisitions of NuVision and 
STABER, and a net credit relating to 
Chirton Engineering of £0.4 million.  
The net credit comprised an exceptional 
credit of £2.1 million for contingent 
consideration no longer payable and  
an impairment charge against the 
associated goodwill of £1.7 million.  
There was also a loss of £0.2 million  
on the disposal of an old, unutilised 
Agriculture site and restructuring costs 
of £0.1 million. 
Reported operating profit after 
amortisation of intangible assets and 
non-recurring items was down 38.3%  
at £7.9 million (2016: £12.8 million).
Despite challenges  
in both of our divisions, 
the year was one of 
investment and significant 
progress towards 
achieving the Group’s 
medium term  
strategic objectives. Carr’s Group plc

DIVIDEND
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 2.1 pence per ordinary share, which 
together with the two interim dividends 
of 0.95 pence per ordinary share paid on 
12 May 2017 and 6 October 2017, make  
a total of 4.0 pence per share for the year 
(2016: 3.8 pence per share) excluding the 
special dividend of 17.54 pence per share 
paid in October 2016. The final dividend, 
if approved by the shareholders, will be 
paid on 12 January 2018, to shareholders 
on the register on close of business  
15 December 2017, and the shares will  
go ex-dividend on 14 December 2017.
BOARD COMPOSITION AND 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In line with our commitment to continual 
improvements in corporate governance, 
during the year we engaged 
Independent Audit Limited, a leading 
specialist in corporate governance,  
to conduct an external evaluation  
of the effectiveness of the Board and  
its Committees. That review concluded 
that the Board and its Committees  
were functioning well and noted that 
improvements had been made since  
the previous external review which  
we carried out in 2013. It also made  
a number of further recommendations 
which the Board has already begun  
to work towards implementing.  
The Board remains firmly committed  
to good governance. 
Some changes have been made this  
year to the composition of the Board’s 
Committees and to the Group’s 
Remuneration Policy in light of feedback 
received from shareholders and investor 
reporting bodies following our 2016 
Annual Report. We always welcome  
the views of all Carr’s Group plc 
stakeholders, particularly where  
it can lead to improvements in our  
governance framework. 
Full details of our approach to Corporate 
Governance, the independent review 
undertaken during 2017 and our policy 
on continued improvement are set  
out on pages 26-29 of our Annual Report 
and Accounts.
OUTLOOK
The Group remains focused on 
delivering its stated strategic objectives 
of investing in both its people and its 
asset base whilst continuing to drive 
product innovation and deliver growth, 
both organically and by acquisition, 
across our two divisions. 
The outlook for UK Agriculture remains 
positive with farm incomes continuing 
to improve in the near term. Additionally, 
we continue to see a gradual 
improvement in cattle prices in the USA, 
resulting in improved feed block 
volumes, which is expected to continue. 
In Engineering, the difficulties in our UK 
business largely caused by a significant 
contract delay have been addressed and, 
with the beneficial effects of other 
contract wins and strengthened 
management, we expect to see  
a significant improvement in the year 
ahead. The recent acquisitions enhance 
the depth of our offering and provide 
further opportunities to drive growth. 
We are also encouraged by the 
opportunities apparent within our 
Engineering division, particularly  
in China and the USA.
Looking further ahead, it remains unclear 
what the UK’s terms of exit from the 
European Union will look like. However, 
the Board will continue to monitor  
the position closely and the Group will 
remain flexible to respond to any 
challenges that may arise. 
Overall, trading in the new financial year 
has started well and in line with the 
Board’s expectations, with a particularly 
good start to the year in our USA  
feed block business and strong order 
books across the Engineering division.  
We believe, that with the investments 
made in acquisitions and research  
during the year in both Agriculture  
and Engineering, we have laid a solid 
foundation for sustained growth and are 
confident in the outlook for the Group.
