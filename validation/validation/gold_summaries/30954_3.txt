A sustainable model  
in growing markets
Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to introduce Just Group plc’s 
2017 Annual Report. The Company has once 
again produced a strong set of results.
The Group has a robust strategy, a strong 
management team and we enjoy a 
competitive advantage based on our 
hard-to-replicate intellectual property. We 
are focused on some of the most attractive 
growing markets in the retirement sector 
and we are confident this growth will 
continue, given the strong structural drivers 
supporting it.
Just has a strong social purpose and by 
providing people with advice, guidance, 
products and services, we help them achieve 
security, certainty and peace of mind in later 
life. We believe everyone deserves a fair, 
fulfilling and secure retirement.
This is possible because our Board is focused 
on building a sustainable business and using 
our capital wisely. This focus ensures we are 
always able to keep the promises that we 
have made to our customers.
Profit growth continues
Participating in economically attractive 
growing markets enables us to be selective in 
the risks we choose to write and this has 
enabled us to improve our margins and grow 
profits, rather than pursue headline sales 
growth in search of market share.
I am delighted that we have been able to 
exceed the synergy benefits we targeted 
from the merger and deliver them one year 
ahead of plan. The cost efficiency achieved 
from the merger has contributed significantly 
to improved margins, as explained in more 
detail in the Financial Review.
Dividend
Despite the challenging external 
environment, Just has delivered another 
strong operating and financial performance, 
driven in particular by our focus on disciplined 
pricing and risk selection. The Board proposes 
a final dividend of 2.55 pence per share, a  05

calendar year: 3.5 pence per share). This is a 
6% increase and reflects the Board’s 
confidence in the Group’s prospects.
Board composition and governance
I take great pride in leading the Board and 
the Group’s governance function, and I am 
pleased to confirm we have benefited from 
continuity of membership since the AGM in 
2017. Shortly before the AGM we announced 
that James Fraser and Peter Catterall wished 
to step down as Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company and I would like to thank them 
for their significant contribution to the Group 
over many years.
My introduction to the Corporate Governance 
Report provides further information on our 
robust governance and decision making 
processes. I would like to thank the entire 
Board for their significant contribution, 
commitment and service; and look forward to 
working with them in 2018 as the Group 
continues to build on its strategic priorities.
Shareholders and other stakeholders
By serving our customers well we aim to 
generate strong returns for our shareholders, 
provide rewarding roles for our colleagues 
and support for communities. The Board 
engages with our regulators, legislators and 
wider society to promote the interests of our 
customers more broadly and we place great 
importance on working effectively with these 
groups.
We had an active programme of engagement 
with shareholders and the investment 
community in 2017; we listened to their views 
and provided detailed insight into our 
markets, how we win new business and the 
considerable growth opportunities we see for 
our Group. 
A confident future
The outlook remains favourable for each of 
our key businesses. I am excited about the 
prospects for growth in our markets and the 
opportunities for Just Group plc. Our results in 
this period demonstrate our ability to deliver 
increasing profits, and we look forward to 
delivering further growth and value for our 
shareholders.
On behalf of the Board I would like to close by 
thanking all of our colleagues across the 
Group in the UK, South Africa and the United 
States for their hard work, ingenuity and 
commitment to our mission. Their positive 
energy and dedication in supporting our 
customers and business partners has helped 
our business progress in 2017, and has 
ensured we are well placed for the future.
