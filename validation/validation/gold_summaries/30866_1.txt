 14 STRATEGIC REPORT
KEY FINANCIAL 
HIGHLIGHTS
JLT made substantial financial 
progress in 2017, returning to strong 
organic revenue growth. 
JLT achieved total revenues of 
£1,386 million in 2017, an increase of 
10% over 2016. This included strong 
organic revenue growth of 5%, in line 
with historical rates. 
Our underlying profit before tax  
increased by 11% to £191.5 million,  
or by 8% at constant rates of  
exchange (CRE). The trading margin  
was maintained at 15.4%.
RISK & INSURANCE
Our global Risk & Insurance businesses 
grew revenues to £1,066 million, 
an increase of 11%, with organic 
revenue growth of 5%. Trading profit 
rose substantially, increasing from 
£166.6 million to £197.9 million and 
contributing to a 2% increase in trading 
margin to 19%. 
JLT Europe delivered total revenues of 
£399.3 million in 2017. After adjusting  
for the disposal of Thistle at the end of 
2016, this represented revenue growth  
of 7%, or 4% growth on an organic 
revenue basis. Trading profit in JLT 
Europe increased by 9% to £90.6 million 
and the trading margin increased from 
22% to 23% on an adjusted basis. 
Strong client retention and new 
business drove good performances 
from most divisions, including in 
Financial Lines, Northern Europe and 
Credit & Political Risks. This achievement 
was delivered despite challenging market 
conditions, particularly in the Energy 
and Marine sectors. 
We made investments in 2017 to 
strengthen our presence in continental 
Europe, including the acquisition of 
Belgibo, the Belgian specialty broker, 
in August. These investments for growth 
also support our Brexit planning, enabling 
JLT to manage the consequences of 
different Brexit scenarios. 
Outside of Europe, we also delivered 
strong growth in our international 
Specialty businesses, which achieved 
revenues of £449.4 million, a headline 
increase of 21% with organic revenue 
growth of 8%. The combined trading 
margin in the international Specialty 
businesses increased from 12% to 14%.
JLT's Australia and New Zealand 
businesses grew revenues by 7% 
to £125.7 million. We anticipate that 
earnings from a number of important 
client wins will help these businesses 
return to organic revenue growth in 2018.
Our business in Asia had a good 
performance with an 11% increase in 
revenues to £100.3 million, with 6% 
organic revenue growth. Revenue 
performance was driven by our core 
specialties, particularly Financial Lines 
and Construction.
Our Latin American operations grew 
revenues by 31% to £93.3 million, 
with 19% organic revenue growth. 
Trading profit increased by 24% to 
£26.1 million, a 17% increase at CRE. 
We have been making significant 
investments in building our Specialty 
capabilities across Latin America and 
these results demonstrate the success 
of that strategy.
The US Specialty business continued 
to make good progress in the year, 
delivering revenue approaching           
USD 100 million. Net investment losses 
reduced from £27 million to £16 million, 
delivering on our previous guidance  
that these losses reached the 'high-
water' mark at the end of 2016.  
The US business is now firmly  
established with 335 employees in  
17 locations and an increasing market 
presence, now representing 5% of the 
Fortune 500.

in the growth of JLT.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
JLT Re, our global reinsurance broking business, increased 
revenues by 11% to £217.1 million, reflecting organic revenue 
growth of 4%. This performance was delivered despite a 
continued decline in pricing across most lines of reinsurance 
and in most geographies during the year. This was underlined 
by the 1 January 2017 renewals, which saw risk-adjusted global 
property-catastrophe pricing reduce by almost 6%.  
JLT Re’s trading profit increased by 5% to £42.4 million.  
The trading margin was 20% in the year, reflecting JLT Re’s 
continued investment in market leading talent across all of its 
geographies, increasing headcount by approximately 10% 
year on year. Organic revenue growth in Europe and North 
America was offset in part by Asia Pacific, where we saw 
significant headwinds from the rating environment combined 
with reductions in facultative buying activity.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
JLT's global Employee Benefits (EB) operations delivered 
overall revenue growth of 7%, with 4% organic revenue growth. 
Within the global total, the UK EB business achieved particularly 
strong organic revenue growth of 8%, which was offset by 
some weakness in regions of the international EB business. 
JLT’s UK and Ireland EB business grew revenues by 7% to 
£172.0 million, reflecting impressive organic revenue growth 
of 8%. Trading profit increased by 40% to £17.2 million.  
Trading margins in the UK and Ireland EB business increased 
from 8% to 10%. We now expect to achieve our 15% trading 
margin target for this business in 2019, rather than in 2018, 
with the benefit of the Global Transformation Programme 
described below. The Group anticipates that the business will 
make further progress in 2018 towards this target, with the 
majority of the progress being made in 2019.
JLT's international Employee Benefits businesses achieved 
mixed headline results, although there was improving 
momentum and some good performances within  
individual businesses.
In Asia, Private Client Services (PCS), our life assurance 
broker, had a difficult first half to the year. However, this was 
followed by a positive performance in the second half of the 
year. The business is now expanding into new geographies, 
including mainland China.
In Australia, structural changes in the workers compensation 
market resulted in a slower rate of revenue growth. However, 
we are anticipating a better performance in 2018, building on 
the trading profit growth in 2017.
In Brazil, corporate payrolls fell as the economy remained 
weak, leading to slower headline revenue growth and a 
year on year reduction in trading profit in the region. 
However, Latin America EB has been successful in winning 
significant volumes of new business and we look forward to 
growth rates returning to former levels in this business as 
economies in the region recover.
Details of the performance of each individual business are set 
out in the Review of Operations on pages 27 to 34. 
A YEAR OF PROGRESS AND 
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT
2017 was an important year for the JLT Group. The decisions 
we took during the year and the strategic developments we 
have initiated will, I believe, mark the start of a new chapter in 
the growth of JLT.
The Group’s acquisition of TW Re in late 2013, followed by the 
establishment of JLT’s US Specialty business in 2014, has given 
JLT a firm foundation in the US. That increase in scope and 
opportunity provided the context for the Group's re-examination 
of its strategy during 2017. The process confirmed that:
• JLT’s deep specialist strength is a key differentiator between 
JLT and its larger competitors; and
• representation in the US now gives JLT the opportunity to 
move from an international to a global business across each 
of Reinsurance, Specialty and Employee Benefits.
JLT re-articulated its mission, ‘To become the leading global 
specialist risk adviser and broker', and the Group is now taking 
a number of important steps towards its strategic objectives.
BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
We are making a number of structural changes to the 
businesses and management of JLT. Collaboration has 
always been a key part of the JLT culture. However, 
becoming truly global requires us to graduate from informal, 
ad hoc collaboration to consistent and systematically 
coordinated working. 
As announced in January 2018, Lucy Clarke has been 
appointed to the new role of Global CEO of the Group's 
Specialty business with effect from 1 April. Bringing JLT's 
regional insurance broking operations together into an 
integrated Specialty division, with leaders appointed in each 
of its principal industry specialty businesses (Energy, 
Construction, Financial Lines, Aerospace, Marine & Cargo 
and Credit & Political Risks), responsible for globally coordinated 
sales and delivery to clients, will enable JLT to operate as 
a combined group of global specialists. 16 STRATEGIC REPORT
An integrated global management structure is already operating 
effectively and delivering value in JLT’s Reinsurance division. 
The Group is confident that JLT will realise the same benefits 
in Global Specialty, and that its Specialty businesses will see 
accelerated growth, operating on a global basis.
Employee Benefits will also operate as a worldwide business. 
UK & Ireland and International Employee Benefits, including 
PCS, will be the third of JLT's three business divisions. 
From 1 April 2018, the Group’s businesses will therefore be 
structured into three divisions, Reinsurance, Specialty and 
Employee Benefits, and the same structure will be adopted 
when reporting the Group’s future results.
GLOBAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME – 
TRANSFORMING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES
For some time JLT has been investigating how we can 
streamline the operational processes used to serve clients in 
each of our divisions, to deliver global consistency and eliminate 
duplicated costs. 
The Group will be implementing a two-year plus Group-wide 
Global Transformation Programme. From 2020, JLT expects 
to use a consistent set of processes and core operating 
platforms for the delivery of each of Reinsurance, Specialty 
and Employee Benefits. 
The benefits will be significant in terms of seamless global 
service and delivery; communications internally and externally 
to clients; and data collection and analysis. 
In financial terms, the Group expects the programme to deliver 
annualised savings of £40 million by 2020 for a one-off cost 
of £45 million. Further financial details can be found in the 
Finance Director’s Review on page 38.
Operating on a consistent basis across all of JLT’s global 
businesses will achieve significant, tangible benefits: 
a better client experience, improved cost efficiency and 
stronger controls.
JLT SPECIALTY USA – BUILDING A BUSINESS  
OF SCALE
The objective of building a US Specialty business that 
contributes to the Group on a scale that better reflects the 
importance of the US to the global economy is at the heart 
of the Group’s medium term strategy.
In addition to revenues and profits generated in and from the 
US, the Group believes that a strong US business will create 
further opportunities for growth in other parts of the world. 
We therefore intend to build on the firm foundation that JLT 
has already established in the US through continuing organic 
revenue growth, complemented by targeted acquisitions. 
This began with the purchase of a controlling interest in the 
construction specialist, Construction Risk Partners, in January 
2017 which has proven to be highly successful, delivering a 
continuing stream of domestic wins and increasing coordination 
throughout the Group to win and service international 
construction clients. 
In 2017, the US Specialty business represented 5% of the 
Group’s revenues. That proportion is expected to grow in the 
next few years. Following a move into profitability in 2019, 
we anticipate that trading margins in the US Specialty business 
will move broadly into line with those in JLT’s other major global 
Specialty businesses in the medium term. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS - ESTABLISHING A 
COORDINATED GLOBAL BUSINESS
The Group is confident about the momentum throughout 
the Employee Benefits busnesses going into 2018, and the 
prospects for the division’s revenue and profit growth.
In UK EB, the largest business, we anticipate further strong 
growth in both revenue and trading margin as we see a return 
on the investments made in recent years. 
The UK EB business has a strong position in the occupational 
pension scheme market. It is also making appropriate 
investments for the future so as to generate new business from 
today’s employees. These investments are in the ‘new world’ 
areas of retirement savings, occupational health insurance, 
employee wellness, workplace marketing and flexible benefits 
made available by employers to their workforces, as well as 
serving the growing needs of workers in the ‘gig economy'.
JLT now operates Employee Benefits across the Group and 
through its international network, and we have begun work to 
coordinate the presentation and marketing of our Employee 
Benefits activities worldwide. During 2017, we took advantage 
of JLT's international coverage to launch a coordinated global 
Employee Benefits offering, sold, managed and delivered by a 
single global team. The initial response from clients confirms 
that JLT can grow revenues in the international employee 
benefits market.     Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 17
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
LOOKING FORWARD 
After five consecutive years of falling reinsurance rates, global 
property catastrophe rates have experienced some upward 
pressure but with significant variances across regions driven 
in large part by the losses experienced following hurricanes 
Harvey, Irma and Maria. Across most lines and most classes of 
reinsurance and specialty, the trend of steady price reductions 
through a number of years seems to have moderated or ended. 
However, a consistent pattern is not evident and it would be 
premature to refer to a hardening market. 
In today’s market each risk needs the broker to demonstrate 
real understanding of the risk and real transactional expertise to 
secure appropriate cover on the optimum terms for the client. 
This is the specialist capability that JLT has built over the past 
decade and the Group is confident that JLT is well placed to 
grow and execute on its strategy.
JLT has entered 2018 with real momentum but we do not 
expect a consistently hard insurance market. While the Group 
is positive with regards to the factors within its control, volatile 
currency markets present a risk. Therefore, taken together, 
JLT enters 2018 looking forward to continuing strong organic 
revenue growth and further financial progress.
