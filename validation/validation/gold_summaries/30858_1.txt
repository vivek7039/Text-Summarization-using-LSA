Chief Executive's report
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 In 2017, the Group has continued to build on the strong 
foundations built in 2016 and has driven a significant and 
sustainable improvement in profitability. 
Revenues fell in 2017 to £84.9m (2016: £90.3m); however, 
2016 revenue included £11.6m relating to the Ofsted contract 
which successfully concluded in March 2017 (2017 Ofsted 
revenue: £3.0m), and £1.7m from Synergy (disposed of in March 
2016) and SLS (closed 2015). Excluding these items, revenue 
relating to continuing operations increased by 6.5%, to £81.9m 
(2016: £76.9m). 
Annually Recurring Revenues, which from 2017 include cloud 
services, increased by 5.5% to £37.5m (2016: £35.5m).
We identified areas where we can more effectively align the 
Group’s resources to deliver material cost efficiencies and 
improve margin without impacting the Group’s ability to serve our 
customers or drive our business forward. Cumulative annualised 
cost savings achieved since the start of the cost efficiencies 
programme total £12.0m, of which £3.0 annualised savings were 
realised in 2017 (2016: £9.0m annualised, of which £5.8m in year). 
The impact of these actions has grown through the year, and 
we can report a significantly improved trading performance for 
2017, with the first full year statutory profit since 2013, and 
adjusted operating profit up 82% to £8.5m (2016: £4.7m). This, 
coupled with good cash generation, with net cash up 59% to 
£14.1m (2016: £8.8m), has left the Group in a stronger position 
at the end of the financial year.
2017 in summary
In our chosen regional markets and sectors, overall activity 
levels for the replacement or enhancement of student 
management systems have remained stable; we have seen 
significantly improved win rates in our UK Further Education 
and Work-based Learning businesses and we continue to win 
new customers in the Higher Education sector, reaffirming 
the strength of Tribal’s software and services portfolio, and 
confirming that our international customer base and continued 
market leading position provide a strong platform around which 
to build long-term shareholder value.
The Group won significant new contracts in the Higher Education 
sector, including at the University of Sheffield, a major UK 
Russell Group University, as well as contracts with Glasgow 
Caledonian University, University of South Wales and Heriot-
Watt University. We also secured our third Higher Education 
customer in Malaysia at the University of Malaya.
Our Callista business, which provides student information 
systems to 25% of Australian universities, performed well, and 
we finalised a AUD$27.5m (approx. £16.8m), four-year extension 
to our contract with the 11 Universities for the on-going 
development of the Callista product with seamless migration 
into the cloud-ready Tribal Edge product platform.
Quality Assurance Solutions (QAS) confirmed its position as a 
market-leading international school inspections business. QAS 
completed the first term as sole provider of school inspections 
for the Department of Education and Knowledge in Abu Dhabi. 
In Dubai, a contract with the Ministry of Education (MoE) for the 
review of public schools was won and delivered. In 2018, the MoE 
in Dubai also awarded us the contract for the review of private 
schools. In the US, evaluations of schools and districts in New 
York State continued under a new contract extension and similar 
review work was won with a new state, Alabama. The contract 
to provide the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of 
Mathematics for the UK Department for Education was expanded 
to include additional maths development in the North of England. 
The Group's large customer base ensures it is well positioned 
to take advantage of the increasing market trend to improve 
student engagement, through our experience in data analytics 
and student barometers from the i-graduate line of business. 
Shareholder returns & dividends
Given recent performance of the business, a strengthened 
balance sheet and confidence in the sustained profitability of 
the business, the Board has declared a full year dividend of 1p 
which will be paid in May 2018, pending approval at the AGM in 
April 2018. The Board of Directors believes that the payment of 
dividends is important, and will continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy.

 17 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
1 Student Information System (SIS) is the general industry term for education management solutions that encompasses Management Information Systems 
(MIS), Customer (or Student) Relationship Management (CRM), business insight and data analytics products. Student Management System (SMS) is more 
specifically the administration aspect of Student Information Systems. We refer to our heritage products as SMS, our new offerings (aligned with their wider 
applicability) as SIS, and the general industry as student information. Chief Executive's report continued
Product & Services Strategy
Tribal is a worldwide, software and services company focussed 
on the education market. At the core of our business, we have 
a portfolio of functionally rich student information systems 
and these are being expanded with the development of a next 
generation, cloud-based solution – Tribal Edge. Our new product 
investment will focus on Tribal Edge and delivering a solution 
that enables institutions to significantly enhance the student 
experience they are able to offer. 
The Group also continues to invest significantly in our existing 
products; in 2017 , the Group spent £10.2m (2016: £10.3m) 
on product development, of which £2.1m (2016: £1.1m) was 
capitalised, and related to development of SchoolEdge and the 
new Tribal Edge solution. The remaining £8.1m (2016: £9.2m) was 
expensed in year and related to product development costs and 
related overheads for the existing SITS, ebs, and Maytas products.
Tribal Edge was successfully launched at our UK Higher Education 
conference in July. The launch was followed by a series of 
roadshows to all our UK customers. This has drawn high interest and 
secured commitments for beta sites and early adopters for the first 
Tribal Edge modules. The launch to our Asia Pacific customers has 
been equally well received, with those using Callista having agreed 
a four-year contract extension that includes the integration of Tribal 
Edge for their use in the near-term. 
Our strategy for Tribal Edge has been to first develop a number of 
new modules that deliver additional functionality for our Higher 
and Further Education customers and that integrate to all our 
core student information systems. The initial modules are:
• Student View – a mobile app giving students anytime, 
anywhere availability to see their day at a glance and enabling 
them to access all information they need at their fingertips, 
all personalised to their timetable and their lifestyle. Student 
View incorporates Student Engage. 
• Student Engage – a social collaboration app designed to 
operate like a social network but with added safeguarding 
features that keep staff’s professional and personal 
lives separate. It enables staff and students to connect, 
communicate and collaborate with each other safely  
and securely. 
• Student Support – ensures students are supported through 
the complete education lifecycle. Institution support staff 
have a single view of all student performance issues and 
identify opportunities to deliver critical support to reduce 
drop-outs and maximise student successes, while students 
have easy access to support wherever they are. 
• Student Insight – a learning analytics solution that monitors 
and tracks student engagement, analysing student data from 
multiple sources, and flagging students at potential risk, thus 
enabling the targeting of students that need support. This 
timely intervention improves outcomes and reduces dropouts. 
The Student Engage module was kick-started with the 
acquisition of intellectual property and exclusive distribution 
rights for an existing private social network solution in the 
education markets across the UK, Australia and New Zealand. 
This gave both an existing customer base and a solution that 
was actively used and could be developed upon, and is now 
available as Student Engage, fully integrated into a single mobile 
app, Student View. 
A closed-beta (limited access) was completed at the end of 
2017 and a full beta programme is now underway with both 
Higher Education and Further Education customers in the UK and 
in Australia. Several early adopters have also been identified and 
they will receive the roll-out of new modules in early 2018. The 
Student Insight module was also used as the enabling platform 
in the ongoing trial of student analytics and analysis with JISC. 
Our progress with Tribal Edge has been further enhanced 
with a strategic partnership with Microsoft. Microsoft’s 
Azure application development team will work with Tribal to 
accelerate the creation of new functionality, enabling the 
rapid development of an enhanced cloud-based platform and 
the conversion of the current functionally-rich applications of 
SITS:Vision and ebs to the Tribal Edge framework. 
Outside of Higher and Further Education, we have continued 
the successful development of SchoolEdge, a new, web-
based product for schools. Schools in Australia have adopted 
many of the new modules on offer and the development 
continues to offer a completely refreshed schools student 
information system. 
We have also continued to invest in our market-leading 
employers and training providers solution, Maytas. This has seen 
particular growth in the UK where the Government’s introduction 
of the Apprenticeship Levy has encouraged companies to 
explore and adopt apprentices. Maytas fully supports the 
management of apprenticeship programmes including the 
critical area of funding. 
Business Structure
“Oxford chose to work with T ribal 
because its SITS product is the 
market leader, and there is a very 
strong user base and an active user 
group. We have found T ribal to be a 
high quality and responsive company 
to work with, with very good customer 
engagement from consultancy staff 
right up to Board level.”

Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 Tribal’s organisational structure has been simplified to 
drive improved customer focus, more agile management, 
responsiveness to local needs and clear accountability across 
our business and is managed through three segments. 
Within the Student Management Systems business, we have 
adopted a primarily regional structure, split between Europe, 
Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Australia, New Zealand and 
Asia-Pacific (APAC). QAS and i-graduate operate as independent 
businesses and are managed globally. 
Student Management Systems (SMS) focusses on the following 
market sectors: Higher Education, Further Education, Colleges 
and Employers (referred to in Australia as VET), and Schools, and 
across three main markets, UK, Australia and New Zealand. Product/
Offerings are split between License & Development Services, 
Support & Maintenance, Implementation, and Cloud Operations; 
from 2017 , SMS no longer includes K2 Asset Management (K2) or 
Software Solutions, as they are non-core businesses and are now 
included within the i-graduate line of business. 
Quality Assurance Solutions covers inspection and review 
services which support the assessment of educational delivery 
including the Ofsted Early Years inspection contract. From 2017, 
it also includes Performance Benchmarking. 
i-graduate covers i-graduate student surveys and data 
analytics as well as various non-core businesses, not forming 
part of Student Management Systems or QAS. These include 
K2 Asset Management, Software Solutions and Information 
Matters. It no longer includes Performance Benchmarking, which 
has moved to QAS in 2017.
Revenue and profit for each segment are restated for 2016 to 
reflect the above changes.
Product & Services revenues
The table below groups products and offerings, irrespective of 
the segment in which they fall. Most license and related services 
(Support & Maintenance, Implementation Services and Cloud 
Services) relate to the Group’s Student Management Systems; 
however, there are businesses which are non-core, managed 
under the i-graduate line of business, which include license and 
related services. This includes K2 and Software Solutions where 
we continue to support and maintain the existing product; the 
Group also has a software product, developed and sold by QAS, 
to support Ofsted as they manage school inspections following 
the conclusion of our Ofsted contract at the end of March 2017. 
All revenue (which includes license, support & maintenance, 
and other services) relating to Synergy (disposed of) and SLS 
(closed) is shown separately.

 19 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction Chief Executive's report continued
Overall, the revenue from License & Development fees has 
fallen 9.0% to £10.0m (2016: £11.0m). This is due in part to 
contracts successfully moving from a software development 
phase further into the implementation phase. We have also seen 
some Higher Education institutions moving towards a bundled 
pricing model, where the contractual terms result in license 
revenue being phased over time rather than being recognised 
upfront, as previously. In 2017, the contract awarded by Glasgow 
Caledonian University was based on a bundled pricing model 
with contractual terms that resulted in the software license 
recognition being phased over the implementation period. 
For 2018, this transition ends with the move to IFRS15 accounting, 
by which the Group’s revised revenue recognition policy requires all 
significant license revenue to be spread over the implementation 
period (as detailed in the Financial Review section). 
Support & Maintenance retention rates remain high, and as a 
result, our Annual Recurring Revenue base has continued to 
grow. Support & Maintenance fees in the period were £33.5m 
(2016: £32.2m), an increase of 3.9%.
Implementation services deliver the technical implementation 
of our software products at customer sites, typically working 
alongside customer teams. Implementation projects vary in 
length, and range from a small number of days, to more than two 
years for more complex projects. Revenues are typically based 
on day rate fees, although we sometimes operate under fixed fee 
contracts for defined implementation scopes. Overall growth of 
19.6% was driven by the extensive implementation work at British 
Council, University of Waikato and Massey University.
Cloud services cover the provision of managed IT services and 
hosting services to customers to manage their Tribal products 
either on premise, in a private cloud, or in a public cloud. These 
services have grown by 20.5% in 2017, to £4.0m (2016: £3.3m) 
as customers increasingly migrate their IT systems into the 
cloud. These hosting services are recurring, and from 2017 the 
Group will include Cloud services revenue in the calculation of 
Annually Recurring Revenue.
School inspections & related services covers all products and 
services offered by the QAS line of business which do not relate 
to the sale of software licenses and related services.
Surveys & data analytics covers all products and services 
offered by the i-graduate line of business which do not relate  
to the sale of software licenses and related services.

equivalent headcount (FTE) has reduced by 221 FTEs in the year.
This follows an 18% headcount reduction in the previous year, a 
total reduction of 473 heads (36%) since 31 December 2015. 
Of these reductions in 2017, approximately 100 FTE reductions 
were the result of specific actions taken as part of our cost 
reduction program to drive increased profitability. The other 
reductions were due to the winding down of the Ofsted contract, 
and were transferred back to Ofsted under TUPE regulations.

Student Management Systems
Overall activity levels in our markets and sectors for the 
replacement or enhancement of student information systems 
remain stable and we continue to see a steady stream of new 
opportunities in all sectors. 
In 2016, the Student Management System included combined 
revenue of £1.7m and profits of £1.0m, from Synergy (disposed 
of in March 2016) and SLS (closed in 2015). 
Student Management Systems revenues increased by 1.7% to 
£60.0m (2016: £59.0m). Excluding Synergy/SLS, SMS revenue 
grew by 4.8%.
Adjusted operating profit was £17.6m (2016: £12.0m) and the 
adjusted operating margin was 29% (2016: 20%). Excluding 
Synergy/SLS, SMS profit grew by 60%.
The capitalised development cost was £2.1m in 2017 
(2016: £1.1m). This relates to continued development of our 
SchoolEdge product and investment in our Tribal Edge next 
generation, cloud-based student management system.

a major UK Russell Group University, as well as contracts 
with Glasgow Caledonian University, the University of South 
Wales and Heriot-Watt University. We secured our third Higher 
Education customer in Malaysia, at the University of Malaya, 
reaffirming Tribal as an international market leader in student 
information systems. 
“We were really impressed with the 
level of integration and efficiency 
the combination of Maytas and 
e-track could bring to our learner 
management. The Tribal team 
suggested the best combination of 
systems and tools to address our 
specific business needs.”

Within the Higher Education sector, our Callista business, 
which was acquired in March 2015, and which provides student 
information systems to 25% of Australian universities, 
performed well, and we finalised a AUD27.5m (approx. £16.8m), 
four-year extension to our contract with the 11 Universities for 
the on-going development of the Callista product and seamless 
migration into the cloud-ready Tribal Edge platform.
We have successfully completed key implementation stages at 
Massey University and the University of Waikato in New Zealand, 
as well as commencing the implementation of recent wins at 
the University of the Arts London, the University of Malaya, 
and Sheffield University. Other key implementation contracts 
continue to proceed well, if slightly delayed, including Universiti 
Teknologi Petronas (UTP) and Institut Teknologi Petroleum 
Petronas (INSTEP) in Malaysia, and University of Bristol.
In the EMEA Further Education and Work-based Learning 
(WBL) business, we continued to make strong progress in 
2017, with key wins at Nottingham College, Bridgend College 
and the Met Film School, and, following the introduction of the 
apprenticeship levy, secured new WBL Maytas customers, 
including Travis Perkins, Boots Opticians and EY (Ernst & Young).
In the APAC Further Education (referred to as VET in Australia/
New Zealand) and Schools sectors, the New South Wales 
Student Administration and Learning Management (SALM) 
programme has continued to deploy our ebs Student 
Management System successfully; in 2017, we successfully 
concluded the roll-out to 2,200 schools in New South Wales 
(NSW). This is in addition to the 138 TAFE (Technical & Further 
Education) campuses, which continue to operate successfully 
– although, as previously noted, the NSW Government made a 
public announcement in June 2016 that they will be reviewing 
their TAFE student enrolment system and will look to implement 
a new, cloud-based solution. Tribal continues to discuss the 
future solution with TAFE NSW but, regardless, we expect TAFE 
NSW to be a customer into 2019, and the schools’ element of 
SALM will continue as planned.
Within our Campus business, the implementation at the British 
Council continues to proceed well, and we have now gone live in 
119 locations in 34 countries worldwide.
Our other Student Information product for schools, SchoolEdge, 
has enjoyed good customer retention rates during the 
year. However, we have been informed that the dioceses 
representing around 800 of the 1800 schools have decided 
to move from Tribal to a student information system that 
they are building in collaboration with two providers; we have 
commenced discussions regarding transitional arrangement; 
however, we expect to continue to provide software and 
services to these schools into at least 2019.

The i-graduate division provides a range of services for 
managers of universities, colleges and schools, so they are able 
to assess and enhance the quality of the education they provide 
and improve their operational performance. Also included in 
this line of business are non-core services. Products/Offerings 
provided by this division include:
•  i-graduate student surveys & data analytics
•  K2 Asset Management
•  Software Solutions
•  Transformation and change advisory services
•  Information Management Services
This division’s activities have increasingly focused on those 
skills and tools that closely relate to our student information 
systems. Increasingly, we integrate these activities with our 
software offerings.
“We’ve used Tribal software to 
improve the experience for our 
applicants. The University absolutely 
pushes experience far more than 
it does the nuts and bolts of 
administration, which really  
should be as invisible, but as  
robust as possible.”
The University of St Andrews 
UK
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 22 i-graduate line of business revenue in the period was £7.1m 
(2016: £8.7m), a reduction of 18%. 
Revenue from the core i-graduate student survey and data 
analytics offerings fell 3.7% from £3.1m to £3.0m. In our 
i-graduate business there was a change of leadership in the 
first half of the year, and we successfully secured contracts in 
Australia, including for the Australian Universities International 
Student Barometer. We also extended the strategic partnership 
with Universities UK International, delivering underpinning 
research for the widely distributed UK's Competitive Advantage 
report. However, the overall participation by universities in 
the key International Student Barometer survey towards the 
end of 2017 was disappointing, as more universities than 
expected chose to skip a year. There were also costs of further 
investment in the business and management transition. These 
factors adversely impacted the segmental operating profit, 
which fell to £0.4m (2016: £1.1m).
The revenue from the non-core businesses fell by £1.5m, 
including £0.8m in K2 Asset Management and £0.4m in 
Information Matters as the businesses are transitioned to a 
maintenance mode. However, the focus on optimising margins 
improved the operating profit to £0.7m (2016: £(0.1)m).

QAS provides inspection services used by the Office of 
Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted), 
the UK government agency responsible for monitoring quality in 
settings such as colleges, schools and nurseries. These services 
have also been purchased by government agencies in the US 
and Middle East. Typically, we provide these services under 
multi-year contracts, with fixed and variable pricing elements. 
We also provide complementary services including training for 
prospective quality assurance inspectors, training and software 
tools for school leaders to prepare for inspections, online 
professional development tools for teachers to enhance their 
professional development, and other similar offerings. 
QAS revenue declined in the period by 21% to £17.8m. However, 
in March 2017, the final Ofsted contract (“Early Years”) came to 
a successful conclusion, as previously announced, to be taken 
back in-house by Ofsted. Revenues relating to Ofsted contracts 
were £3.0m, down from £11.6m in 2016. 
The remaining Quality Assurance Solutions business, which 
excludes the Ofsted contract, had a strong performance and grew 
by 35% in 2017 , to £14.8m. QAS has secured significant contract 
wins at the Abu Dhabi Education Council, worth £8.4m over two 
years, where we are the sole supplier of school reviews in Abu 
Dhabi, and the Ministry of Education of Dubai & Northern Emirates. 
The first tranche of these contracts was successfully delivered in 
2017 . In the US, we signed an extension to our contract with the 
New York State Education Department, as well as gaining a new 
customer, the Alabama State Education Department. We also 
successfully retendered for the NCETM contract (National Centre 
for Excellence in the Teaching of Maths).
QAS adjusted operating profit was £4.4m (2016: £6.5m), and 
adjusted operating margins were 25% (2016: 29%).

“The successful implementation 
of the single ebs can be largely 
attributed to the efforts of a highly 
skilled, highly capable and motivated 
project team who worked across 
sites to bring this project in on time, 
under budget and in scope. The 
expertise and commitment from 
the Tribal NZ consulting team must 
also be commended. This is the 
first merger project of this scale 
to be delivered and positions the 
organisation well to provide student 
support and services across our 
numerous delivery locations.”
