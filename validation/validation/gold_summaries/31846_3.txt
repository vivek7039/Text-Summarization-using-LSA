 02 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
connecting clients with different 
partners throughout the Group.
The strong performance of Strategic 
Marketing has offset the pressure 
on our Marketing Activation 
businesses, which have contended 
with overcapacity, poor margins and 
additional issues in the key sectors 
of retail and grocery, for a number 
of years. The Books division has 
also been affected by low margins 
and the loss of a major publishing 
contract. We have previously 
outlined a strategic review for both 
of these segments to improve 
efficiencies and reduce costs. This 
process is ongoing and updates  
will be provided in due course.
Governance
The CEO, Matt Armitage, and 
the CFO, Brad Gray, have worked 
tirelessly to tackle the issues in our 
Marketing Activation and Books 
segments. Their diligence and 
calmness under pressure meant  
that short-term considerations  
have not caused us to deviate  
from our strategic priorities. We  
are grateful for their leadership,  
and our goal is for the Group to be 
in a position for them to be able to 
focus on developing our successful 
businesses.
The Board takes its role in corporate 
governance of the Group very 
seriously, implementing rigorous 
and robust systems to ensure we 
meet the high standards demanded 
by our investors and the regulators.
We also take very seriously the 
forthcoming regulatory changes 
that will affect our Data businesses 
in particular: to that end, we have 
appointed John Richmond as 
Data Protection Officer for the 
Group. John will oversee the 
implementation of the General 
Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) 
compliance and lead our collective 
efforts to reduce risk brought about 
by these legal changes.
As for Brexit, the future economic 
effects remain unclear. Although the 
vast majority of our revenues come 
from the UK and US, we continue to 
keep close scrutiny on political and 
fiscal events.
We have taken steps to create 
a culture of knowledge sharing. 
Transfers between roles and 
businesses will continue to be 
offered to employees into the 
new financial year. The long-term 
effect will be individual career 
opportunities and also greater 
J Schwan, founder and CEO of 
Solstice, is increasingly taking 
a leadership role in the mobile 
services sector.
We believe these changes create 
a greater opportunity for the 
businesses to work with each other, 
offering a diverse range of expert 
services to our clients. We hope 
that this will lead to longer-term 
relationships with clients. There 
have already been some exciting 
new contracts, not least within 
our mobile services companies. 
Solstice and The App Business 
(‘TAB’) continue to collaborate and 
thrive through sharing resource and 
working practices, a model we’re 
encouraging businesses across the 
Group to adopt.
Over 200 clients buy services from 
more than one of our companies. 
This is a great credit to the senior 
leaders of the individual businesses, 
who recognise the importance of 
collaboration between our 
companies.
We have completed the first stage 
of a Board evaluation, which is 
carried out every other year. This 
review of our strategy and practices 
allows us to prioritise our efforts for 
growth. We have agreed that our 
number one task is to achieve a 
more stable balance sheet, allowing 
us to consider future acquisitions 
and international expansion from  
a stronger foundation.
Meanwhile, I would like to pay 
tribute to the commitment of 
employees across the Group during 
an uncertain period. I believe that 
their dedication to driving our  
high-quality businesses puts us  
in an excellent position for growth.
We remain committed to each 
individual’ s health and safety, 
whether that is in our offices, 
factories or workshops, in the UK 
and overseas. We constantly review 
systems across all our facilities in the 
belief that everyone has a right to 
risk-free working conditions.
Finally, Ben Gordon has decided to 
stand down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting on 30 November 2017. 
Ben has been a Director for more 
than four years and his extensive 
experience, particularly in the retail 
and books sectors, has made a 
major contribution to the Board’ s 
debates. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank Ben for his 
valuable contribution during his 
time as a Director.
Outlook
On behalf of the Board, I am sorry 
about the share price difficulties 
arising during the last 18 months. 
However, we are clear about the 
best way forward. We will continue 
to monitor changing economic 
conditions and amend our strategy 
accordingly.
All other things being equal, I 
consider us to be well placed to 
achieve solid growth and deliver 
outstanding service to our clients, 
allowing us to deliver increased 
shareholder value in the next 
financial year. I look forward to 
working with the Board and all our 
businesses to make that happen.

achieve solid growth and deliver 
outstanding service to our clients,

shareholder value in the next  
financial year.
Positive  
outlook
It has been a challenging year 
at St Ives, but we end it looking 
forward with optimism based on 
a much-improved performance 
in the second half of the year, as 
mentioned in our trading statement 
in August 2017. Full-year results were 
in line with market expectations and 
we now hope to have put a difficult 
period behind us.
In particular, profitability of the 
Digital businesses within Strategic 
Marketing is driving the Group 
forward, with growth running ahead 
of expectations. There have been 
several changes of leadership 
within the segment, as well as a 
restructuring of our Digital and  
Data businesses. A new 
management team within Digital 
now oversees Amaze, Realise 
and Branded3. In Data, Damian 
Coverdale’ s remit has grown to 
include Occam, Amaze One and 
Bench, alongside Response One.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES

CASE STUDY
Unilever and Amaze are working together to tell 
Unilever’s powerful sustainability story. Every year, 
more than 23 million people from 92 countries  
visit the packaged goods giant’s global network  
of websites. Unilever’s sustainability content  
needs to be accessible to everyone, everywhere  
– from consumers to investors, and nutritionists  
to journalists.
The company’s Sustainable Living Report was 
supported by a growing volume of online content, 
but the user experience had become fractured. 
Content was deeply buried, making it difficult to 
navigate and engage with relevant information. 
A new, streamlined digital sustainability section was 
required for Unilever.com. It required consistent 
navigation and signposting to make complex 
information easy to access, understand and share.  
It also had to be rolled out across 47 international 
sites in 28 languages.
Amaze explored digital data insights across the 
network to understand visitors and their journeys, 
and inform a strategy. This involved:
• conducting a twelve month, on-site survey  
across all of Unilever’s websites;
• reviewing Unilever.com against industry best 
practice to identify improvement areas; and
• developing personae based on insights to test 
and improve target audience understanding.
In addition to creating a simpler and more coherent 
navigation system that adapts as the user travels 
deeper into the sustainability content, Amaze has 
introduced new components that help to create a 
richer visual design, with better signposting for the 
reader, and improved content findability. 
Other innovations include a one-page creative 
summary of the Sustainable Living Report, 
interactive content, shareable modules and  
shorter case studies showcasing Unilever’s  
work on the ground.
The sustainable living section of Unilever.com saw 
a 56% increase in views year-on-year and a healthy 
uplift in reading time. Most tellingly of all, 43% of 
consumers confirmed they would be more likely  
to buy a Unilever product after visiting the site.
