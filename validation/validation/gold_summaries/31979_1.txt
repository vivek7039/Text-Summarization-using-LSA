Our satellites provide high performance, affordable 
connectivity to governments, businesses and 
individuals across EMEA either directly through 
satellite dishes installed at the user location, or by 
providing backhaul connectivity to mobile networks. 
Trading 
Trading in the first half of the year was slower than hoped for 
primarily as a result of the uncertainty associated with the strategic 
review which the Company initiated in July 2016. 
This uncertainty manifested itself in lower than normal levels of 
pipeline conversion and an extension in the sales cycle. Of the high 
probability pipeline that existed at 30 June 2016, 30% was signed 
by 31 December 2016 compared to historic conversion rates of 
over 60%. Since the conclusion of the strategic review and the 
successful provision of additional financing, we won some 
significant new business and believe that the pipeline conversion 
rate should now accelerate. 
In late December 2016 we received significant new tender awards 
and signed contracts in the wi-fi and cellular backhaul markets and 
in government networks.  We also picked up new customers for 
broadband in Europe, spurred by our launch of new 40Mb 
platforms – the highest speed satellite broadband in Europe.  
In the second half of the year we saw some confidence return to our 
customer base and secured some excellent contract wins across all 
four markets of Broadband, Government, Enterprise and Backhaul. 
A few notable examples are: 
Satellite and Terrestrial Network for 5G (SaT5G). This project will 
research, develop and validate key technologies required to enable 
the plug-and-play integration of satellite communications into 5G 
networks. The project will trial and assess these through live 
testbed demonstrations across Europe. The goal of the project is to 
deliver the seamless, and economically viable, integration of 
satellite into 5G networks to ensure ubiquitous 5G access 
everywhere. The project has identified a range of primary research 
areas to address the integration of satellite into 5G networks, which 
include extending 5G security to satellite and multicast for content 
distribution. Each research area will deliver outputs and benefits in 
relation to 5G ecosystem stakeholders. Live demonstrations and 
validations will take place at the testbeds for the project which are 
located in the UK, Germany and Finland. The project will also drive 
standardisation, mainly in 3GPP and ETSI, contributing to the 
definition of the 5G system and integration of satellite 
communications. 
The ERDF contract, which was signed in August 2016, will support 
the deployment of 40Mbps broadband services to rural businesses 
across Cornwall and Isles of Scilly. Services are available through 
Avanti’s certified service providers, Bentley Walker and SSW. The 
service will provide the highest satellite broadband speeds 
available in Europe via Avanti’s Ka-band HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2 
satellites to Cornish businesses, no matter how rural the location.  
In March, the Company announced a partnership with leading 
international telecommunications company Millicom, to bring 
broadband connectivity to consumer, enterprise and government 
applications. This will include the deployment of the Avanti ECO 
initiative across Sub-Saharan Africa, which will provide ECO Wi-Fi 
services to schools and communities, addressing the digital divide 
in the region. By combining Avanti’s world leading satellite 
technology with the market reach expertise from Millicom, the 
partnership will additionally commission a new Gateway Earth 
Station (GES) in Senegal. 
Pricing 
As we reported at the end of the last financial year in order to win 
volume in certain markets where end-customers are highly price 
sensitive, such as broadband in Europe, we have adjusted our 
prices. Our products are sold as Mb or managed accounts or as 
fully integrated projects but we calculate the Price, or Yield, per 
MHz per month. Global pricing for satellite capacity is falling in 
many markets, although each region is different. 
Our average price per MHz in the last 12 months across the fleet 
was $1,400.

Satellite assets 
You will note from the financial statements that we have impaired 
the carrying value of HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2.  
HYLAS 1 is 7 years old now and its cost per MHz is high in 
comparison to the new generation of High Throughput Satellites. 
The finite life of the satellite combined with falling capacity prices  
resulted in  an accounting impairment of $53.3m. HYLAS 1 remains 
an integral part of the Avanti fleet, is forecast to generate good 
EBITDA and cash flows, and continues to serve some important 
customers in Western Europe. 
In addition we have impaired HYLAS 2 by $60.8m, once again 
reflecting falling capacity prices and the finite life of the satellite. 
This impairment effectively eliminates previously capitalised 
financing costs leaving the carrying value close to the Net Book 
Value of the procured asset cost. HYLAS 2 is expected to generate 
strong EBITDA and cash flows as revenues grow over the largely 
fixed operating costs of the business. 
The 3GHz ‘HYLAS 2-B’ satellite payload that joined the fleet in 2015 
came online in the period with coverage over France, Germany, 
Poland and the Baltic Sea. The addition of this new capacity, which 
increases available capacity from 14GHz to 17GHz means the 
utilisation metric has been re-based. The amended fleet utilisation is 
in the 30-35% band (June 2016 re-based: 25-30% band).  
The tactical 4 GHz HYLAS 3 is a hosted payload flying on board a 
European Space Agency (‘ESA’) satellite, for which the ESA is 
presently declaring a late-2018 launch which could slip further. We 
are disappointed in the performance of the manufacturer of this 
system and are considering all options.  
The construction of Avanti’s key 28GHz HYLAS 4 satellite is at an 
advanced stage but has experienced some delays in the factory. 
The spacecraft is now expected to be delivered in January 2018 
with a launch in March 2018.  HYLAS 4 will complete Avanti’s 
coverage of EMEA. This will materially enhance the Group’s 
revenue generation potential, largely within the existing fixed cost 
base. The efficient procurement of HYLAS 4 will bring the overall 
fleet cost per MHz down significantly, mitigating some of the effects 
of falling global prices for satellite bandwidth. 
In November 2017, we successfully re-orbited Artemis. 
Working Capital 
The Company had to make a significant provision against a 
government receivable at the end of the year. Avanti had 
contracted with the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to lease 
capacity on its Artemis satellite to support GoI’s need to bring into 
use and maintain its orbital slot at 123 degrees East. The total 
contract value was in excess of $30 million. Avanti performed all of 
its obligations under the contract and had extended payment 
deadlines for GoI to assist with administrative delays. However, 
having received in excess of $12m in the earlier stages of the 
contract, Avanti received no payments for over a year. As a result, 
Avanti terminated the contract and has initiated arbitration 
proceedings in London. The outstanding amount at 30 June was 
$16.8 million and has been fully provided in these accounts. GoI 
has not disputed that the amounts are due and payable. Avanti is 
confident that the arbitration panel will rule in the Group’s favour 
and has provided for the debt at the year end until the uncertainty 
related to the arbitration and particularly enforcing the Group’s 
expectation of the arbitration panel’s ruling has been sufficiently 
reduced.  
Outlook 
HYLAS 4 is due for launch in March 2018 with a target of being in 
orbital position ready for service at the start of the next financial 
year. We are in discussion with a number of current and new 
distributors to sign up master partnership distribution agreements 
with Avanti to market this new capacity which is largely over sub 
Saharan Africa countries.
