 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Focused on growing recurring revenues
Dear shareholders
Overview
GAN is successfully established as a leading 
provider of enterprise-level Internet gaming 
technology solutions to major US casino 
operators securing significant US market share. 
2017 was our fourth year of continued and 
necessary substantial investment, opening the 
Group to major commercial opportunities, 
including Ocean Resort Casino, our second 
client for real money regulated gaming in 
New Jersey, and The Chickasaw Nation for 
Simulated Gaming™ and its Overseas Internet 
Casino WinStar.com, both expected to deliver 
shareholder value future years.
Substantial continued investment has been 
made in the US operational structure to 
develop the Group’s US presence in both the  
real money regulated gaming and Simulated 
Gaming™ markets. In the UK and Bulgaria 
further substantial investment has been  
made in the Group’s software technology  
and its capability to deliver both Simulated 
Gaming™ and real money regulated gaming  
to US casino operators, integrated with the  
US casino operators’ existing land-based 
loyalty programme.
Intra-State regulation of real money Internet 
gaming re-started with Pennsylvania passing 
legislation in October 2017 to permit Internet 
gaming, nearly four years after New Jersey’s 
Internet gaming market commenced. 
Legislative actions also occurred in several 
other US States in 2017, which suggests the 
State-by-State regulation of Internet gaming 
may progress further in the US during the 
course of 2018. In the meantime, Simulated 
Gaming™ continued to materially outperform 
initial expectations and is positioned for 
significant profitable growth in 2018.
During the year the Group launched Simulated 
Gaming™ for five major US casinos located in 
the States of New York, New Jersey, Oklahoma 
and Nevada and signed an additional landmark 
deal with Ocean Resort Casino, a major casino 
property in Atlantic City, formerly known as 
‘Revel Casino’, which is expected to re-open 
as a casino in 2018 with a simultaneous 
launch of GAN’s Internet casino integrated 
with the on-property rewards programme in 
reliance on GAN’s US-patented convergence  
iBridge Framework™.
A multi-year extension for Simulated Gaming™ 
was agreed during the year with a consortium 
of casino operators in Queensland, Australia 
which have been operating Simulated Gaming™ 
focused on Australia since 2015. GAN and  
its clients stand to benefit from potential 
regulation of real money Internet gaming 
which, since September 2017, became 
effectively prohibited as Australian gaming 
legislation was updated to criminalise the 
long-standing activities of offshore Internet 
gaming operators. While other international 
opportunities are being developed the Group’s 
strategic focus remained firmly on the US 
market throughout 2017, emphasised by the 
relocation of selected key personnel from the 
UK to the US in order to better support the 
Group’s activity in its key geographic market.
In New Jersey, the Group delivered strongly  
for Betfair’s regulated Internet casino  
gaming website delivering over 100 
incremental games across desktop and mobile 
devices and consolidating BetfairCasino.com  
as a leading Internet casino operator in New 
Jersey’s regulated Internet gaming market.  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
staff at GAN, the regulators at the New Jersey 
Division of Gaming Enforcement, the 
management of Betfair’s New Jersey 
operations and the operational management  
of Golden Nugget Atlantic City for all their 
support during 2017.
GAN’s enterprise-level technology platform 
for Internet gaming is a scarce asset, managed 
by a team of experienced specialists managing 
one of a handful of fast-growing real money 
regulated gaming businesses in New Jersey. 
Real money regulated gaming in New Jersey 
has proved materially different in both general 
practice and specialist technical requirements 
when compared with European markets. This 
positions GAN to capture significant market 
share in any incremental US intra-State 
markets which may regulate Internet gaming 
over time, including Pennsylvania, New York 
and Michigan.
Navigating GAN back to 
positive clean EBITDA in 
2017, after a multi-year 
investment cycle, has proved 
to be a marathon of shared 
achievement of which directors, 
employees and shareholders 
can all be proud.

STRATEGIC REPORT
10 GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 GAN IS WELL POSITIONED TO CAPTURE 
SIGNIFICANT MARKET SHARE IN ANY 
INCREMENTAL US INTRA-STATE MARKETS
During the year, the Group achieved strong 
financial growth in recurring net revenues 
derived from the US and the regulated Italian 
market driven primarily by Simulated Gaming™ 
nationwide across the US and from regulated 
real money Internet gaming in both New Jersey 
and Italy. Overall net revenue grew by 17% to 
£9.1m (2016: £7.8m).
Strategy
Expansion in the US remains a continuing  
strategic priority for the Group with requisite 
increases in US infrastructure centred on Las 
Vegas comprising principally human resource 
and licensing investment in relevant US States, 
including New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Aligned with the significant growth 
experienced in New Jersey’s real money 
Internet gaming market the Group increased 
its focus on real money Internet gaming 
product development, enhancements and 
optimisations while continuing to roll out 
additional new clients and product features  
for Simulated Gaming™. The continued 
contribution of Simulated Gaming™ to our net 
revenue growth in 2017 supports the Group’s 
internal focus on the US in delivering both  
real money Internet gaming and Simulated 
Gaming™ to as many major US casino 
properties as possible. Furthermore, the Group 
has received indications from collaborating 
clients that GAN’s unique Simulated Gaming™ 
platform has materially increased patrons’ 
visitation on-property, re-activated significant 
numbers of long-term inactive patrons and 
generally proved highly supportive of 
on-property real money land-based gaming.
The Group continues to pursue further 
Internet gaming platform sales discussions 
with casino equipment manufacturers in  
order to enable land-based casino slot 
manufacturers to manage the distribution  
of their content online. The slow pace of 
incremental regulation of Internet gaming in 
the US has materially contributed to ongoing 
delays in securing an Internet gaming platform 
sale and with the re-commencement of the 
regulatory cycle it appears possible that 
demand for a system sale may return, over time.
Investment in the Group’s technical capability 
in key areas such as back office, mobile  
and convergence with land-based casino 
management systems continued throughout 
2017 with significant continued growth of  
the Group’s mobile gaming portfolio in both 
HTML5 and native iOS and Android applications.
In Europe, the Group extended its market 
position in Italy with new clients integrated 
including Intralot Italia, together with new 
content portfolios delivered via the Group’s 
technical platform. Italy remains a crucial 
market for GAN as a comprehensively 
regulated Internet gaming market exhibiting 
continued organic growth throughout 2017 
as a result of the regulation of Internet casino 
slots gaming in 2013.
Products
The Group’s back office system iSight Back 
Office™ received continuing upgrades released 
throughout 2017 delivering a state-of-the-art 
back office player management capability  
with unique convergence features designed  
to complement a land-based casino’s existing 
gaming operations.
The product-related capabilities of Simulated 
Gaming™ took major strides in 2017 with a 
focus on monetisation of players and the 
introduction of gaming activity accelerants 
designed to extend player lifetimes, increase 
frequency of purchases and drive increased 
visitation to the US casino operators’ land-
based properties. Social gaming features 
including daily bonusing wheels, leaderboards, 
real time competition slot tournaments and 
experience points all launched in 2017, 
resulting in a significant increase in both 
monetisation and stickiness.
“Expansion  
in the US remains  
a continuing  
strategic priority 
for the Group.”
Dermot Smurfit, Chief Executive Officer
In 2017 the Group’s research and development 
function developed a comprehensive  
machine learning framework for delivering 
predictive analytics to clients for both real 
money Internet gaming and Simulated 
Gaming™. Analytics form a critical support  
for marketers in identifying high-value 
customers and maximising lifetime values  
and these capabilities have greatly enhanced  
the analytics tools already available within  
iSight Back Office™ as well as the efficiency  
of marketers using these tools daily to drive 
their respective businesses.
Marketing and support services
Throughout 2017, the Group continued  
to invest in establishing a wide range of 
secondary and tertiary services for US  
land-based casino clients designed to support 
the land-based casino operator in managing 
customers and growing through external user 
acquisition marketing and internal cross-sell 
marketing to existing patron databases and 
on-property traffic.
Marketing and support services remain a 
crucial component of the Group’s service 
portfolio, ensuring any land-based casino 
operator can cost-effectively launch a turnkey 
managed Internet gaming service and grow  
an online community extending beyond its 
existing audience of casino patrons.
