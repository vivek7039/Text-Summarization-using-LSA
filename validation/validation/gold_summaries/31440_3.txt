 Dear Shareholders
2017 was another successful year  
for Vitec, with a good trading performance, 
continued underlying growth and significant 
progress on strategic objectives. Vitec 
delivered a good set of financial results for 
2017, with underlying sales and profit growth, 
and a record level of revenue and profit 
before tax. The Company’s share price rose 
from £6.48 at the start of January 2017  
to £11.30 on 31 December 2017.
As a consequence, the Board recommends  
a final dividend of 20.1 pence per ordinary 
share (2016: 17.3 pence) which, subject to 
approval by shareholders at the 2018 AGM, 
will be paid on Friday 18 May 2018. 
In 2017, we streamlined our portfolio of 
businesses, successfully selling the non-core 
businesses of Haigh-Farr and Bexel, our  
US Services business, for a combined net 
consideration of £33.2 million. We acquired 
the JOBY and Lowepro brands, as well as  
the higher technology business of RTMotion. 
This streamlining of Vitec’s business portfolio 
will in the future deliver enhanced financial 
performance and higher margins for the 
Company and we will continue to explore 
bolt-on investment opportunities in our  
core and adjacent markets.
2018 also promises to be an exciting  
year for Vitec. We have moved to a three 
divisional structure – with Imaging Solutions, 
Production Solutions and Creative Solutions 
addressing our core photographic, broadcast 
and independent content creator customers. 
The Production Solutions Division will relocate 
its Bury St. Edmunds operation into a new 
purpose-built manufacturing site nearby in  
H1 2018, demonstrating our confidence  
in the division. We are making excellent 
progress with the integration of JOBY and 
Lowepro into the Imaging Solutions Division, 
and Creative Solutions now has critical mass, 
growth potential and the talent to stand on  
its own as a separate division.
Martin Green joined the Board on 4 January 
2017 as Group Business Development Director. 
Kath Kearney-Croft joined the Board on  
24 April 2017 as Group Finance Director.  
The Company has a strong executive 
management team to deliver our strategic 
growth plans. Mark Rollins will be leaving  
the Board as an independent Non-Executive 
Director and Senior Independent Director on 
2 April 2018 to focus on his Chairman’s role 
at Carclo plc. Mark has been a valuable 
member of the Board since joining in October 
2013 and the Board wishes him well for the 
future. To ensure that we have a strong 
independent non-executive presence on the 
Board we have searched for a replacement  
to Mark and we are pleased to report that 
Richard Tyson will join the Board on 2 April 
2018 as an independent Non-Executive 
Director. Richard is Chief Executive Officer  
of TT Electronics plc, holding that position 
since 2014. He was formerly President of  
the Aerospace and Security Division of 
Cobham plc from 2008 to 2014 and a 
member of their Executive Committee. 
Christopher Humphrey will become Senior 
Independent Director in addition to his role  
as Chairman of the Audit Committee with 
effect from Mark ceasing to be a director.   
In 2017, the Board conducted an external 
evaluation of its performance and I am 
pleased to report that the performance of 
your Board and its committees were rated 
highly with the right balance of skills and tone 
from the top, along with the experience to 
meet the challenges of growing the business. 
The detail of this evaluation is covered in the 
Governance Report. 
The Board visited the Teradek business in 
California, US in October 2017 and met with 
the Creative Solutions senior management 
team, including the founders of each of the 
constituent businesses of Teradek, SmallHD, 
Paralinx, Wooden Camera and RTMotion.  
This was an exceptionally valuable exercise  
in building the Board’s knowledge and 
understanding of the new division and the 
talent of the divisional team. I am confident 
that with this talent in Creative Solutions,  
as well as the talent in Imaging Solutions  
and Production Solutions, the Company is 
well positioned for further success and to  
be able to deliver further growth in 2018.
Our excellent progress in 2017 and future 
success is down to the hard work and 
dedication of all our employees around  
the Group, and on behalf of the Board I  
thank each one of them for their dedication  
in delivering the Company’s purpose of 
providing vital products and solutions  
that support the capture and sharing  
of exceptional images.
I, and all my Board colleagues, plan to attend 
the AGM on 15 May 2018 and we look 
forward to the opportunity to meet with as 
many shareholders as possible on the day.
