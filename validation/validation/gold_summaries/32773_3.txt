Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
A Year of 
Strong Growth
“We are pleased with the portfolio’s 
overall performance, especially given the 
current uncertainties in the market, and 
will be concentrating on further lettings 
and active management initiatives 
to continue driving growth forward”
Whilst the political and economic uncertainty 
of 2016 continues to play out, the 
underlying quality of Circle Property Plc’s 
portfolio of regional offices and the wealth 
of experience and expertise inherent 
within its management team has driven 
a period of growth for the Company. 
Circle has successfully realised a year-on-year 
growth of 19.9% in NAV, delivering a final NAV 
of 183p per share, as well as a proposed final 
dividend of 2.6p per share, an increase of 8.3%, 
to bring the annual dividend to 5p. This growth 
has come almost entirely through the team’s 
strong asset management and stock picking 
capabilities, with asset-transforming capex 
programmes at key sites including K2, Kents 
Hill Park in Milton Keynes and 36 Great Charles 
Street in Birmingham, which reached completion 
in the period, as well as solid progress being 
made at Somerset House in Birmingham’s CBD. 
Circle’s high level of tenant retention is largely 
attributable to both the high standards of 
management that we demand within our 
multi-let properties and our flexible approach 
to tenant renewal negotiations. Our vacancy 
rate in the standing investment portfolio is less 
than 1% as, where appropriate, we continue to 
place a greater emphasis upon the certainty of 
secure income and the creation of longer leases 
in preference to the maximisation of rents.
It is the strength of Circle’s asset management 
that differentiates the Company from its 
peers. In order to achieve lettings in a highly 
competitive market, it is essential to respond 
swiftly to tenants’ ever-changing occupational 
demands. By listening to tenants and taking 
advice from agents, the Company remains 
totally aware of emerging occupier trends, 
such as the increasing preference towards 
characterful or individualistic offices, and is 
able to increase value by providing supply for 
this demand. This strategy to deliver best-in-
class office properties in regional locations 
was further supported by the successful 
refinancing of Circle’s senior debt with RBS 
following the agreement of a new £50m facility.
Circle is well positioned in this uncertain 
political and economic environment with a 
closely managed business, a positive strategy 
and an entrepreneurial management team 
ready to exploit emerging opportunities..
