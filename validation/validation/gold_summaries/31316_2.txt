1 In 2017 the Board has taken the decision to change the presentation of the underlying 
performance measures to now include other operating income. The Board believe this 
income is an integral feature of the replacement of meters, particularly prevalent during the 
current smart domestic rollout, and will occur with greater regularity on an ongoing basis. 
All prior year underlying results have been restated in accordance with this new approach.
2 Recurring revenue refers to revenue generated by meter rental and data contracts. 
Annualised recurring revenue refers to the revenue being generated at a point in time.
3 Pre-exceptional EBITDA and underlying PBT figures are presented under our revised 
approach to include other operating income.
4 Underlying PBT is before exceptional items and intangible amortisation. 
5 Underlying earnings per share is profit after taxation but before exceptional items and 
intangible amortisation, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
