STRATEGIC REPORT
Arrow Global Group PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FURTHER GROWTH & 
CONSISTENT DELIVERY
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
 “Arrow Global’s stated mission is 
to ‘Build Better Financial Futures’ 
and I believe that the strides the 
Company has made this year put 
it in a stronger position to do 
this than ever before.”
Another strong year of growth and delivery 
I am pleased to be able to present another strong set 
of financial results during a year which saw the Company 
continue to register significant growth and add another 
market to our geographical footprint. 
We have continued to diversify our earnings, with further 
growth in our high quality, capital light income from our 
asset management business, which grew revenues by 53.5%. 
We are a more diversified Group than ever before, growing 
the geographical and asset class mix of our debt purchase 
business by investing 36.7% of our capital in the UK, 24.7% 
in Portugal, 18.9% in Italy and 19.7% in Benelux. During the 
year, we completed the acquisitions of Zenith in Italy and 
Mars Capital in the UK and Ireland, significantly enhancing 
our European capabilities. 
Profit after tax increased by 51.7% to £39.9 million giving 
an increase in basic earnings per share of 51.0% to 22.8p. 
Financially, we have again delivered against our guidance, 
with underlying basic earnings per share increasing 24.1% 
to 32.4p and underlying return on equity increasing by 
3.8 percentage points to 32.9%.  05
Strategic report

This strong performance enables us to propose a final 2017 
dividend of 8.1p, bringing the full year dividend to 11.3p 
(2016: 9.1p) which is at the top of our payout range. Once 
again, balance sheet strength and management is key to the 
business’ success and earlier in the year we undertook a highly 
successful refinancing, securing a material reduction in our 
cost of funding with our weighted average cost of debt falling 
below 4.0% at the same time as extending duration.
The evolution of our model
Our strategy of building top three positions in our chosen 
European markets has remained on track throughout 2017. 
The servicing capabilities we have continued to build, 
underpinned by the strong relationships we have with 
institutional investors, has meant our asset management 
division has been the fastest growing part of the Group. 
The highly cash generative nature of this business has 
further improved the quality of the Company’s earnings 
stream. We have a clear plan in place to continue to grow 
this business as we identify further high value niches within 
our large markets where Arrow’s superior technology, data 
and relationships provide us with a competitive advantage. 
Group governance
The Group operates in a number of countries with strong 
local management teams that have responsibility for 
their operations. This structure has been enhanced by the 
appointment of Dave Sutherland as Group chief operating 
officer, who the country management teams now report 
to. The appointment of our new Group chief risk officer, 
Clodagh Gunnigle, earlier in the year has also brought 
greater structure and diligence to our risk and governance 
procedures, with Group wide risk and compliance teams all 
reporting to her . This revised structure has allowed management 
at the Group level to focus on strategy, origination and capital 
allocation. Overseen by our Group chief executive officer 
and Group chief financial officer, I believe that this is the 
most efficient structure for the Group’s governance and 
consider the company very well positioned to perform 
optimally at the operational level. 
The Board
The Arrow board is a strong group of highly experienced 
individuals who all bring valuable experience and skills 
to bear in Arrow’s thinking and strategy. Last year, we 
announced that we had appointed Paul Cooper as our new 
Group chief financial officer. His strong financial services 
experience and track record of driving operational change 
through large companies, means he is a great addition to the 
team. Our previous Group chief financial officer, Rob Memmott, 
left us at the end of February 2018, and I would like to thank 
Rob on behalf of the Board for his dedication and the important 
role he has played in successfully growing the Company. Our 
Group chief executive officer, Lee Rochford, continues to 
deliver effectively on the Group’s strategic objectives. Lee leads 
a strong Executive team comprising a mix of established 
members and new hires. Their energy, commitment and 
focus on key strategic deliverables have had a marked 
impact on our results.
One Arrow – fostering a culture that underpins our values
Arrow’s mission statement is to ‘Build Better Financial Futures’ 
for our customers across all the markets in which we operate. 
In order to continue to build and improve on this goal, 
throughout the course of the year we launched each of our 
four Group values: ‘We succeed together’, ‘We’re trusted 
and valued’, ‘We’re brave and creative’ and ‘We do the right 
thing’. In order to embed these into our Company DNA and 
Group-wide approach to our operations, the management 
team embarked on a series of roadshows around all countries 
in the Group to present their vision for the business and get 
feedback from employees. I am pleased to say that feedback 
to this initiative from across the Group has been overwhelmingly 
positive, and it is a great source of pride for us that our 
employees are so committed to a positive working culture 
focused on excellent customer experience and outcomes.
Looking forward
I am pleased that Arrow has registered another year of 
strong growth and that so much has been achieved to 
integrate the business more fully, ensuring we are well 
positioned to continue to deliver the consistent financial 
performance we have registered since IPO. 
We are well positioned for 2018: the market opportunity 
for the business remains compelling and I believe we 
have the strategy, management team and employee base 
to continue to deliver on market expectations. 
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow board members, 
the senior leadership team and all colleagues for their hard 
work and commitment in 2017, and our shareholders for 
their ongoing support as we continue to evolve Arrow’s 
differentiated business model. I look ahead with a great deal 
of confidence for the business. The opportunities for Arrow 
are significant and I believe we have the right skill set at all 
levels of the Company to capitalise on them and continue 
to deliver growth and value.
