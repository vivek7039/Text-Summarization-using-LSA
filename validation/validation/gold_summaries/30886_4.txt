OUR AIM
To be the most sophisticated purchaser and 
specialist asset manager of debt portfolios 
across all of our markets.
OUR CORE BUSINESS MODEL
1.  Debt purchase 
We buy debt at a discount to face value and use our data, analytics, 
and collections expertise to provide our customers with flexible 
payment plans, resulting in collections significantly above cost 
of acquisition.
2. Specialist asset management 
We advise on, manage and collect debt portfolios, generating fee 
income from clients. Often, we will co-invest alongside clients, 
ensuring our interests are fully aligned. Our model consists of both 
primary servicing (where we service the debt directly for clients) and 
master servicing (where we provide oversight on behalf of our clients 
to ensure their portfolio is placed with the best primary servicer 
to deliver their investment targets).

January 2018 will accelerate 
provisions by banks, meaning
