Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s Statement
A Successful Year
The past 12 months has been an exciting 
time for our business, as we transitioned to a 
public company following our IPO in October 
2016. This was a significant milestone for 
Biffa, achieved despite uncertain capital 
markets, and has positioned the Group well 
for the future. It has also proved to be another 
successful year for the business and I am 
delighted to report a continued strong 
performance. The strength of our business 
model combined with the execution of our 
strategy has once again delivered growth. 
Performance Overview
Biffa traded strongly in the year, delivering 
robust Net Revenue growth of 8.3% to 
£898.8m and Underlying Operating Profit 
margin expansion from 6.7% to 7 .5%. The 
Group has delivered good organic growth, 
driven by new business and improved 
operational efficiencies, as well as an 
encouraging contribution from acquisitions. 
The business remains well positioned in all 
its key markets.
• In the I&C division, ongoing pricing discipline 
and a steady flow of customer wins 
delivered Organic Revenue Growth of 5.9%, 
while acquisitions added 3. 1 % to revenues 
for the year. Significant new corporate 
customer contracts included John Lewis 
Partnership, Coca Cola Enterprises and 
Engie, achieved as a result of our national 
presence and integrated service offering. 
The I&C division showed continued margin 
Ian Wakelin – Chief Executive 
progression with operating margins for  
the year increasing to 7 .4% from 5.7%, 
driven by operational efficiencies and 
acquisition synergies.
• The Municipal division has recorded a solid 
performance in a competitive market. We 
have delivered the underlying operating 
margin growth in our municipal contract 
portfolio by improving cost efficiency and 
successfully integrating the recent Cory 
Environmental Municipal Services (Cory) 
acquisition. Another strong customer 
relationship performance, with new 
business wins and 100% contract 
extensions, was also achieved.
• In the RR&T division, infrastructure and 
operational improvements in our recycling 
facilities have continued and together with 
improvements in underlying commodity 
prices supported the 1 14.8% increase in 
Underlying Operating Profit across the 
division. New projects in soil treatment and 
aggregates recycling, as well as upgrades to 
glass processing, have also improved 
operating efficiency and quality. Landfill 
volumes remained strong in the year.
• The Energy division delivered a solid 
operational performance with year-on- 
year revenue stable, despite the expected 
reduction in landfill gas volumes which 
were partially offset by the West Sussex 
MBT plant that completed its first full year 
of operations. Reduced operating costs 
also helped offset the natural decline in 
landfill gas output.

Strategic Report
Thirdly, in recent years, Biffa has focused  
on driving value from its existing operations 
by optimising its systems and processes to 
improve the customer experience and reduce 
operating costs. Examples of these efforts  
in the past year include a series of changes  
in I&C to protect margins from increased 
disposal costs alongside pricing discipline, 
and progress in the implementation of a 
groupwide IT modernisation programme  
with the goal of streamlining sales and 
operating processes and enhancing the 
customer experience. 
Acquisitions 
Acquisitions are an important component  
of our Group’s strategy. We continue to  
see opportunities to improve the utilisation  
of our existing asset base, and in this  
regard, will continue to target acquisition 
opportunities where we see clear value 
creation opportunities through asset 
combinations. I am pleased with the level  
of M&A activity this year and I am confident 
that the skills we have developed and 
resources we have mobilised strengthen  
our ability to successfully identify, acquire  
and importantly fully integrate businesses  
into our existing Group.
Our acquisitions are mentioned on page 25, 
but I want to make special mention of a 
couple. Last summer we were delighted to 
acquire the waste collection business of 
Cory, taking over the provision of commercial 
waste collection and recycling services  
to a customer base of about 6,300 I&C 
customers, as well as four major Local 
Authority contracts. In November, the 
acquisition of Blakeley’s Recycling (Blakeley’s) 
was completed, adding to our I&C business 
over 3,400 customers and a large, modern 
and well positioned facility in the North West 
of England. The acquisitions provide further 
demonstration that Biffa is a natural 
consolidator in the industry.
A Platform for Sustainable Growth
Biffa is distinguished from its peers owing  
to its control of waste. This control of large 
quantities of waste is a tangible asset to our 
business whether that be through securing 
commercially attractive outlets for that waste 
or using the control of waste to underpin the 
development of infrastructure.
We have continued to look at the opportunity 
open to us to invest in the continually growing 
Energy from Waste (EfW) market. There is a 
deficit of EfW infrastructure to deal with the 
residual waste arising in the UK. Biffa is very

 was £28.8m, 
substantially increased on the prior year once 
significant one off items are excluded. Our 
Reported Net Debt on 24 March 2017 was 
246. 1m, representing a multiple of 1.8 times 
Underlying EBITDA, comfortably within our 
covenant level.
Our Strategy – Grow, Develop, Optimise
Our strategy continues to deliver results and 
therefore remains unchanged. The Group  
is focused on executing a very clear three- 
pronged strategy around growing market 
share, developing services and infrastructure 
and optimising systems and processes and  
has demonstrated success in all these  
areas over the past 12 months. 
Firstly, we have driven organic growth by 
leveraging our competitive advantages of 
scale, technical expertise and service 
excellence to increase the volume of waste 
collected to 3.8m tonnes. We completed  
5 attractive in-fill acquisitions in the 
fragmented UK waste market to deliver 
significant value as discussed in more detail 
below. The waste management industry 
continues to be one which evolves in a way 
that involves an ever increasingly complicated 
supply chain. This lends itself to larger players 
with the capital, knowledge and technical 
abilities to respond quickly to these changes 
and customer needs.
Secondly, the ongoing strategic development 
of Biffa’s processing infrastructure and 
services is strongly evidenced across the 
business. This includes a new RDF plant  
in Southampton, as well as advancements  
in glass processing, soil treatment and 
polymers in the RR&T division. Measured 
expansion of our capabilities enables us to 
capture more of the value inherent in each 
tonne of waste handled.
well positioned to facilitate the development 
of these required facilities through our control 
of large quantities of waste. We are delighted 
to have reached an agreement with the 
leading EFW developer and operator 
Covanta to jointly explore on an exclusive 
basis the development of two much needed 
facilities in the North West and East Midlands. 
We look forward to reporting again in due 
course on the nature and extent of our 
potential involvement in these two projects.
Our People and Community
The success of Biffa throughout the year  
is in large part due to the unstinting effort  
and commitment of our 7 ,500 employees.  
I would like to personally thank all the people  
of Biffa for their hard work and dedication, 
especially through a demanding listing 
process. We have worked hard on our 
employee engagement programmes over 
many years, and I was delighted to see  
our employee engagement score improve, 
once again. 
Biffa’s strategy is supported by sound 
business processes and a commitment to 
fulfilling our responsibilities to our employees 
and the wider community. We again made 
good progress with ensuring the health  
and safety of our employees and all other 
stakeholders. In particular, during the year  
we delivered a 14.3% reduction in reported 
accidents (based on RIDDOR data), and saw 
improvements year on year with all other key 
safety indicators. This performance is the 
direct result of prioritising safety management 
and our efforts will continue in this important 
aspect of our business. We have also 
improved our environmental performance, 
ensuring we continue to fulfil a vital role in 
society in as environmentally a sensitive 
manner as possible.
Prospects
Biffa is a successful business with significant 
potential. The prospects of the Group are 
positive thanks to a competitive market 
position, stable operating environment  
and our ability to grow the business both 
organically and through acquisition. 
We have entered the new financial year  
with continued optimism and at this early 
stage we are confident that the Group will 
deliver results for the year in line with the 
Board’s expectations.
