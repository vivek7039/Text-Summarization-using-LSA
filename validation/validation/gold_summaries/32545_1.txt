CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
TOM ALBANESE
IN FY2017 , VEDANT A DELIVERED A
STRONG PERFORMANCE ACROSS EACH OF THE
KEY FINANCIAL METRICS AND THIS HAS GIVEN
US A GOOD SPRINGBOARD INTO FY2018.
Let me open this report on FY2017 by 
reverting to my statement for the 
previous year. 
In May 2016, we were looking at two 
central themes. First, that Vedanta’s 
low-cost production ethos and focus on 
cash flows positioned us to be highly 
resilient in the face of any prolonged 
downturn in the commodity market. In 
addition, Vedanta was well positioned 
to benefit from any upturn, and that 
we were cautiously optimistic that an 
improvement might come soon. Back to 
today, and I’m pleased to report that the 
market did indeed see a marked upturn, 
and that we made sure we maximised 
the opportunities that came with that 
recovery. In FY2017 , Vedanta delivered a 
strong performance across each of the 
key financial metrics and this has given 
us a good springboard into FY2018. 
THE MARKET: RETURNING TO BALANCE 
We saw an altogether better 
environment for our business in FY2017 . 
The commodities sector benefited 
from a combination of positive global 
economic activity, coupled with a 
progressive tightening of commodity 
supply. This resulted in the World Bank 
Commodities Prices Index for minerals 
and metals showing a healthy increase 
of almost 11%
1
 over the year. But the 
news was better still for Vedanta: the 
commodities that performed best 
were also the ones in which we’re 
particularly strong (zinc and oil). This 
meant that Vedanta outperformed the 
sector generally, registering a significant 
increase. Of these commodities, the 
best performer was zinc. Vedanta is 
particularly well placed here, through 
Zinc India’s low costs, its output as 
the world’s second largest producer, 
and through our ramp up of projects at 
Zinc India and at the Gamsberg mine 
at Zinc International. The net result is 
that Vedanta represents one of the 
best opportunities for investors looking 
to participate in the zinc market. 
When we look at the key demand 
drivers, there was much concern a year 
ago about China. Despite a continuing 
growth rate that was the envy of most 
economies, the debate was whether 
China would go through a hard or soft 
landing. Since then, financial reform and 
fiscal stimulus have made analysts more 
confident of a soft landing trajectory, and 
this has certainly been our view in the 
specific area of metals. 
Equally significant is that the strong 
improvement in the US economy has 
given the sense that, for the first time 
in a long period, there is a positive 
economic outlook globally. This was 
shown by how the market absorbed 
the considerable political and economic 
shocks that came from the elections 
and the markets during the year. 
This augurs well for commodities which, 
for the first time in five years, closed 
the year higher than they were at the 
outset. In addition to the more benign 
global environment, this was due to 
supply-side expansions of the last 10 
years having run their course. This led 
to the emergence of supply pressures 
not seen since 2011 and, in the case of 
zinc, absolute shortages. Indeed, we are 
under no illusions: volatility is a given in 
our sector, and our focus never wavers 
from exerting tight fiscal discipline and 
maintaining a robust balance sheet. 
HIGHLIGHTS
I’m pleased to report progress on a 
range of areas across the business, 
together with various challenges and 
tasks addressed and resolved.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT 
Vedanta is committed to protecting the 
health and safety of our employees 
and stakeholders who might be 
impacted by our operations. We operate 
a policy of ‘zero harm’, so it is with 
deep regret that we recorded seven 
fatalities during the year. Four occurred 
in a single tragic crane accident at 
our zinc operations in Rajasthan.
No injury of any kind is ever acceptable, 
and our non-negotiable principle is that 
everyone who works with us – direct 
employees or visiting contractors – 
should go home safe.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
We continue to analyse every incident, 
and through acting on what we learn, our 
safety KPIs have showed measurable 
improvements, with LTIFR down to 0.39 
(FY2016: 0.51). However, it is clear that 
more is needed.
Our sustainable development agenda  
is at the core of Vedanta’s strategic 
priorities and governs every business 
decision. During the year, our social 
investment stood at US$18 million and 
our efforts benefited 2.2 million people 
across 576 villages and 1,142 peripheral 
villages where we operate.
Vedanta is a strong advocate of child 
development and women empowerment. 
In India, we are transforming 4,000 
state-run child welfare centres into 
pre-fabricated units with the latest 
technology and modern amenities 
known as ‘Nand Ghars’ (also known as 
Anganwadi). These centres will be the 
convergence point for a number of 
government programmes such as clean 
water, sanitation facilities and electricity, 
with additional services such as primary 
healthcare, women empowerment and 
entrepreneurship training. 
In South Africa, we are supporting Pink 
Drive, a non-profit organisation to create 
awareness on breast cancer. Vedanta  
is also promoting skill development 
amongst youth in addition to agriculture, 
livestock and livelihood development 
programmes in India and Africa. In 
FY2017 , for example, we assisted  
90,000 farmers.
We are a signatory to the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development 
‘WASH’ (Water and Sanitation Hygiene) 
pledge. Under this we provide access  
to safe drinking water and promote best 
hygiene practices among employees and 
the community. 
Our focus on sustainable development, 
inclusive growth and greater value 
creation for all our internal and external 
stakeholders is critical to ensure the 
future of our operations and helps us 
earn our social licence to operate.
Vedanta is also determined to minimise 
the impact of our operations on the 
environment. As a resources company,  
we appreciate the vital importance of 
using resources wisely, and one example 
is our water recycling programme that  
is now delivering water recycling rates  
of 24%. 
We will maintain our focus on 
those factors that are in our 
control. This includes the safe 
expansion of our production, 
optimising costs, leveraging 
technology to run our business 
even more productively, and 
continuing our disciplined 
approach to capex.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
We are also operating waste-to-revenue 
retrieval programmes, and during the 
year we will send about 50% of our fly 
ash waste for re-use in construction 
materials. 
Our operations are mostly located in 
developing countries where growth of 
the country and human indices are 
dependent on reliable and affordable 
coal-based power. We are committed  
to the climate change agenda and set  
up a Carbon Forum anchored by our 
CEO, Power with representation from 
the businesses to guide the Group 
Executive Committee on our climate 
change mitigation programme. Practical 
examples of this include an investment 
in a 16MW solar power project by our 
Zinc business in India.
CAIRN INDIA AND VEDANTA LIMITED  
MERGER COMPLETED
I am pleased that we closed the year 
by completing the merger of Cairn 
India Limited into Vedanta Limited. 
The objective here is to simplify 
our Group structure, and the move 
followed the strong approval from 
all sets of shareholders and the 
necessary regulatory permissions. 
We see synergies ahead, principally 
through a more efficient balance sheet 
and through being able to allocate capital 
with more flexibility. We continue to be 
committed to expand energy production 
through Cairn, one of the largest oil & gas 
private producers in India, focusing on the 
major discoveries at the Rajasthan block. 
VOLUME RAMP UP
We achieved increased production 
across key commodities within our 
business. 
 ❯ Aluminium. We began ramping up 
on 1 April 2016. At that point our run 
rate was approximately 900ktpa and 
by the close of the year we saw over 
30% increase to 1.2 million tonnes. 
This improvement was not as fast 
as we had hoped, stalled by a few 
operational outages. However, 
the ramp up in Q4 FY2017 saw 
production at a record level, up 56% 
year-on-year and marking strong 
progress towards our total production 
capacity of 2.3 million tonnes for 
aluminium.
 ❯ Power. The full 1,980MW Talwandi 
Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) in Punjab 
became operational this year, enabling 
the business to contribute improved 
earnings. 
 ❯ Iron Ore. It is good to report that the 
mining ban in Goa is now in the past, 
and during the year we ramped up 
production within the mining cap 
limits. We have also been able to 
control costs, producing iron ore at a 
cash cost comparable with some of 
the world’s largest operations. India’s 
geology is similar to that of Western 
Australia, the world leader in iron ore 
mining, and a lot needs to be done to 
realise the resource potential of the 
country.
 ❯ Copper Zambia. We remained 
focused on improving volumes and 
cost at this asset but this was 
impacted by lower production due  
to low equipment availability. The 
custom production, however, was 
strong post the biennial shutdown at 
the smelter.
CONTINUING COST SAVINGS
We complemented the benefits of better 
market conditions by maintaining tight 
financial discipline. Despite many 
analysts saying that the industry appears 
to have reached ‘peak savings’, our 
programme continues to drive down 
costs intelligently and safely, through 
optimising our plant and through 
achieving material efficiencies across the 
supply chain. We have achieved US$814 
million cost savings over the last two 
years since this cost savings programme 
was launched over the base of FY2015.
STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET
These successes play to our fiscal ethos: 
that we should be able to generate 
positive cash flows even in the most 
difficult passages of the market cycle. 
With this in mind, I also want to highlight 
the achievements on the balance sheet. 
Through tight cash flow control and 
capital discipline we have delivered on 
our promise to strengthen the balance 
sheet and extended our average debt 
maturities. This was also complemented 
by the success of our recent US$1  
billion bond issuance, which was 
oversubscribed by three times. This  
bond issuance extended our 2018 and 
2019 debt maturities to 2022. We also 
undertook several other liability 
management initiatives such as the  
bond buybacks and continue work in  
this direction to further strengthen the 
balance sheet. 
FY2018 AND BEYOND
We approach the new financial year  
with optimism. I believe the progressive 
improvements in the markets that we 
saw last year will continue, driven largely 
by supply-side constraints. 
At the same time, we bring a strong 
sense of realism and experience to  
our decision-making: our plans and 
investments do not rely on further help 
from market conditions, and we are 
prepared for volatility at any time. 
We will maintain our focus on those 
factors that are in our control. This 
includes the safe expansion of our 
production, optimising costs, leveraging 
technology to run our business even 
more productively, and continuing our 
disciplined approach to capex. 
On a personal note, I have elected to 
step down as CEO at the end of August 
2017 . I have spent a wonderful three-plus 
years in the role and leave the business 
in a strong position to contribute to, and 
benefit from, the future of India. I have 
always seen this extraordinary country 
as the next great growth vector, and my 
experiences here have only reinforced 
that view. I believe Vedanta will continue 
to be the premier opportunity for those 
investing in India, and I look forward to 
watching the Company’s progress in  
the exciting years ahead.
