 PAGE 10  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Dear Shareholder
I have the pleasure of introducing our first Annual Report and Accounts as Paragon Banking Group PLC, 
following a year which has seen a major restructuring of the Group’s businesses and governance structure as 
well as a significant change in its regulatory profile.
This represents a major milestone in the Group’s strategic development, transitioning to a banking group 
deriving significant funding from retail deposits, while providing new finance options for underserved 
UK customers.
The Group has also made progress in its asset diversification strategy, which will support its medium-term 
objective of improving net interest margin and cost efficiency, with increasing business volumes capable of 
being supported by the investments in operations, infrastructure and start-up costs already being put in place.
As a result of the reorganisation, you will see significant changes in these accounts, both to better reflect the 
new structure of the Group and to enhance comparability with other businesses in the sector. I hope you will 
find these changes helpful.
The business
The business is now managed in three lending divisions, Mortgages, including buy-to-let, Commercial 
Lending and Idem Capital, giving greater clarity of focus on product lines and a more streamlined 
administrative structure.
During the year, the asset finance business acquired in 2015 and the development finance business 
launched organically continued to develop, while the Mortgages division launched its first pilot offerings in the 
specialist owner-occupied mortgage market.
The new financial year will see the first loans in structured lending and aviation finance, as the Group’s 
diversification continues.
Significant cost investment has been made in developing these newer business lines during 2017 and further 
investments are anticipated in the coming year.
The Group’s business is described more fully in section A2
Results
The growth in the Group’s loan books, up 3.6% to £11,124.1 million, contributed to an increase in underlying 
profit by 1.0% to £145.2 million after absorbing £10.9 million of interest cost in respect of the Group’s 
£150.0 million Tier 2 Bond (2016: £143.8 million). Profit before tax on the statutory basis grew by 1.1% to 
£144.8 million. This led to earnings per share increasing by 6.4% to 43.1 pence (2016: 40.5 pence) and return 
on tangible equity reaching 13.4% (2016: 12.9%).
Funding was enhanced with the growth of the Group’s savings deposit base to £3,615.4 million from 
£1,873.9 million a year earlier and the utilisation of the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme (‘TFS’), where 
drawings had reached £700.0 million by the year end.
The Group’s capital position remains strong, with regulatory Core Equity Tier 1 (‘CET1’) capital of £876.1 million 
(2016: £838.6 million). The CET1 ratio at 30 September 2017 remained stable at 15.9% (2016: 15.9%).
The financial results and operational performance are reviewed in section A3

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT PAGE 11  •  Strategic Report PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC  •  2017 Annual Report and Accounts
Stakeholders
The year has seen major developments in the diversity landscape both for corporates generally and within the 
Group. The Group is supportive of the aims of the Women in Finance initiative and committed to its charter in 
the year. We have published our targets for increasing diversity, and will be publishing our first progress report in 
January 2018. We have also submitted data to the Hampton-Alexander review team and calculated our gender 
pay gap under government rules for the first time. The year also saw an increase in female representation on 
the Board.
We recognise the importance of the contribution of the Group’s people to its results in the year and I would like 
to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication throughout the period.
Social responsibility issues are discussed in section A5
Governance
The Group is committed to good corporate governance and complied with the new 2016 version of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) in the year. As part of the Group’s restructuring, I have been delighted to 
welcome four new non-executive directors to the Board, Pat Newberry, Barbara Ridpath, Finlay Williamson and 
Graeme Yorston, significantly adding to the Board’s regulatory and retail banking experience. I look forward to 
working with all of them.
In addition to our normal duties, the entire Board has been much involved with the development and 
implementation of the strategic review, as well as the continuing integration and strategic direction of the 
businesses acquired last year.
Corporate governance is discussed in section B3
Risk
The group restructuring has enabled us to bring together all of the Group’s risk monitoring activities into one 
function, increasing depth of coverage and resilience. As part of the process all risk appetites were reviewed 
and the system to manage them enhanced. Additional resource has been added on prudential, liquidity and 
capital risk matters, meaning the Group is better placed to manage the new risks it encounters as it grows.
The Risk Management report is set out in section B6
Shareholder returns
The group restructuring, together with the positive results have enabled the Board to increase its dividend 
payout policy. As a result, we have declared a final dividend for the year of 11.0 pence per share, bringing 
the dividend for the year to 15.7 pence per share, up 16.3%, subject to shareholder approval. £65.0 million 
(excluding costs) has also been spent on the share buy-back programme which will be continued into the new 
financial year, with the purchase of further shares up to a value of £50.0 million. Each of these actions enhances 
returns for shareholders.
Conclusion
The impact of the group restructuring in the year has made this an interesting and exciting time for the Board. 
Despite economic uncertainties and the potential for more regulatory change, I remain confident that our new 
structure and new product ranges, coupled with the strength of our existing businesses, position us well to 
deliver strong growth and sustainable returns into the future.
