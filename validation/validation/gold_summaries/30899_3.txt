Governance Financial Statements Other Information 03 Strategic Report
This is the third occasion, as Chairman 
of your Board, that I have written to 
you at the start of our Annual Report. 
When we embarked on the Build to 
Last transformation programme our 
commitment was to make Balfour Beatty 
a strong and sustainable company and 
the sector’s leading performer. 
Today Balfour Beatty is clearly focused on 
its chosen markets, winning new business 
on terms and conditions that balance 
risk and reward. Projects are monitored 
rigorously and regularly, with consistent 
processes and systems. The legacy 
contracts, which did so much damage 
to your company, are largely completed. 
This transformation has been 
achieved whilst maintaining one of the 
strongest balance sheets in the sector, 
maximising value in our Investments 
portfolio and paying a sustainable and 
progressive dividend.
It has been a long road, and we still have a 
distance to go; but returning the Group to 
industry-standard margins is now within 
sight. I am proud of the progress we have 
made so far. As we look forward with 
conﬁdence to the rest of 2018 and beyond, 
we will continue to Build to Last and 
strengthen Balfour Beatty. 
Performance
Underlying proﬁt from operations more 
than doubled to £196 million in 2017; 
with all of our earnings-based businesses 
reporting improved proﬁtability.
The Group’s cash performance was strong. 
During the year we had average net cash 
of £42 million – compared to £46 million 
average net debt in the previous year and 
reported year end net cash excluding 
non-recourse borrowings of £335 million. 
Balfour Beatty has a number of outstanding 
debt instruments: as a result of our strong 
ﬁnancial performance we were able to pay 
down some debt at the end of 2017 and 
we intend to reduce gross debt further 
in 2018.
The Investments portfolio maintained its 
Directors’ valuation at £1.2 billion, post 
disposals. The partial sale of our holding 
in the M25, London’s orbital motorway, 
demonstrates our commitment to 
maximise shareholder value, with the 
sale price considerably higher than a 
comparable market transaction from 2016.
We have continued our practice of only 
bidding for work on appropriate terms 
and for those projects best aligned to 
our capabilities. Our year end order book 
was £11.4 billion. 
Markets
In the UK, US and the Far East, 
governments are taking action to renew 
and improve essential infrastructure – 
work which Balfour Beatty is well placed 
to deliver.
Notably, in the UK we were selected to 
deliver two Lots of the new high speed 
railway (HS2) and won orders to construct 
the marine tunnels at the Hinkley Point C 
nuclear power plant. In the US, we secured 
work to reconstruct and improve the 
Southern Gateway – an 11-mile stretch 
of road in Dallas, Texas – and the 4.7-mile 
Green Line rail extension in Boston, 
Massachusetts.
The business continues to work 
constructively with industry bodies and the 
UK Government to identify and manage 
any challenges caused by the UK’s exit 
from the European Union. Whilst we have 
not seen an impact on our markets, any 
restrictions on the movement of workers 
would be likely to exacerbate the current 
shortages of skilled labour in our sector.
We continue to see opportunities for our 
Investments business to ﬁnance and 
deliver projects. In early 2018 we entered 
our ﬁrst major public-private partnership 
(P3) in the US civil infrastructure market 
for the Los Angeles World Airports 
Automated People Mover.
The Board
Barbara Moorhouse and Michael Lucki 
joined your Board in the summer of 2017.
Barbara has over 30 years of business and 
management experience in the private, 
public and regulated sectors. Michael has 
worked with construction and infrastructure 
providers for 40 years and has extensive 
knowledge of the US market.
I consider a balanced spread of disciplines, 
diversity and experience essential to the 
Board’s effectiveness and we will continue 
to take this into account when considering 
additional appointments. 
Very sadly, during the year, Steve Marshall, 
my predecessor as Chairman, passed away. 
I would like to express our condolences to 
his family and recognise the leadership he 
gave Balfour Beatty at a very challenging 
time for the Company.
Our people
The transformation of Balfour Beatty to 
date could not have been achieved without 
the energy, dedication and enthusiasm of 
our employees. On behalf of the Board 
I would like to thank all of our employees 
for their commitment once again this year. 
We are fortunate to work on some of 
the most impressive and exciting projects 
in the world and I am always delighted at 
the level of passion and pride I ﬁnd every 
time I visit a site. 
Safety is at the heart of the culture which 
the leadership team is creating at Balfour 
Beatty. Much of the work we undertake 
is inherently dangerous: taking measures 
which eradicate risk – or mitigate it where 
it cannot be completely removed – is vital 
if we are to ensure that everyone who 
comes into contact with Balfour Beatty is 
kept safe.
It is, therefore, with deep regret that I have 
to report that three people died during 2017 
whilst working on our projects, two in the 
US and one in the Far East. As a Board, we 
review each serious accident in detail and 
seek actions to prevent a reoccurrence; 
however I realise that this is of little comfort 
to the families of those who lost their 
lives and I use this letter to send formal 
condolences to the bereaved on behalf of 
the Board and everyone in our business.
Every time someone is injured, it reinforces 
why we must always strive to do more to 
make our industry safer.
Dividend
The results for 2017 demonstrate further 
progress in restoring Balfour Beatty to 
sustainable ﬁnancial strength and stability. 
As a result, your Board has felt able 
to recommend an increase in the ﬁnal 
dividend to 2.4p per share, bringing the 
total dividend for the year to 3.6p per share.
Conclusion
As we have all been reminded, contracting 
is a business that demands constant focus 
and control. Risks must be managed and 
processes and governance must be ﬁt 
for purpose and continuously applied. 
Delivering this requires quality leadership 
and a systematic approach to creating a 
culture which embeds this as our way 
of working. 
As you read this report, you will see many 
examples of how Balfour Beatty has learnt 
from the past and is embracing these 
disciplines. Today we look to the future 
with conﬁdence and excitement.
Balfour Beatty is ready for the challenges 
ahead. We Build to Last.
