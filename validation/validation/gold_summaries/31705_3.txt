 I am pleased to report a robust set of results  
for the year ended 30 September 2017.
Chairman’s statement
This is our maiden set of results as 
a public company, following the 
Company’s successful Initial Public 
Offering (“IPO”) on the London Stock 
Exchange’s Alternative Investment 
Market (“AIM”) in July 2017. I would 
like to take this opportunity to 
welcome all our new shareholders. 
Overview of the year
The Nexus business model, with 
Tamdown’s well-established market 
position as a leading provider of 
essential infrastructure services 
to the UK’s largest housebuilders, 
coupled with TriConnex’s growing 
utilities connection services, was 
resilient during a challenging year. 
As previously reported, the EU 
Referendum caused a slowdown 
in tendering activity and delays to 
customers awarding new contracts 
during the second half of 2016 
with a corresponding delay to work 
commencing on site. In spite of 
this market backdrop, the Group 
is reporting revenue for the year 
of £135.0m (2016: £135.7m), and 
an operating profit of £9.3m 
(2016: £10.4m). As at 30 September 
2017, the order book was at a record 
level of £202.7m up 25% from 
£161.7m in 2016, providing good 
earnings visibility for the year ahead.

4 Strategy
The Group’s mission is to be 
recognised as the leading provider 
of essential infrastructure services 
in the UK. The Group’s strategy is to 
deliver outstanding performance 
through a focus on innovation and 
customer service which will lead to 
growth, building on existing market 
positions by developing new markets 
and services whilst extending 
geography, both organically and 
through complementary earnings 
enhancing acquisitions. 
The Group’s organic growth strategy 
is focused on four key drivers: 
increasing market share within 
current geographies, expanding 
into new geographies, diversification 
into new growth sectors and 
leveraging customer relationships 
to enhance cross-selling within the 
Group. In addition to organic growth, 
further growth will come from the 
successful sourcing, execution and 
integration of chosen acquisitions. 
The Group is taking a disciplined 
approach to acquisitions, seeking 
to enhance shareholder value with 
acquisitions that are linked or closely 
associated with TriConnex, such as 
businesses within existing residential 
utility or non-residential utilities 
markets or new markets, such as 
continuing to develop our fibre and 
Electric Vehicle charging services. 
Returns to shareholders
As a listed company, one of our 
primary objectives is to deliver 
increased shareholder value over 
time. The Board has adopted a 
progressive dividend policy and has 
already paid an interim dividend of 
2.1p per share. For the year ended 
30 September 2017, the Board is 
proposing a final dividend of 4.2p 
per share, which, if approved at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”), 
will take the dividend for the year 
to 6.3p per share. The total dividend 
for the year of £2.4m is based on 
a dividend cover of 3.0 times the 
Group’s profit after tax, adjusted for 
exceptional items, which is in line 
with our guidance on dividend cover 
stated at the time of the IPO. The 
dividend will be paid on 9 March 
2018 to shareholders on the register 
at close of business on 9 February 
2018. The shares will go ex-dividend 
on 8 February 2018.
Looking forward, whilst continuing 
to invest in the growth plans of the 
business, our adopted progressive 
dividend policy will enable 
shareholders to benefit as the Group 
delivers on its performance targets. 
Board and governance
The Board has been established 
now for over a year, with Richard 
Kilner appointed as Non-Executive 
Director and myself, appointed 
as Non-Executive Chairman, 
in January 2016. Alex Wiseman 
was appointed as Non-Executive 
Director in June 2016. The Board 
consists of five members in 
total, including Executive Board 
Directors Mike Morris (CEO) and 
Alan Martin (CFO).
Since the Board was expanded in 
early 2016, roles and responsibilities 
have been defined and the Board 
has spent time setting out the vital 
discipline, processes and authorities 
of governance. Changes have 
included the creation of Board 
sub-committees in 2016 for Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination, all 
of which were in place throughout 
the year under review.
People
A primary driver to the Group’s 
success is the team of highly skilled, 
driven and loyal employees across 
the businesses. Nexus places great 
importance on engaging with, 
and developing its employees and 
providing a platform for personnel 
growth and successful career 
development. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to congratulate 
and thank them for their continued 
hard work and dedication.
Outlook
We are in a strong position to 
deliver growth. The fundamental 
market drivers for our business look 
positive in the short and medium 
terms. The order book has grown 
significantly over the past year and 
is now at a record level. Against this 
background, the Board is optimistic 
on the outlook for the business and 
is confident the Group will deliver on 
its growth strategy.
