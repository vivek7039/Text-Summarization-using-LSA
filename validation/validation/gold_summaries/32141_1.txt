OVERVIEW
The year to 31 March 2017 has been 
eventful with the real estate sector 
proving resilient against a background 
of both UK and international political 
change. Looking back 12 months it was 
clear that the exceptional growth in 
property values that we experienced 
over the period from 2012 to 2016, as the 
market recovered from the 2008 Global 
Financial Crisis, was coming to an end 
with yields approaching historic lows, 
but with some prospect for growth in 
rental values.
At Helical, we took advantage of the 
strong recovery in property values 
during this period by expanding the 
Company’s business activities, investing in 
development opportunities in London and 
higher yielding regional assets to provide 
a stable flow of rental income. Using the 
proceeds of our 2013 Retail Bond and our 
2014 Convertible Bond, together with 
additional borrowings, we increased 
our property portfolio from £626m at 
31 March 2013 to over £1.2bn, generating 
significant surpluses which have more 
than doubled shareholders’ funds from 
£254m to £517m at 31 March 2017.
During the year we have sought to recycle 
some of the capital created in this period 
into the schemes which we believe will 
continue to support the future growth of 
the Company. We have narrowed the 
focus of the Company to London, offices 
in Manchester and a portfolio of logistics 
units. We expect to complete this process 
during the current year with the sale of the 
remaining non-core assets, being the retail 
properties and regional offices outside of 
Manchester, whilst continuing to work 
through the retirement village programme.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT In the year under review, the majority 
of our performance has come from the 
assets we own in London, where we have 
increased our weighting to 63% of the 
total portfolio. Sales of regional assets 
since the year end have increased this 
London weighting further to 66%. In the 
investment portfolio we have created 
buildings which reflect the needs of our 
tenants, acknowledging that modern 
lifestyles increasingly merge work and 
leisure needs. We now have a portfolio of 
multi-let, flexible and desirable properties 
which also provide ongoing asset 
management opportunities to add 
value. Our London portfolio remains 
reversionary with further value to be 
created through the completion of our 
redevelopment and refurbishment 
programme, letting vacant space and 
upcoming rent reviews.
We believe that London will continue 
to outperform the rest of the UK over 
the medium and long term and our 
strategy is to continue to increase our 
London holdings.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
The profit before tax for the year to 
31 March 2017 was £41.6m (2016: £114.0m). 
Total Property Return reduced to £79.9m 
(2016: £164.6m) and included growing net 
rents of £47.0m, an increase of 8.3% on 
2016 (£43.4m), and development losses 
of £5.7m (2016: profit of £27.5m) after 
deducting provisions of £12.8m 
(2016: £6.4m). The gain on sale and 
revaluation of the investment portfolio 
contributed £38.6m (2016: £93.7m).
Net finance costs of £21.2m were lower 
than in 2016 (£22.6m) and the Income 
Statement benefited from the shortening 
of the maturity period for the Group’s 
remaining interest rate swaps which led to 
a £0.8m credit (2016: charge of £6.9m) 
arising from the valuation of the Company’s 
derivative financial instruments. The 
revaluation of the Company’s Convertible 
Bond provided a credit of £3.0m 
(2016: £0.5m). Recurring administration 
costs were marginally higher at £10.8m 
(2016: £10.7m). Performance related 
awards were substantially lower at £6.9m 
(2016: £13.3m) with National Insurance 
on these awards of £0.7m (2016: £2.1m).
These results allow the Board to continue 
its progressive dividend policy and to 
recommend to Shareholders a final 
dividend of 6.20p which, together with 
the interim dividend of 2.40p paid in 
December 2016, takes the total dividend 
for the year to 8.60p (2016: 8.17p), 
an overall increase of 5.3%.
PERFORMANCE
We measure our performance at both 
portfolio and Company level, seeking 
to outperform the relevant sector indices 
and our peer group in the medium and 
long term.
EPRA earnings per share fell from 17.1p 
to 0.5p, reflecting growing net rental 
income offset by reduced development 
profits. On a like-for-like basis, the 
investment portfolio increased by 5.2% 
(4.5% including sales and purchases). 
Sales during the year offset this growth in 
values contributing to an overall reduction 
in the portfolio value to £1,205m 
(2016: £1,240m). The unleveraged return 
of our property portfolio, as measured 
by IPD, was 9.4% (2016: 21.7%), compared 
to 4.4% (2016: 11.4%) for the benchmark 
index. These investment gains contributed 
to an increase in EPRA net asset value 
per share, up 3.7% to 473p (2016: 456p).
FINANCE
The Company has expanded its activities 
significantly in recent years, seeking to 
increase shareholder funds through the 
generation and retention of increased net 
rental streams, development profits and 
valuation surpluses. This growth has been 
financed through an increase in secured 
debt borrowed primarily from UK high 
street banks and, since 2013, through the 
use of unsecured debt in the form of a 
Retail Bond and a Convertible Bond. In 
assessing the needs of the business the 
Company is conscious that it needs to 
manage any risks inherent in this 
leveraged approach to growing the 
business. It seeks to do this through the 
use of unsecured debt (24% of total debt), 
by maintaining an appropriate debt 
maturity profile and by hedging its 
interest rate exposure.
The Company uses gearing on a tactical 
basis throughout the property cycle, 
being raised to accentuate property 
performance when property returns are 
judged to materially outperform the cost 
of debt and lowered when seeking to 
reduce exposure to the property cycle.
At 31 March 2017, the Company’s 
see-through loan to value (“LTV”), being 
the ratio of see-through net borrowings 
to the value of the see-through property 
portfolio, was 51%. This metric has varied 
between 45% and 55% in the last five 
years and, subsequent to the year end, 
has fallen below 50% following the 
recent sales of properties in Cardiff 
and Great Yarmouth.
Looking forward, the Company will 
seek to operate within an LTV range 
of 40%-50% for the foreseeable future, 
subject to being able to maximise 
opportunities in the market whilst 
remaining aware of the risks of higher 
levels of gearing.
During the year, the average debt maturity 
reduced to 3.6 years (2016: 4.5 years), 
with no secured loan repayable before 
November 2019, whilst marginally 
increasing the average cost of debt at 
4.3% (2016: 4.2%). The Company has 
a significant level of liquidity with cash 
and unutilised bank facilities of £267m 
(2016: £193m) to fund capital works 
on its portfolio.
BOARD MATTERS
In July 2016, I became CEO of Helical plc 
succeeding Michael Slade who became 
the Company’s Non-Executive Chairman. 
The Board also consists of three 
Executive Directors and five Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Our Executive 
team has an average of over 19 years’ 
experience at Helical and are supported 
by a strong team of property and finance 
professionals and administrative staff.
THE FUTURE
Helical has a dynamic portfolio 
with good upside potential through 
a combination of development, 
refurbishment and significant asset 
management opportunities. We believe 
our concentration on offices and 
mixed use assets in London, offices 
in Manchester and well located logistics 
units will provide capital growth from 
development gains and rising 
income streams.
We have ambition to continue to grow 
the Company and have actively sought 
to add to our development pipeline with 
exciting new schemes, particularly in 
London. Rebalancing the portfolio 
through the sale of non-core assets 
enables us to recycle some of the capital 
we have created in recent years and fully 
pursue those opportunities that we 
have identified.
