The term “underlying” has been used to improve comparability between the 52 week reporting period ended 28 January 2017 and the 53 weeks 
ended 30 January 2016. In the 53 week reporting period ended 30 January 2016 the Group received non-recurring income associated to the 
termination of the Orangina franchise and incurred one-oŽ transaction fees associated to corporate development activities including Funkin Limited. 
The underlying ﬁgures for the 53 week reporting period ended 30 January 2016 have been adjusted for the revenue and proﬁt associated to 
week 53 and the non-recurring Orangina franchise and one-oŽ corporate development transaction fees. 
The underlying ﬁgures for the period ended 28 January 2017 are the reported ﬁgures before exceptional items as disclosed in the consolidated 
income statement.
