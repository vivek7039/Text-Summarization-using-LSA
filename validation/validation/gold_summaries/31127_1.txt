CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
“The Company is in the process of
analysing the latest drilling results,
with the next step to refine the
production techniques and
subject to sourcing additional
funding, establish a pilot plant for
production at a later stage.”
Overview
As an update on the licences:
 The extension to the Smirnovskoye licence and
associated work programmes was agreed with
the Kazakh authorities and the licence extended
to September 2019.
 The extension to the Drozhilovskoye licence and
associated work programmes is with the Kazakh
authorities, and is in the final administrative
stages of sign off.  Final sign is expected in
Q2 2018, and the licence extension will run for
2 years from the date of signing.  
The Company has been moving forward with the
development of the sites with a view to moving to
production.  The initial starting point is the analysis
of samples that were extracted at Drozhilovskoye.
Once this has been completed and the
technological basis for extracting the three
principal minerals Molybdenum, Tungsten and
Lithium from the ore a production plan will be
established.  It is envisaged subject to sourcing
additional funding, that a pilot plant will be
established with an initial run rate of 300,000t or
ore per annum.  The full production plant will be
significantly higher than this at approx. 3mt of ore
being processed.  
Exploration Work Update
The latest drilling and analysis work clarified the
geological structure of the Drozhilovskoye field and
confirmed that the tungsten and molybdenum
minerals are isolated, and that they can be
selectively mined. The work also confirmed the
presence of significant amounts of high quality
lithium. The work undertaken by the Company
internally has allowed a re-estimation of the
contained metal content of both molybdenum and
tungsten resources and provides a first estimate for
the lithium resource (all with a cut-off grade of
0.05%). The drilling consisted of number of bore
holes, totaling 534 metres and 417 samples were
taken for analytical review.  Please refer to the
Company’s RNS dated 19 March 2018 for further
information.
Further development of the asset
The Company’s lead specialists recently visited
Chinese research institutes to familiarise themselves
with the technology and discuss the detailed
procedures for processing molybdenum, tungsten
and lithium ores, and to deliver a presentation on
Kemin. 
The trip also involved a visit to an operating plant
for the beneficiation of molybdenum, tungsten and
lithium ores with the end product being flotation
concentrates of three different types of metal, i.e.
molybdenum, tungsten and lithium. The deposits
of the Drozhilovskoye field are regarded by
management to be very similar to the ores being
processed at that plant. 
This plant visited is owned by China Molybdenum,
which is the largest molybdenum mining company
in China. During the meeting, China Molybdenum
showed interest in the Drozhilovskoye field and
discussions were held in relation to a possible joint
development of the field. These initial discussions
centered on development via open pit mining, and
situation of the production complex close to good
rail links and power supplies.  This, together with
the presence of lithium, and other minerals,
indicated from the test drilling conducted, makes
the development of the field attractive to a partner,
and further discussions are planned to take place.
The following work needs to be carried out to
transition to the production phase:
 Completion of a mineral block model and
resource estimation.  As part of the process of
moving to the next stage of development the
Company will instruct a Competent Persons
Report in accordance with the JORC code, for
both sites.;
 Approval of the reserves by the Kazakh
authorities;
 Further geological exploration through drilling
confirmatory boreholes and taking further
samples for process testing and determining an
efficient technology for the extraction of
molybdenum, tungsten and lithium;
 Subject to sourcing additional funding, the
process testing will be followed by construction
of a pilot beneficiation plant with a proposed
processing capacity of 300kt per year, and which
will produce a concentrate of molybdenite,
tungsten and a concentrate of lithium;
 Completion of a feasibility study to confirm all
technical and financial results including using
the design of the pilot beneficiation plant to
develop, subject to sourcing additional funding.
A beneficiation plant with ore processing
capacity of 3.0mt per year.  Funding
Funding requirements are being assessed to
determine what additional funding is required in
the first instance in relation to the construction of
the pilot plant.
The costs of the work programs for both sites totals
approximately £2.3m for the two year licence
period.   
The Company has sufficient cash resources
available under its current facility arrangements
with Amrita (£4.5million of which is still available for
drawdown) to perform the work programmes as
currently specified.  However dependent on future
plans and in particular the setting up and operation
of a pilot plant, further funds may be raised
through equity/debt finance. During this
non-productive phase the Company will maintain a
tight control of costs in order to maintain cash
resources.  
In relation to development funding to move to the
production stage, the Company is currently
exploring and developing plans to obtain further
lines of funding, once a firmer budgeted cost of
developing the pilot plant, and production
techniques are refined. 
Summary
The Company is in advanced talks with interested
parties who have been encouraged by the recent
drill results.  The expectation is that an agreement
will be reached to progress the development of the
sites, with the aim to move towards production in
the near future initially on a pilot plant basis
Financial performance review
The consolidated loss attributable to Kemin
shareholders in the twelve months ended
31 December 2017 was £463,000 (FY 2016:
£432,000). The overall loss including that
attributable to minority shareholders was £484,000
(2016:£445,000).  The costs of servicing the debt
and administrative costs of the Group were in line
with expectations.  Of the loss £356,000 is
attributable to the head office, being administrative
costs of which the majority relates to maintaining
the professional fees and associated fees for
maintaining the London listing on the London
Stock Exchange. In addition certain costs are
incurred in supporting the administrative function
in Kazakhstan.  They have been maintained at
competitive levels. 
The other principal expense relates to finance
charges which total £287,000, (2016 £287,000). The
interest accrued on the loan in the current year has
been capitalised against the loan balance.  
As in the prior year the cash spend is kept to a
minimum at present with a limited capital
expenditure programme.  The principal cash
expenses have related to servicing the head office
administrative function, interest charges and loan
repayments have been deferred until cash
resources allow them to be repaid. It is the
intention to move forward with sample testing with
the aim of raising the necessary funds to develop
the pilot plant in the near term.
Support is still being obtained from the principal
shareholder via Amrita Investments Ltd. The current
cash balances and availability of further draw
downs (£4.5million left to drawdown) on the
Amrita loan facility if required, provides sufficient
funds for the company to continue to meet its
current obligations.
Cost control
Overall costs have been maintained in line
with the prior year. The Company is currently
developing its longer term plans of
development.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks exposed to the Company are:
 availability of future funding outside of the
Amrita facility;
 political and economic environment;
 fluctuation in commodity prices;
 financial risk;
 the resource differing in grade and quantity to
that predicted by feasibility studies; and
 fluctuations in exchange rates resulting from
changes in the value of the Kazakh Tenge.

Mitigation of risks and uncertainties
The Company’s management has analysed the risks
and uncertainties and monitors the risks as far as it
is practical do so given the early development of
the Company.
Certain factors are beyond the control of the
Company such as the fluctuations in the price of
the commodities . However the Group is aware of
these factors and tries to mitigate them as far as
possible. The plan is to move forward with test
production to encompass the production of
Lithium in the overall plan, which increases the
economics of the overall project. 
The Company cannot control the political and
economic environment of the country in which the
resources are based. However, to minimise the risk,
Kemin maintains close relationships with the
Kazakhstan authorities in order to minimise
bureaucratic delays and problems.
In the future as funds are required in order to move
to the next stage of development it is the
Company’s aim is to fix interest rates, where
possible, with the preferred option being to raise
funds via equity. As stated the Company has
sufficient working capital facilities at present to
meet its current cash flow requirements.
The Company has used independent consultants
experienced in resource reports, of the type
required by the Group, to mitigate as far as possible
any material changes in the resource estimates.
Key performance indicators
Given the stage of development of the Company,
the key performance indicators used by the
management for monitoring progress and strategic
objectives for the business are set out below:
The change in the value of the exploration
expenditure is due principally to the effect of the
change in valuation of the Kazakh Tenge against
Sterling.
The key statistic is the level of resources which has
been measured under the GKZ classification, and
will be updated shortly under JORC (2012) by an
independent consultancy once the additional
exploration and evaluation work is completed.
Given the stage of development of the Group, it
has a low number of employees who are
concentrated in the head office. Details of the
Group policy on employees are given on page 9.
