Annual Report for the year ended 30 April 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Group continues to develop its three operating divisions on its multi-jurisdictional platform. The Group sees considerable 
opportunities to expand delivery of its core offerings through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisition. 
The recent listing on The International Stock Exchange (“TISE”) represents a considerable step forward for the Group.
Culture
The Group has taken a commercial and enterprising 
approach to its development and it is extremely mindful of 
the importance of compliance and regulation. Effective risk 
management and regulatory compliance are essential in 
today’s climate as regulatory and reporting regimes across 
the world continue to develop.
The Board sees significant opportunity for the Group to take 
advantage of the operational platform it has created over 
the last three years since the merger of Praxis and IFM whilst 
maintaining a considered and risk conscious approach to 
growth.
With a highly qualified and professional staff base, the Board 
considers that the Group is well placed for a business climate 
of increasing regulation, transparency and enhanced 
reporting requirements.
Strategy
The Group continues to develop its professional approach to 
existing business, risk management, client take-on, business 
development and acquisitions.
The Group has integrated several acquisitions over the 
last few years and continues to grow via a combination of 
organic growth and value-accretive acquisitions that help to 
diversify its jurisdictional reach and service offerings.
The senior management team has a pragmatic and 
considered evaluation method for acquisitions that 
continues to deliver significant stakeholder value. The Board 
plays an active role in the process and is of the opinion that 
the direction being taken continues to be effective.
The Group is majority owned by management. This ensures 
alignment of interest with external shareholders. The Board 
actively seeks to widen share ownership amongst employees 
through share option and buy-as-you-earn schemes.
Governance
The Board considers effective governance to be at the heart 
of good business management and has performed a full 
review of the governance regime and mechanisms within 
the Group.
The Group’s approach is set out within this report and 
focusses on ensuring that the process the Group follows to 
make key business decisions allows for careful consideration 
of the impact those decisions have on the wider stakeholder 
group.
The mechanisms and approach taken comply with the 
Finance Sector Code of Corporate Governance issued by 
the Guernsey Financial Service Commission and have been 
developed with UK Corporate Governance Code in mind.
Board Composition
The Board is made up of two non executive directors and 
the Chief Executive Officer. During this period of significant 
growth the Group needs to remain flexible whilst ensuring 
effective governance and considered decision making.
Board members have been carefully selected for their 
experience in similar environments to that in which the 
Group currently operates and to assist with delivery of the 
Group’s growth strategy.
