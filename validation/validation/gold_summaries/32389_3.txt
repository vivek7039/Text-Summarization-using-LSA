Chairman’s Statement
Overview 
I am pleased to introduce Xafinity’s 2017 
Annual Report and present my first statement 
as Chairman, having been appointed to lead 
the new Board shortly before the Company’s 
listing on the London Main Market in February 
this year. Our successful listing in an IPO 
market dampened by concerns over Brexit was 
testament to Xafinity’s quality of earnings and 
growth potential, with the Offer at 139p per 
ordinary share being fully subscribed by a 
shareholder base of longer-term investors.
The Group achieved a creditable performance 
for the year ended 31 March 2017, continuing 
a strong track record of delivering revenue 
growth, healthy operating margin and strong 
cash generation, while investing in its 
operational capabilities to underpin future 
growth. Strategic Report

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
our colleagues across Xafinity for their 
contribution to meeting the business 
challenges in a significant year of innovation, 
growth and change.
Dividend Policy
The Board are proposing a final dividend of 
0.73p per share, effectively a post-listing 
dividend for the period from Market 
admission to 31 March 2017. This final 
dividend will be payable on 28 September 
2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 1 September 2017.
The Board intend to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy, with a two-thirds/
one-third approximate split of the total 
annual dividend for the final and interim 
dividends respectively and, subject to 
prudent financial discipline and future 
Group results, expect to pay as dividends 
each year up to 67 per cent of adjusted 
profits after tax.
Strategy and Culture 
Xafinity combines expertise, insight and 
technology to address the needs of pension 
scheme clients. The Company has a clear 
strategic vision and goals for organic revenue 
growth, a sound financial base, high quality 
employees and the capability for scaling its 
business model through appropriate and 
timely investment and market consolidation. 
In particular, the Board’s near-term strategy 
addresses the potential of an increasing 
market for de-risking services to defined 
benefit pension schemes and the optimal use 
in the defined contribution market of 
Xafinity’s leading NPT master trust platform.
Implementing the Board’s strategy for the 
Group is an experienced and dynamic 
management team, with an agile client-facing 
corporate culture which puts the customer at 
the heart of the Xafinity business, aligned 
with colleagues united and motivated to go 
the extra mile in delivering market leading 
solutions to a diversified client base.
I am confident that our business strategy and 
strong management, allied with the can-do 
culture and commitment of our colleagues, 
will advance Xafinity’s client base and the 
services provided, to deliver growing returns 
for our shareholders.
Current Trading and Prospects 
The Group’s performance since 31 March 
2017 has remained in line with the Board’s 
expectations and, notwithstanding the 
prevailing macroeconomic uncertainties, we 
believe Xafinity’s core markets and pipeline of 
business opportunities continue to offer the 
potential for real growth. Management 
remains focused on implementing the strategy 
for market penetration and organic revenue 
growth across the pensions business, resulting 
in a healthy momentum of new client wins 
and commissioning of de-risking projects, and 
the Board remains confident about the future 
prospects of the Group.
I look forward to participating with colleagues 
in the next phase of sustained growth for 
Xafinity.
