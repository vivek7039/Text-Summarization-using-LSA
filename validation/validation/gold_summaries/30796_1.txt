Group Chief Executive’s Statement 
Implementing our strategy for growth
Key points in this section:
 ›  Successfully implementing our 
strategy for organic growth
 › Acquisition of two outstanding 
businesses: Gestra 
and Chromalox
 › Delivering long-term 
sustainable value 
for stakeholders
less likely to be cut in times of recession. 
This “self-generated” element of our 
business, combined with the high proportion 
of sales that derive from end users’ 
maintenance and operating budgets, and 
the wide diversity of the markets we serve, 
both geographically and by industry sector, 
makes our business highly resilient, although 
not immune, to the vagaries of the markets.
Strategy implementation
Four years ago we undertook an extensive 
strategic review and developed our strategy 
for growth, the aim of which is to deliver 
self-generated growth that outperforms our 
markets. We identified six Group strategic 
themes, which help us to do better what we 
already do well:
 − increase direct sales effectiveness through 
sector focus;
 − develop the knowledge and skills of our 
expert sales and service teams;
 − broaden our global presence;
 − leverage R&D investments;
 − optimise supply chain effectiveness; and
 − operate sustainably and help improve our 
customers’ sustainability.
During 2017, notable progress was made in 
the implementation of our strategic priorities, 
which was a significant contributing factor to 
the good financial results and strong organic 
growth achieved during the year:
 − We continued increasing the alignment 
between our direct sales force and our 
target industries of Food & Beverage; 
Healthcare; Pharmaceutical; Oil, Gas 
& Chemical; and OEM customers, 
supported by developments in our R&D 
processes, manufacturing capabilities, 
marketing and training materials. In the 
Spirax-Sarco Steam Specialties division, 
the organic growth rate of these priority 
sectors strongly outpaced the growth 
rate of the other sectors. These priority 
sectors now represent almost 50% of 
the division’ s sales, compared to 40% in 
2014. Also noteworthy, the strategically 
prioritised Controls and Thermal Energy 
Management (TEM) products, which 
represent around 40% of sales and 
are the main constituents of our self-
generated solution sales, are growing at 
a much faster pace than the traditional 
Condensate Management products. 
 − We continued to strengthen the 
knowledge and skills of our sales and 
service teams and to develop our pipeline 
of talent. By the end of the year the 
training materials of the Spirax Sarco 
Academy, which was established in 2016 
to oversee the learning and development 
of the Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties 
division, were available in 16 languages 
and we had rolled out the Academy’ s 
initial programmes to almost 1,100 
customer-facing employees. Building on 
the success of our UK Steam Specialties 
award winning graduate programme, we 
established a Global Group Graduate 
Programme to attract and develop 
talented young engineers.
 − We again expanded our geographical 
reach, with four new operating units 
commencing trading at the start of the 
year: Spirax Sarco East Africa (Kenya), 
Watson-Marlow Indonesia, Watson-
Marlow Thailand and Watson-Marlow 
Vietnam, and established a Spirax 
Sarco direct sales presence in Greece, 
Sri Lanka and Morocco, and in UAE to 
support Watson-Marlow sales expansion 
in the Middle East. In recognition of 
our successful international growth, in 
2017 Watson-Marlow Ltd and BioPure 
T echnology Ltd won a combined Queen’ s 
Award for Enterprise, in the International 
Trade category.
“ Notable progress was made in the implementation 
of our strategic priorities, which was a significant 
contributing factor to the good financial results and 
strong organic growth achieved during the year.”

Introduction
Our Company purpose is to help our 
customers and end users implement 
environmentally-friendly engineered solutions 
for energy savings, process efficiency, 
product quality and improvements in plant 
health, safety and regulatory compliance, 
and to engineer sustainable value for 
stakeholders. We do this through having 
the right products, in the right place, at the 
right time, and an extensive global network 
of over 1,600 expert sales and service 
engineers with the knowledge and skills 
required to understand customers’ difficult 
operational challenges and design bespoke 
engineered solutions to resolve them.
Our direct sales business model is highly 
effective at uncovering opportunities to 
improve customers’ steam systems, 
electrical heating and temperature 
management systems, or fluid path 
processes. As they walk our customers’ 
facilities, our specialist engineers are 
able to identify unrecognised needs. 
The engineered solutions required to meet 
these needs generally have a relatively short 
payback period of around 24 months or 
less and, crucially, are typically paid for out 
of our customers’ operational budgets. 
Purchasing decisions are therefore made at 
operational level from budgets, which are  Strategic Report

 − We made two significant acquisitions, 
Gestra and Chromalox, which increased 
our market share and expanded our 
addressable market and successfully 
integrated the two acquisitions made in 
2016, Aflex and Hiter Controls. 
 − Almost thirty new products were launched 
during 2017. Watson-Marlow launched 
the innovative and award-winning 
Quantum peristaltic bioprocessing pump 
with patented ReNu SU T echnology® 
cartridge, which offers a step change 
in pump technology enabling higher 
downstream process yields with minimum 
pulsation throughout the pressure range. 
Other product launches from Watson-
Marlow include: a patented single-handed 
and tool free sanitary tri-clamp for use in 
the Biopharmaceutical industry, called 
QClamp, from BioPure; the Flexicon 
PF7, a benchtop filling pump for use 
in cleanroom environments; and range 
extensions of the Certa pump, for use in 
the Food & Beverage industry. The Spirax 
Sarco Steam Specialties division launched 
multiple new products including the 
SIMS™ Software energy monitoring 
and targeting solution, which enables 
real-time monitoring and visualisation of 
customers’ steam and thermal energy 
systems. Amongst other new product 
introductions, Chromalox introduced the 
CCX Cast Block Heater, for use in high 
pressure environments; and the CXHXD 
corrosion-resistant, explosion-proof Unit 
Heater, for use in hazardous or challenging 
environments, such as offshore 
drilling platforms.
 − T o further develop the capacity and 
efficiency of our supply chain, we 
accelerated the capital investment 
programmes designed to modernise and 
renew our manufacturing equipment and 
completed the expansion of our state-
of-the-art manufacturing facility in China. 
We also established a new distribution 
hub for the Steam Specialties division in 
Singapore, which is designed to improve 
the efficient distribution of products 
and increase customer service levels 
throughout the Asia Pacific region.
 − The implementation of the Group 
Sustainability Strategy remained a key 
priority and good progress was made 
in a number of areas. During the year 
we increased the number of Health and 
Safety professionals within the business, 
rolled out our Supplier Sustainability Code 
to direct suppliers of our sales companies, 
established a network of community 
engagement champions across the Group 
and launched a Community Engagement 
Award to recognise and raise awareness 
of the activities that are taking place 
across the Group. We also reduced our 
global carbon emissions intensity by 4%.
Acquisitions
Our Group acquisitions strategy outlines our 
key acquisition criteria. Acquisitions should:
 − have the potential to create significant 
shareholder value and either increase 
our addressable market into related 
sectors or expand the capabilities of our 
niche businesses through new skills, 
technologies or geographic coverage;
 − serve customers through a direct sales 
business model;
 − increase sales in our core markets;
 − provide products or services where there 
is a high cost of non-performance to 
the customer;
 − have the potential for geographical or 
technology expansion;
 − have strong maintenance, repair and 
overhaul demand and recurring revenues; 
and
 − be capable of achieving Group margins.
During 2017, a unique opportunity arose to 
acquire two outstanding businesses, Gestra 
and Chromalox. Both companies have long 
and successful histories. Industrial boiler 
controls and steam specialist Gestra 
was founded in Germany in 1902 and 
electrical process heating and temperature 
management solutions provider Chromalox 
was founded in the USA in 1917, with both 
companies bringing distinct opportunities for 
growth and expansion to the Group. 
Gestra’ s strength in a number of product 
areas, such as industrial boiler control 
systems, and end applications, such as the 
German chemical industry, complement the 
Spirax Sarco Steam Specialties division’ s 
product offering and industry reach. With the 
help of the Spirax Sarco global footprint, 
we believe that the combination of the 
two entities will enhance organic growth 
opportunities going forward. 
Chromalox represents an excellent 
opportunity to expand our addressable 
markets through the acquisition of a clearly 
related business that is also dedicated 
to transferring heat energy into industrial 
processes and shares our strong direct 
sales business model. As we invest in 
strengthening Chromalox’ s direct sales 
channels and leverage our global footprint 
and expertise, this acquisition will enhance 
our growth and sustainable value creation for 
customers and shareholders.
Both acquisitions were accretive to Group 
earnings in 2017 and were positively 
received by customers and employees. 
The integration of both businesses into 
the Group has proceeded very positively 
and remains in line with the integration 
plans reported at the time of their 
respective acquisitions.
Engineering opportunities for 
sustainable value creation
As a socially responsible business, we 
recognise the importance of operating in a 
way that delivers long-term sustainable value 
for all stakeholders. This year we engineered 
opportunities to strengthen the Group’ s basis 
for organic growth; served over 100,000 
direct buying customers, enabling them 
to improve process efficiency and reduce 
their environmental impacts; invested 
extensively in developing the skills and 
capabilities of our employees; developed 
new products; expanded our geographical 
reach; engaged with our local communities 
to help meet their needs; reduced our own 
CO 2 emissions intensity; maintained the 
Group operating margin and delivered the 
50th year of dividend progress, all of which 
has been achieved whilst delivering strong 
organic growth.
