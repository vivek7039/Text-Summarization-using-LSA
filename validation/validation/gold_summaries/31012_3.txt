 Chairman’s statement
A pivotal year 
for TT
Neil Carson
Chairman
2017 has been a pivotal year for TT. The business has performed 
strongly, and the disposal of the Transportation Sensing and Control 
(Transportation) division has realised value for the benefit of TT and 
our shareholders. 
Strategic development
2017 has been a significant year for us, having disposed of the 
Transportation division for £123.2 million in October. Under strong 
leadership, the Transportation division has made significant progress, 
delivering good sales growth and positive operating margins in TT’s 
last year of ownership. The Board believes that this was the right 
time to realise the value for the division, following the turnaround 
in performance. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank the 
Transportation leadership team for their contribution to TT and wish 
them well in their new home with AVX Corporation. Our ability to 
execute major organisational and portfolio change together with 
improved financial capacity positions us well to invest and grow the 
remaining TT Group. 
I have been delighted to see the strong performance of the 
remaining business. TT is a profitable, growing business, with 
excellent cash conversion. Progress has been made on TT’s strategy 
to build leading positions in markets with structural growth drivers 
where there is increasing electronic content. By focusing on areas of 
the market where our industry expertise and focused R&D investment 
is creating differentiated capabilities, we will help our customers solve 
their most complex challenges. I have been particularly pleased 
to see our improved customer focus reflected in a number of new 
contract wins (see page 8 and pages 30–35). The Board believes 
that this, in turn, will create profit growth and will position TT to 
create long-term value for our shareholders. Our strategic focus on 
enhancing our business development, value-added product solutions 
and operational excellence, we believe, are the right areas to take TT 
to the next level.

We have positioned TT for organic growth ahead of the 
market with opportunity to progress our operating margin. 
By prioritising strong cash performance, including targeting 
80%+ cash conversion, we are able to continue to invest in 
R&D to support growth while improving ROIC and maintaining 
a progressive dividend policy. We will continue to support our 
strategy with targeted, complementary acquisitions.
At the start of 2018, we took our first step in deploying our increased 
financial capacity to drive growth for the Group with the recommended 
cash offer for Stadium Group plc (Stadium). You can read more about 
the offer on page 9 and page 81. 
Our people
We are a people business, and the strong business 
performance achieved would not be possible without the hard 
work and commitment of our people across our global operations. 
We have made good progress launching more new products to 
market, enhancing our sales organisation and delivering continuous 
operational improvement. Importantly, we have had another year 
of progress in our safety performance. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank all of our employees who have contributed 
to another successful year in 2017. 
Shareholder returns and dividend
We have delivered a strong business performance across the 
Group. We are growing, our operating margin is up and our cash 
performance has been excellent. Our strategy is progressing well, 
and while there remains more to be done, the performance to date 
is reflected in the strengthened position of the Group. 
Given TT’s financial performance, strategic progress and growth 
prospects for the business, the Board is recommending increasing 
the final dividend to 4.05 pence per share. This, when combined 
with the interim dividend of 1.75 pence per share, gives an 
increased total dividend of 5.8 pence per share for the full year 
(2016: 5.6 pence per share).
Looking forward
TT is now a different business. Our strategic focus combined with 
our increased financial capacity to invest in our proven strategy will 
position TT well to capitalise on the proliferation of electronics in 
our markets. The Board is confident of strong progress in 2018.
