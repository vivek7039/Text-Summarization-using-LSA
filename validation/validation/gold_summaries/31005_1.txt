I am pleased to report that we have delivered solid growth in 
Underlying profitability in 2017, with the strong growth in ENA profits 
more than offsetting the softer but stable ARW profits. 
The strong growth in ENA Underlying profitability was underpinned 
by further organic growth, particularly in our SBR business, the 
benefits of our focused M&A activity and the associated synergies in 
2016 and 2017, and the depreciation in Sterling which favourably 
impacted our first half results. ARW Underlying profitability has been 
resilient, and performed in line with expectations, with Nitrile latex 
margins broadly stable throughout 2017 at similar levels to the last 
quarter of 2016. Positively, and as guided at the start of 2017, the 
overall Underlying profitability of the Group has moved forward in 
2017 with the combination of underlying organic growth, M&A 
activity and favourable currency impact more than compensating 
for the expected softer Nitrile latex margins. 
Underlying profit before tax increased by 6.4% from £122.2m 
to £130.0m. This reflected a 25.5% increase in ENA Underlying 
operating profits, up from £93.3m to £117.1m and a decrease in ARW 
Underlying operating profits, lower at £35.1m from £48.7m. The rise in 
ENA Underlying profits reflected strong organic growth (£16.0m), 
including a first full year contribution from PAC (Dispersions), the 2017 
acquisition of Speciality Additives (£3.7m) and favourable foreign 
currency translation impact (£4.1m). The reduction in ARW Underlying 
profits principally related to the expected softening in Nitrile latex 
margins seen in the last quarter of 2016, albeit reassuringly the 
margins broadly held firm at this level throughout 2017. 
IFRS profit before tax decreased by 36.8% from £136.7m in 2016 
to £86.4m in 2017, reflecting the inclusion in 2016 of large gains 
on Malaysian land sales (£33.2m) and disposal of our South African 
business (£4.7m), and the foreign currency hedge gain associated 
with the PAC (Dispersions) acquisition purchase price (£13.1m).
Cash generated from operations increased to £162.6m (2016: 
£157.0m) and the cash flows were again strong with good 
conversion of EBITDA to cash. The cash performance of the 
business over the year meant that the Group’s leverage at the year 
end was 1 times net debt:EBITDA. Capital spend increased to a 
record £60.3m in line with guidance and our stated strategy to 
invest in our principal sites. We also invested in our inorganic growth 
strategy with the acquisition of Speciality Additives, our second 
bolt-on acquisition, for £66.1m, and completion of our third bolt-on 
acquisition which took place after the year end on 31 January 2018 
for a further £25.7m. Our strong balance sheet continues to give us 
options for both organic and inorganic investment opportunities to 
support future growth.

Chief Executive Officer Safety, health and environment 
In 2017 we had the best ever recordable injury rate, which was 
reduced by 56% relative to 2016, and we are reassured to see 
positive movement in our other SHE key performance measures. 
Whilst we are pleased with the marked improvement, this is a 
consequence of daily attention and vigilance in our working 
practices and processes, and we recognise that there is no place 
for complacency in this regard. The high standards set by the Group 
in relation to safety, health and environment are complemented by 
the significant investment we continue to make, and our Group SHE 
team monitor the Group’s adherence to our standards and report on 
our performance against those standards at each Executive team 
and Board meeting. 
The Group built on the strong platform of safety standards put in 
place in the prior year by embedding the SHE Principles and 10 
Golden Rules in our operations as well as focusing on eliminating 
the opportunity for work to be carried out in an unsafe way or unsafe 
environment. A rolling programme of Process Hazard Assessment 
Revalidation has been completed on all our high risk sites and 
prioritised action plans are being implemented to address identified 
gaps. This programme will be expanded to all sites in 2018. 
Strong progress has been made in our commitment to the 
environment with a 10% reduction in VOC emissions through 
making operational changes in our sites, particularly the UK. 
With the M&A activity adding new sites to our network, we are in 
the process of setting new targets for all our environmental key 
performance indicators.
Innovation 
In 2017, sales of new products launched in the last five years was 
again 20%, in line with 2016 and meeting our stated target. We are 
excited at the launch of more new products in 2017 with the major 
launch being our new and patented Nitrile latex, SyNovus
®
. The new 
product launch of SyNovus
®
 represented a further milestone for our 
innovation team in Malaysia, reducing the development time from 
inception to commercialisation, including patenting the proprietary 
technology, to just 18 months. The shortened innovation process, 
representing a reduction of almost 50% on previous new product 
developments, is a testament to the dedication, skill and expertise 
of our in-house R&D team.
This patented product delivers significant value to both our 
customers and the end user markets as the SyNovus
®
 formulation 
significantly reduces the required operating temperature of glove 
manufacturing lines, reducing both energy costs and the associated 
environmental impact. It also reduces maturation time thus enabling 
glove manufacturing lines to run at higher throughput providing 
manufacturers with increased capacity without capital expenditure, 
and additionally eliminates certain additives introduced to Nitrile 
latex formulations reducing the risk of potential allergic reactions 
with end users.
These benefits, coupled with superior tensile strength, improved 
colour and reduced odour resulted in a positive, well-received 
product launch in Kuala Lumpur with over 150 glove manufacturing 
leaders and guests in attendance.
M&A integration
With three acquisitions, PAC (Dispersions), Speciality Additives 
and BASF Pischelsdorf, over the last two years, and ongoing 
discussions in relation to transformational and further bolt-on 
acquisitions, our ability to successfully integrate is crucial to 
capturing value. We are pleased with the progress made in the 
integration of PAC (Dispersions) and Speciality Additives and are 
already implementing a detailed plan for the BASF Pischelsdorf 
acquisition. The integration of PAC (Dispersions) is substantially 
complete with the final two major actions initiated in 2017, the sale of 
the Leuna (Germany) site and the announcement of the restructuring 
of Ribécourt (France) site. We are on target to deliver the run rate 
synergies of $12m by the end of 2018, with a further $2m run rates 
savings to be delivered in 2019. 
Delivering organic growth
The largest capital investment programme in the Group’s history is 
well underway. This will help to maintain and upgrade our current 
asset base and respond to market demand for our products. This 
programme commenced in 2016 and we spent £60.3m in 2017 
across the Group. Our Project Excellence approach has been 
introduced Group-wide and aims to ensure that all of the projects 
are completed safely, on time and within budget.
Given the global mega-trends of urbanisation, aging demographics, 
evolving middle class, increasing mobility and the ever more stringent 
environmental legislation, there is increasing demand from the market 
for more of our speciality chemicals and for enhancements to our 
product portfolio, and we have invested accordingly with capacity 
as well as capability expansions in a number of our sites.
• Nitrile latex: 90ktes expansion of our Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) 
site due for completion in late 2018 with a further expansion in 
an advanced stage of planning to address a market which is 
growing at 8% to 10% per annum.
• Dispersions: 36ktes capacity of made-to-order speciality acrylic 
lines in Worms (Germany) and a 9ktes increase in acrylic capacity 
in Roebuck (USA) scheduled to be complete in early 2019.
• SBR latex: Enhancement to our Marl (Germany) site to improve 
output levels to take advantage of opportunities in the Foam 
Market and an upgrading of our Oulu (Finland) site to move from 
supplying the declining graphic paper market to the growth 
markets of speciality paper and packaging.
We continue to invest in the organisational structure and, over 
the last 3 years, have established teams in Operational and 
Manufacturing Excellence, Business Development and Specialist 
Feedstock Procurement. In 2018 the programmes will be further 
enhanced by the introduction of our Commercial Excellence 
programme to our commercial organisation, designed to ensure 
we work more closely with our customers in generating value.
Delivering M&A growth 
Growth through acquisitions is a key part of our growth strategy. 
We are highly active in targeting and reviewing speciality chemical 
acquisition opportunities. These will include both bolt-on 
acquisitions, similar to the ones we have completed, and more 
transformational step-change strategic transactions in adjacent 
chemistries. Our experienced M&A and due diligence teams will 
be opportunistic but disciplined in their approach to acquisitions.
We have made three speciality chemical company acquisitions in 
the last two years, all bolt-on acquisitions complementing our 
existing businesses, and have reviewed many other opportunities 
that have not resulted in completed acquisitions. Whilst we remain 
highly active in M&A processes, we have a clear focus on what 
constitutes an attractive acquisition target, what price we are 
prepared to pay and a firm commitment to incisive due diligence. 
We will remain resolute and disciplined in pursuing only the right 
value-enhancing opportunities.
Outlook
Looking forward, whilst acknowledging the ongoing challenges 
in our Nitrile latex and constructions and coatings Dispersions 
markets, we are confident of making further solid progress in 2018, 
underpinned by underlying growth in both segments, and from 
integrating our recent acquisitions. 
With our significant organic investment in new capacity being 
commissioned in late 2018, we remain confident in continuing to 
deliver growth in profitability and driving further value for 
shareholders in future years.
