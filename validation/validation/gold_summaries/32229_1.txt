Chief Executive’s Report
For the year ended 31 March 2017
Tim Woolley
Chief Executive Officer and Founder
Our Chairman referred in his Statement to the fact that last year was a disappointing year for active managers and that 
indeed many of our funds failed to beat their benchmarks. Whilst disappointing one should never read too much into a 
single year – our history has shown that backing a good active manager over the long-term delivers better returns net  
of all costs than betting on a passive benchmark product.
Many clients would agree that the US market is regarded as the most efficient and most difficult in which to beat 
the benchmark, yet if you had invested $10,000 in our North America UCITS fund over 1, 3, 5 years or since launch, 
your returns would be comfortably ahead of the benchmark return net of all costs in every one of those periods, as 
indicated below.

On the absolute return side we have also achieved some 
impressive returns particularly on our two absolute UCITS 
products GCB and UK Absolute over recent years. The 
GCB fund was launched in September 2013 and has 
delivered a return of 19.50% against an index return of 
11.49% and carries an attractive ongoing yield for clients, 
4.2% as at the end of April 2017.
The UK Absolute fund is turning into a star performer 
up 58% since the launch in September 2014 and one 
of the very few UK funds to be up over Brexit. The 
performance has not gone unnoticed and the fund size 
is now over £150m which should increase further once 
the crucial three year anniversary is reached, assuming 
performance is maintained.
We are justifiably proud of the above record and it 
demonstrates our commitment to being investment 
rather than marketing led in the teams we attract and  
the funds we launch. The simple lesson would seem to 
be that clients should back all our funds at launch and  
sit back and enjoy the long-term ride! 
I am excited at the prospect of handing over leadership 
of the Company to Gavin Rochussen over the coming 
weeks. His record of success at J O Hambro was 
exceptional and we are delighted that he has chosen 
Polar for the next chapter in his career.
Gavin’s success at J O Hambro was built around the 
same philosophy and values that we have at Polar and 
this together with his record of execution gives me great 
encouragement for the future of the Company. The 
focus will continue to be investment led with high alpha 
differentiated active product serving the needs of our 
clients, with capacity limits on funds appropriate to the 
underlying liquidity of the strategy.
There are undoubtedly challenges ahead for us as a 
Company and the industry in general but I believe 
significant opportunities too especially if one looks 
beyond the UK to the global wealth management 
industry. Gavin’s arrival is timely in that respect given 
his expertise in overseas business development and this 
will no doubt play a key role in our future growth in the 
coming years.
I would like to thank our many loyal clients and 
shareholders for their support during my tenure as CEO 
and to thank all our talented and dedicated employees 
who have delivered so much during the last seven and 
half of years. 
Whilst my involvement in the day-to-day operations 
of Polar is coming to an end I am very much looking 
forward to my continued association with the Company 
as non-executive Board member and major shareholder.
