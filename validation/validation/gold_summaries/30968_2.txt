 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
In relation to the Annual Report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report 
and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and Company financial 
statements for each financial year. The 
Directors are required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange to prepare 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and have elected 
under company law to prepare the Company 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU.
The Group financial statements are 
required by law and IFRS adopted by the 
EU to present fairly the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and the 
financial performance of the Group. The 
Companies Act 2006 provides in relation 
to such financial statements that references 
in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view 
are references to their achieving a 
fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group and the Company for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and 
Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
a.  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
b.  make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
c.  state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs adopted 
by the EU; and
d.  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
4D pharma plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
