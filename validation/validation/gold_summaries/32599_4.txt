 At a Glance
Our vision is to become the UK’s 
market-leading, non-standard credit 
company, with our customers at the 
very heart of our business. 
As an established, relationship-driven 
consumer finance provider, we focus 
on responsible lending and fair, helpful 
service to meet the needs of customers 
with complex credit histories throughout 
the UK.
What We Do
Our customers are usually ineligible 
for credit from mainstream lenders. 
By offering small, affordable loans of 
up to £1,000, either in cash or on a 
Morses Club Card, we proudly provide 
our customers with an essential service.
The Group is currently in the process of 
obtaining its full regulatory permissions 
with the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) and continues to operate 
under interim permissions. We operate 
primarily via a network of self-employed 
agents from the same communities as 
their customers. Loans are finalised in 
person by a Morses Club agent who 
then collects the repayments each 
week. These personal connections allow 
us to know our customers and their 
needs, developing strong relationships 
that often endure for many years. 
Treating Customers Fairly
We are a responsible lender and our 
commitment to fair customer treatment 
is woven throughout our business. 
In independent satisfaction surveys, 
over 95% of both employees and agents 
said they understood the importance 
of treating customers fairly.
Every time a customer borrows from 
us, their agent conducts an affordability 
check with them in person, helping 
to ensure good customer outcomes. 
We make our rates clear and never 
charge missed or late payment fees  
or interest. Our customer-centric 
approach to lending helps to keep  
our customer satisfaction scores 
consistently high.
