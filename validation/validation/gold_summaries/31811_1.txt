 CEO’s statement
Clive Dix, Chief Executive Officer
This has been an important year 
for C4XD in implementing our 
vision as we have progressed our 
pipeline towards commercialisation, 
replenished our pipeline with new 
discovery programmes and raised 
the capital required to support 
our strategy.
Commercialisation
During the fundraise in March 2017 we 
stated that we fully expected to complete 
our first commercial deal within 12 months 
of that date. We believe and understand 
that this is a crucial element of successful 
implementation of our business model. 
We continue to believe that this important 
milestone will be met.
Our lead programme, Orexin-1, aims to treat 
addiction by targeting the “craving” process 
itself and, therefore, can be applied across 
a broad range of substance disorders. We 
have continued to build our pre-clinical data 
package, including the recent presentation of 
data at Neuroscience 2017 in Washington, DC.
We have seen high levels of pre-clinical 
partnering interest and have entered into 
late stage commercial discussions.
Forming strategic alliances
Last year we announced we would no longer 
continue providing any fee-for-service 
capabilities choosing instead to seek 
longer-term risk-sharing strategic alliances.
In September 2016 we entered a 
new multi-target, risk-sharing strategic 
collaboration with Evotec AG (“Evotec”), 
a leading drug discovery and development 
alliance company. This deal enables us to 
increase the output of our engine whilst 
reducing risk and cost.
Alongside our own proprietary suite of 
cutting-edge technologies, the alliance with 
Evotec will expand our ability to generate 
commercially attractive pre-clinical assets 
to meet the pharmaceutical industry’s 
increasing demand for high quality, early 
stage drug candidates.
We will continue to seek similar, 
value-adding alliances. 
Successful fundraises
In September 2016, we completed a 
£5 million fundraise at 102 pence per 
share bringing in several new investors, 
including Calculus Capital Limited and 
Polar Capital LLP .
In March 2017 we completed a £7.0 million 
fundraise at 85 pence per share bringing 
in several new investors including Legal 
& General and Hargreave Hale which have 
strong track records in investing in the life 
science sector. This new cash enables us 
to progress and add to our pre-clinical 
pipeline and provides working capital 
for operations.
Building our discovery portfolio
We are constantly building our portfolio 
and will continue to invest into C4XD’ s 
core discovery activities in order to 
support our ambitions. 
Over the past 12 months, key drug 
discovery programmes in addiction 
and inflammation have advanced and our 
Taxonomy3
®
 DNA-based target discovery 
technology continues to produce novel 
target data in a number of commercially 
valuable disease areas. These targets can 
be addressed through our drug design 
platform including our Conformetrix 
and MolPlex chemistry technologies.
Critically, robust scientific and commercial 
intelligence gathering continues to drive 
selection criteria for inclusion in our portfolio.
Outlook
C4XD’ s strategy is delivering value for 
our shareholders and positioning us well 
to achieve our ambitions in drug discovery. 
The next year will continue to focus on 
securing deal revenue from the commercial 
discussions initiated this year, progressing 
our discovery candidates to pre-clinical 
development and commercialisation 
and continuing to replenish and build the 
pipeline by identifying novel and exciting 
drug targets. I am excited about what we 
can achieve, and I look forward to sharing 
this journey with you.
We have a complete range 
of tools to discover novel 
compounds and pioneer 
new disruptive approaches 
to drug discovery.

Neuroscience – addiction 
and neurodegeneration
Oral Orexin-1 Receptor 
Antagonist Programme
Our most advanced drug discovery 
programme aims to provide a novel oral 
medicine for addiction/substance use 
disorders, a substantial area of unmet 
medical need forecast to be worth an 
estimated $13 billion per annum by 2018
1
. 
Our pre-clinical candidate molecule, an 
oral selective Orexin-1 receptor antagonist, 
remains on schedule to be ready for clinical 
development by the end of 2017. Following 
completion of a successful 4.2Kg GMP 
manufacturing campaign of drug substance, 
the in-life phase of the pivotal GLP toxicology 
studies have been completed with the 
subsequent pathological analysis in 
progress. The pre-clinical profile of this 
candidate was recently presented at the 
annual conference organised by the Society 
for Neuroscience in Washington, DC, in 
November and was well received. This 
was the first scientific presentation of our 
candidate highlighting its strong efficacy in 
pre-clinical models of nicotine addiction. 
The Orexin-1 receptor is considered to be 
central to the brain’ s “craving” and “reward” 
pathways with pre-clinical efficacy observed 
in multiple addiction models. In a recently 
conducted pre-clinical pilot study, C4XD’ s 
candidate attenuated cocaine-induced brain 
dopamine elevation supporting its potential 
in this important therapeutic area and 
adding to the compelling pre-clinical data 
already achieved in nicotine addiction. 
The most advanced Orexin-1 antagonist 
currently in development was discovered 
by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd (“Actelion”) 
and following the acquisition of this company 
by Johnson & Johnson in 2017 for its 
advanced clinical portfolio is now being 
developed by Idorsia Ltd. Recently , the 
Orexin-1 pathway has also been strongly 
linked with the treatment of anxiety and 
it appears that this may be the focus 
of Idorsia’ s programme. Idorsia has 
completed the Phase 1 clinical study 
with this molecule in 2017 but not yet 
announced a Phase 2 study and so C4XD’ s 
programme remains very attractive and 
competitive. As a result, and in line with 
our stated goal, late stage commercial 
discussions are underway.
Parkinson’s disease (“PD”)
T owards the end of 2016, we completed 
our analysis on a publicly available PD 
dataset from the UK (Wellcome T rust) using 
C4XD’s proprietary target discovery 
technology T axonomy3
®
. This identified 
multiple novel disease associated genes 
in discrete patient sub-groups that could 
potentially provide an opportunity in 
stratified medicine. During 2017, we have 
extended our initial exciting results on 
understanding the genetic basis of this 
disorder and confirmed these discrete 
patient sub-groups. Using a US dataset, 
we have now found an additional 67 
genetic variants not previously associated 
with PD, complementing the 47 novel 
genetic variants identified in our initial study . 
The identification of these new genetic 
associations further confirms the power 
of T axonomy3
®
 to generate novel genetic 
insights into disease. T o put these findings 
into context, at the start of 2017 only 
40 PD associated genes were known in 
the scientific literature, and in September , 
Genentech and 23andme published the 
results of their collaboration in the scientific 
journal Nature Genetics (Nature Genetics 
49, 1511–1516, 2017), which identified 
a further 17 novel genetic associations.
Informatic analysis of proprietary genes 
discovered with T axonomy3
®
, together 
with known genetic susceptibility genes, 
has flagged new pathways relevant to the 
disease aetiology: identification of such 
disease-relevant pathways is a pivotal step 
in drug discovery. We are now selecting 
the optimum drug targets from the genes 
we have discovered that map to these 
pathways, to progress these targets 
to drug discovery programmes.
Alzheimer’s disease
Following the significant genetic 
discoveries in PD using our T axonomy3
®
 
platform we initiated analysis of an 
Alzheimer’ s disease dataset in 2017 which 
is now starting to deliver its preliminary 
results. Excitingly, as observed with the 
PD dataset we have identified discrete 
patient sub-groups in this disease that 
have not been described previously and 
characterisation of the novel genetic 
associations are underway. 
Oral NRF-2 Activator Programme
C4XD has designed and discovered 
novel potent activators of the NRF-2 
pathway , which is important in mediating 
lung diseases such as chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (“COPD”), pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (“P AH”) and other 
inflammatory diseases. COPD represents 
an area of substantial unmet medical 
need and a $41 billion market
2
 and, 
therefore, oral activators of NRF-2 are 
the subject of considerable interest to 
the pharmaceutical industry . GSK has filed 
several further patents on their molecules 
against this target in the last 12 months and 
is likely to be close to clinical development. 
Recently, C4XD’ s lead compounds have 
been shown to significantly increase 
NRF-2 activation in the lungs in pre-clinical 
studies following oral administration. 
This has previously been a significant 
challenge in this area, demonstrating 
the valuable properties of our molecules 
and highlighting the recent progress made 
in this programme. Studies continue to 
further optimise these molecules to enable 
the selection of a pre-clinical candidate.
Oral IL-17 Inhibitor Programme
As previously reported, our small molecule 
programme against Interleukin-17 (“IL-17”), 
a high value clinically validated target for 
inflammation and autoimmune diseases such 
as psoriasis (estimated to be worth $9 billion 
per annum
3
), has identified small molecules 
that can selectively block IL-17 activity whilst 
keeping the molecular size of the molecule 
in the traditional “drug-like” range. T o 
date, the identification of orally available 
small molecules has proved extremely 
challenging but they are highly sought 
after by the Pharma industry . Recently we 
identified potent compounds suitable for 
oral delivery and these are now the subject 
of in vivo studies. Commercially this is 
critical as current marketed drugs that 
target IL-17 are based on injectable 
C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC

Strategic report monoclonal antibodies so an oral or topical 
treatment would increase the number of 
patients who can access drugs targeting 
this mechanism.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Analysis of a rheumatoid arthritis dataset 
using C4XD’ s proprietary target discovery 
technology T axonomy3
®
 identified 66 
novel genes that have not previously been 
associated with this major disease. Of these, 
nine were prioritised based on corroborative 
biology in the scientific literature and 
druggability . These potential targets are from 
protein families whose function suggests that 
any resulting drug molecules will have a very 
different biological impact on disease from 
that of existing rheumatoid arthritis therapies, 
enabling considerable therapeutic and 
commercial differentiation. T wo of these drug 
targets were nominated for evaluation as 
potential new pipeline programmes and the 
first of these targets has progressed into the 
hit to lead stage of discovery with molecules 
showing activity in a disease-relevant 
cell system.
Opportunistic programmes
Immuno-oncology
C4XD’ s Drug Discovery Engine is currently 
being used to target two key therapeutic 
targets for the treatment of cancer in 
the immuno-oncology space and these 
programmes are at the evaluation stage. 
These programmes are being progressed 
as part of the multi-target risk-sharing 
alliance with Evotec AG (“Evotec”) 
announced in September 2016.
Diabetes
In late 2016, C4XD was awarded a ~£140k 
Biomedical Catalyst feasibility study award 
from InnovateUK to progress hits for the 
GPR142 agonist programme for diabetes. 
T ype-2 diabetes (“T2D”) affects over 420 
million people worldwide, creating an 
enormous healthcare and socio-economic 
burden. The GPR142 receptor has been 
recently reported to be an exciting new 
target for the treatment of T2D with several 
advantages. Firstly , its activation results in 
insulin secretion but only in the presence 
of high blood sugar levels, avoiding the 
life-threatening side effect of low blood 
sugar associated with insulin-based 
therapies. Secondly, GPR142-based 
medicines would be orally administered, 
avoiding compliance issues caused by 
injectable therapies. Lilly is the leader in 
this area and announced it had initiated a 
Phase 1 clinical study with its candidate in 
July 2017. Prosecution of this programme 
has gone well and a lead compound will 
soon be tested in a pre-clinical oral glucose 
tolerance test.
Proprietary technology development
T axonomy3
®
 platform development
In the last year C4XD has significantly 
invested in updating its T axonomy3
®
 
software to enable the goal of being 
capable of analysing six disease datasets 
a year. A new version of the software was 
released in late 2017 which has doubled 
the analysis speed for gene-gene interaction 
analysis via refactoring the CPU code 
architecture. This will also facilitate a move 
to GPU analysis in the future should 
additional computational speed be 
required in the cloud environment.
Conformetrix data platform development 
including VR (virtual reality) visualisation
C4XD’ s novel drug design platform 
“Conformetrix” determines the 3D shapes 
of drug molecules from experimental 
data giving medicinal chemists new and 
unprecedented insights into the behaviour 
and physical properties of drug molecules. 
This enables the rapid design and discovery 
of better and safer drugs for diseases with 
high unmet medical need across broad 
therapeutic areas. During 2017, C4X’ s 
proprietary database of conformational 
3D data surpassed the milestone of 300 
drug molecules providing a rich resource 
for new drug design underpinning our 
unique and differentiated approach. 
One challenge with generating this data 
is that multiple 3D shape information 
is generated for each molecule (a “4D” 
ensemble of these individual 3D shapes) 
and scientific insights for design can be 
obtained from this data by comparing similar 
molecules that have different biological 
activity. Visualising comparisons such as 
these is difficult with current molecular 
software as data of this complexity is 
proprietary to C4XD.
C4XD has initiated the creation of a 
specialised visualiser to allow the viewing 
of C4XD’ s proprietary 4D molecular data 
to provide a revolutionary way of viewing 
and comparing molecules and collaborating 
with multiple users from both a 2D desktop 
environment and in a virtual world utilising 
the latest VR technology. C4XD has 
harnessed the “Unreal Engine” from the 
computer gaming firm Epic Games as a 
technological foundation for this visualiser . 
The choice was made to use this engine 
to provide a cutting-edge render originally 
built for the high-end gaming industry 
but applied to C4XD’ s proprietary data. 
This project has progressed well with 
the first release of this platform recently 
being deployed.
