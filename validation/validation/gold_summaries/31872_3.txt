Wilmington plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2017
06
Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to present my report on 
Wilmington’s results for the twelve months 
ended 30 June 2017. Overall It has been 
a positive financial performance as we 
move towards our objective of becoming 
a single integrated international business. 
Wilmington has continued to meet 
the challenges that necessary change 
inevitably brings; a balance of growing 
revenue and profits whilst making material 
investments in new products, systems, 
offices, personnel and in new businesses. 
Wilmington delivered revenue growth 
of 14% (up 9% on a constant currency) 
led by excellent contributions from the 
acquisitions made during the year and 
supported by organic growth from our 
core offerings. We have seen strong 
growth from Healthcare up 28% and 
good growth from Risk & Compliance up 
9% as well as growth from Professional 
which increased its revenue by 7% albeit 
benefiting from the acquisition of SWAT. 
Adjusted profit before tax (which now 
for the first time includes share based 
payment costs of £0.6m (2016: £0.6m)) 
increased 5% to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m). 
Business strategy
Wilmington’s strategy is to further 
develop its business into a knowledge 
based model and structure focussing on 
serving the needs of chosen communities 
with an overall objective of becoming a 
single integrated international business. 
This business structure will maximise 
Wilmington’s opportunities to help its 
clients and communities meet their 
information, education and networking 
requirements as well as drive operational 
efficiencies. As part of its evolution, 
Wilmington has and is continuing to be 
more focussed on its core communities 
that provide a higher quality of earnings. 
Vision
The vision which acts as our guide and 
underpins our strategy is:
“To be the recognised knowledge leader 
and partner of choice for information, 
education and networking in Risk & 
Compliance, Professional and Healthcare.”
By achieving our vision we aim to turn 
knowledge into competitive advantage for 
our clients. 
“This year has been a positive one for Wilmington, with overall solid 
financial performance delivered in the context of accelerating change 
in our end-markets. Wilmington is well positioned to benefit from this 
change, and we continue to see significant demand for our products 
and services from our customers. 
We enter the new financial year anticipating continued momentum, 
particularly in our Risk & Compliance and Healthcare divisions. 
We are also excited about the prospects for our newly created 
Professional division, which promises to benefit in the medium 
term from the convergence in education requirements across the 
professional services.”

Strategic Report

Project Sixth Gear
On 23 February 2017, we announced 
project Sixth Gear which is the next stage 
in our strategic development. This project 
builds upon the first stage which focussed 
on the simplification of group structure 
and the selective acquisition of businesses 
to fill gaps in our product offerings. 
The prime objective of Sixth Gear is to 
accelerate the move to a single “One 
Wilmington” simplifying and integrating 
the business further, maximising client 
relationships and providing the basis for 
organic and acquisition-led growth and 
scale. The accelerated integration and 
pooling of resources will help to capitalise 
on growing economies of scale.
New Reporting Structure
As previously announced, to help simplify 
Wilmington still further we reorganised 
our business into three divisions; Risk & 
Compliance, Professional and Healthcare. 
The combination of the former divisions of 
Legal and Finance into one new division; 
Professional is a natural outcome from the 
restructuring, downsizing and refocusing 
of our Law for Lawyers business over the 
last few years. This combination which is 
facilitated by the decision to exit from the 
legal practice support market also brings 
greater clarity to this division. 
Risk & Compliance division concentrates 
on servicing the strong organic global 
demand for our offerings supported by 
selective earnings enhancing acquisitions 
in the areas of risk & compliance as well 
as investments in new products, data 
services, offices and in new territories. The 
emphasis continues to be servicing the 
needs of risk managers and compliance 
officers globally. 
Professional division provides information, 
education and networking support 
to professionals in the accountancy, 
financial services, and legal markets. 
This division focuses on supporting the 
post-qualification needs of individual 
professionals and SMEs with an increasing 
emphasis on exploiting international 
opportunities, and an accelerated move 
to expand our digital -learning solutions; 
areas where we feel the revenue growth 
opportunities are greatest. The emphasis 
in the short term will be on organic rather 
than acquisition led growth with capital 
allocated accordingly.
Healthcare division is the renamed Insight 
division recognising that well over 80% of 
its revenue following the HSJ acquisition 
comes from healthcare markets globally. 
We are replicating the successful model 
of providing information (particularly 
insight data and analytics), education and 
networking capabilities on a country by 
country basis. The emphasis will be to 
build on our existing market presence in 
the EU and in the US either organically or 
by acquisition. 
In line with our strategy all three divisions 
offer information, networking and 
education capabilities servicing key 
defined communities, supported by best-
in-class technology. The divisions will look 
to exploit international and, increasingly 
digital opportunities using and replicating 
expertise from their existing market 
positions. Each division will also act as our 
specialist knowledge expert and centre of 
excellence providing expertise and R&D to 
support the two other divisions. 
Our people
As a digital information, education 
and networking business operating in 
dynamic and competitive markets, we are 
fundamentally reliant upon the quality and 
professionalism of our people. I would 
once again like to express my own and 
my fellow Board members’ appreciation 
of the hard work and dedication of our 
Wilmington colleagues across the globe.
Financial and operational 
targets
I am pleased to report progress in all but 
one of our key financial and operational 
targets. We have seen growth in Adjusted 
Profit before Tax, Adjusted Earnings per 
Share, and Return on Equity although 
we saw a drop in the level of Adjusted 
EBITA margins from 20.8% to 19.4% 
reflecting inter alia significant investment 
expenditure during the year. As you will 
read in the Chief Executive Officer’s 
review in our compliance business alone 
we have invested an additional £1.0m 
in new initiatives which represents one 
percentage point off our overall margin. 
We see further necessary operational 
investment during 2017/18 offsetting the 
underlying improvement to margins that 
integration, previous investment projects 
and the impact of higher margin acquired 
businesses bring on our Adjusted EBITA 
margins. The four financial measures 
above form the basis of the Executive 
Directors incentive plans. 
We closely monitor cash conversion which 
we expect to exceed 100% on an annual 
basis, and in 2017 that conversion rate 
was 114% (2016: 108%). This excellent 
cash conversion illustrates the strength 
of the business as well as the efficiency 
in our stewardship of working capital. 
The positive cashflow characteristics 
of Wilmington matched with clear fiscal 
discipline in turn help us attract and 
maintain significant finance from third 
party providers.  25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
We continue to generate a high proportion 
of our revenue derived from quality and 
sustainable income streams and in 2017 
revenue from subscriptions and repeatable 
revenue was 77% of group revenue (2016: 
75%). A high proportion of repeatable 
revenue provides a good degree of 
earnings visibility as well as security. 
We continue to seek to increase each 
year our proportion of revenue generated 
outside the UK where we see good 
prospects for long term sustainable 
growth. Revenue outside the UK has 
grown again and was 43% of total 
revenue compared to 42% last year with 
the underlying relative growth in non-UK 
revenue from our portfolio mitigated by 
our acquisitions this year which were both 
focussed on the UK market. 
These financial and operational 
performances are reflective of the quality 
of our portfolio of offerings which benefit 
from a significant proportion of revenues 
derived from subscriptions and from 
products which disseminate increasingly 
international content-rich, high-value 
information and, increasingly digitally 
along with certificated education and 
compliance programmes.
Acquisitions 
In support of our growth strategy, we 
continue to seek selective earnings 
enhancing acquisition opportunities 
to add additional growth, scale and 
expertise in our chosen markets. In this 
context, we were delighted to announce 
two acquisitions during the year both of 
which were consistent with our strategy 
of acquiring complementary businesses 
with high repeat revenues in our chosen 
knowledge areas and communities. The 
acquisitions of SWAT in July 2016 and 
HSJ in January 2017 enhanced and added 
further scale to our offerings by providing 
information, education and, for HSJ 
networking capability in our Professional 
and Healthcare divisions respectively. 
Cash and borrowings
Net debt, which includes cash and 
cash equivalents, bank loans (excluding 
capitalised facility fees) and bank 
overdrafts, was £40.0m (2016: £34.7m) 
an increase of £5.3m on last year during 
another period of considerable growth 
and change in which we spent £20.3m 
(including deferred consideration) on 
acquisitions offset by the proceeds of 
£7.3m from the disposal of the Underwood 
Street offices. 
The Group continues to demonstrate 
excellent cash generative characteristics 
as mentioned above with consistently 
high levels of cash conversion. These 
characteristics were recognised by the 
continued support from our principal 
bank debt providers who extended the 
multi-currency £65m debt facility on 1 
July 2015 until 1 July 2020. This facility 
was increased to £85m in support of the 
acquisition of HSJ in January 2017. The 
facility can be extended by a further £15m 
to £100m if required with majority lending 
bank consent.
Our ability to use third party debt finance 
remains a key component of our business 
development strategy and our debt 
capacity remains strong. As we increase 
our profits given the cash generative ability 
of our business this combines to provide 
increased capacity for selective earnings 
enhancing acquisitions and other capital 
investments. 
Board changes
Anthony Foye has informed the Board 
of his intention to step down from his 
position as Chief Financial Officer in due 
course. Anthony will remain in his position 
until June 2018 while a successor is 
found and to ensure a smooth and orderly 
handover. The Board will initiate a search 
for his successor and an update in relation 
to a new Chief Financial Officer will be 
made in due course.
Dividend
I am proud of the Group’s record of 
maintaining its dividend over recent 
years and the resumption in 2013/14 of 
a progressive dividend policy reflecting 
our improving financial performance. Our 
dividend payment policy remains the 
same and underpins our confidence in 
the strategy and vision and the resilience 
of our business models. I am pleased 
to confirm that the final dividend for 
this year will be increased again to 4.6p 
(2016: 4.3p) per share, an increase of 
7% on last year. This together with an 
increased interim dividend makes a total 
dividend of 8.5p up 5% from 2016 (8.1p) 
reflective of confidence in our future. It 
is the Board’s intention to maintain its 
progressive dividend policy whilst ensuring 
that suitable dividend cover of at least 
two times adjusted earnings per share is 
maintained. 
The final dividend of 4.6p per share 
will be paid on 17 November 2017 to 
shareholders on the share register as at 
20 October 2017, with an associated ex-
dividend date of 19 October 2017.

Current trading  
and outlook
The first two months of the year have 
started satisfactorily albeit slowly across 
the Group with revenue up 7% against 
the same period last year supported 
by the acquisition of HSJ. In Risk & 
Compliance our compliance training 
businesses which make up the bulk of the 
compliance business have started in line 
with plan although down against a strong 
comparator period in 2016. The sales 
pipeline for compliance training remains 
strong, continuing the momentum we have 
seen over the last few years and in Risk 
we have also seen a good start from Axco 
which was up 6% on the same period in 
2016.
The Professional division has started 
in line with the same period in 2016 
with good early performance from 
Accountancy product lines offsetting 
slightly weaker performances mainly from 
the re positioned Legal product which 
currently includes Ark. Healthcare which 
has the benefit of HSJ has seen good 
growth overall as a consequence of the 
acquisition and that has more than offset a 
slower start across the division. 
Relationships with our chosen 
communities and clients continue 
to evolve at an increasing pace with 
commensurate demand for more 
sophisticated interaction and bespoke 
products and services delivered instantly 
and efficiently. We see this evolution as an 
opportunity to increase our engagement 
with our markets, making us an even 
more essential business partner as well as 
creating barriers to our competitors. We 
need therefore to ensure our businesses 
are equipped with the appropriate extra 
resources, systems and support to 
capitalise on this opportunity. 
The opportunity also comes at a cost 
and we expect to step up our operating 
expenditure in 2017/18 in addition to our 
increased annual London property costs 
of £0.9m by a further £0.75m across the 
business. The additional costs which are 
discussed in the Chief Executives report 
are in people, IT infrastructure, automated 
marketing and in the digitisation of up to 
250 of our training programmes over the 
next 18 months predominantly in the Risk 
& Compliance and Professional divisions 
as part of our digital learning investment.
We continue to see tighter regulatory 
control and more complex legislation 
implemented in most of our key markets 
and we remain confident that these 
changes will continue to drive the demand 
for our products and services globally.
Wilmington has been acquisitive in the 
past and we will continue to review 
opportunities to enhance growth and to 
add expertise through selective earnings 
enhancing acquisitions consistent with 
our strategy. Our priority areas for capital 
allocation remain compliance, risk 
(insurance) and healthcare as we focus on 
adding further scale to our existing market 
positions. 
The Board, our management team and 
our staff are excited and energised about 
the opportunities driving Wilmington in the 
next stage in its development. Wilmington 
will also benefit in 2017/18 from a full year 
of contribution from HSJ as well as the 
impact of the investments made during 
2016/17.
