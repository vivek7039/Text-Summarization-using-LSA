CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT BUSINESS PROFILE AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
I am pleased to report that Booker 
Group has delivered another good 
performance. In the 52 weeks to 24 
March 2017 sales rose by 6.7% to £5.3bn 
and operating profi t rose to £176.1m. 
Customer satisfaction was strong. 
The fi nancial performance was good 
and the Group ended the fi nancial 
year with net cash of £160.7m. Our 
‘Drive’ plans are working well with 
progress on the catering and retail sides 
of the business. Our like-for-like sales to 
caterers were up by 4.4%. Our like-for-like 
sales to retailers declined by 0.6% 
primarily due to tobacco legislation. 
The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business 
are going well. In the 52 weeks to 24 
March 2017 Booker distributed £2.3bn 
of product to our customers’ premises 
versus £1.8bn last year as we continue 
to expand our delivered service. Digital 
sales were £1,072m compared to 
£979m in the previous year and Booker 
India is making progress. 
On 14 September 2015, Budgens and 
Londis joined the Group. They are 
performing well.
Basic earnings per share were 8.66 
pence, up from 7.24 pence last 
year. Given the strong operational 
performance and cash fl ow of the 
business the Board recommends the 
payment of a fi nal dividend of 4.97 
pence per share (2016: 4.03 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim 
dividend, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 5.60 pence per share (2016: 4.60 
pence per share). The fi nal dividend is 
payable on 7 July 2017 to shareholders 
on the register on 9 June 2017.
In addition to the fi nal dividend, the Board 
is recommending a special dividend 
to shareholders of 3.02 pence per 
ordinary share (at a cost of approximately 
£54m, based on the current issued 
share capital of the Group). This follows 
the capital return of 3.20 pence per 
share to shareholders in July 2016 and  
3.50 pence per share in each of July 
2014 and July 2015. 
I should like to thank all our colleagues 
for their contribution to the success of 
the Group in the year just ended.
On 27 January we announced the 
planned merger with Tesco to form 
the UK’s leading food business. 
This combination should improve 
choice, quality, prices and service 
for the UK consumer. It should also 
help the Booker catering, retail and 
small business customer prosper in a 
challenging market. We are continuing 
to assist the UK competition authorities 
in their ongoing consideration of the 
merger and it is expected that the 
merger will complete in late 2017 / early 
2018, subject to, amongst other things, 
the necessary shareholder approvals. 
During this process Booker will ensure it 
is “Business as Usual”. We are excited by 
the opportunities the merger creates for 
consumers, our customers, suppliers, 
colleagues and shareholders.
Outlook
The Group’s revenue in the fi rst seven 
weeks of the current fi nancial year is 
ahead of last year.  
As a result of the proposed merger,  we 
are in an offer period as defi ned in the 
Takeover Code.  We will not be making 
forward looking statements for the 
duration of the offer period.
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 5 July 2017. The notice of Annual 
General Meeting will be issued to 
shareholders in due course.
