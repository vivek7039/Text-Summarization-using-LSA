The backdrop this year was dominated by significant political 
events, including the UK’s EU referendum in June, the US 
presidential election in November and elections in key European 
countries in the second half of the year. However, the uncertainty 
these events created was not reflected in the financial markets, 
which, outside the specific events, displayed low levels of volatility. 
Although annual revenue was split almost equally between the two 
halves of the year, the quarterly performance was more variable. 
A weak first quarter was followed by a record second quarter 
(£133.4 million). The second half of the year also started quietly 
and recovered in the final quarter, with client trading levels peaking 
around the French and German elections.
UK
OTC leveraged revenue in this region grew 0.3% to £223.0 million 
(FY16: £222.3 million) and represented 45% of Group revenues. 
Active client numbers were up by 8% to 64,725 (FY16: 59,940). 
As previously outlined, the UK, due to the large installed client 
base that comes with the most mature market, responds more 
to volatility, both negatively and positively. In the quiet markets, 
this, along with the heavy client acquisition around the UK’s EU 
referendum and the US presidential election, meant that average 
revenue per client was down by 7% to £3,446 (FY16: £3,710).
An annual study of the UK’s retail leveraged trading industry was 
released in July 2017. The survey concluded that, although the retail 
leveraged trading market remains niche, the number of traders 
grew to 148,000 (2016: 138,000 – restated). The survey showed that 
IG’s primary market share of spread bettors fell slightly, from 46% 
to 45%, and its primary share of CFD traders fell from 27% to 24%. 
The measurement of primary market share is based on an estimate 
of the number of primary accounts, excluding partner agreements, 
and makes no allowance for client value. Therefore drawing precise 
conclusions about the share of total market revenue is difficult.
EMEA
OTC leveraged revenue grew 17% to £137.5 million in the  
2017 financial year (FY16: £117.3 million), which equates to 28% of 
the Group revenue. 
Active client numbers rose 10% to 45,903 (FY16: 41,566) and 
revenue per client was up 6% to £2,997 (FY16: £2,821). 
This region divides into two broad areas when analysing 
performance. Like the UK, the EU-based offices are more mature 
and generate a slower rate of growth than the newer, non-EU offices 
of Dubai, South Africa and Switzerland. In the non-EU offices, where 
the regulatory environment appears more stable, revenue almost 
doubled to £30.7 million. Active client numbers were also up in 
these countries by 22%, and revenue per client rose by 59%.
APAC
OTC leveraged revenue in the 2017 financial year grew by 9% to 
£114.1 million, against a prior year of £104.7 million. This was driven 
by a 3% growth in clients to 37,392 (FY16: 36,364) and a 6% rise in 
revenue per client to £3,051. Revenue in the second half of the year 
was 5% ahead of the first half.
US 
Revenue grew 26% over the period to £14.1 million  
(FY16: £11.2 million). Active member numbers were up by 47%  
and revenue per client was down by 14%.
Share dealing and investments 
Share dealing is now active in IG’s two largest markets of the UK and 
Australia, and is also offered in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland 
and the Netherlands. This is an important strategic product line for 
the UK business, which further engages our current client base.
Total client numbers in the year were up around 200% on FY16 
at 20,417 (FY16: 6,748). Revenue and first trades were also up by 
around 200% to £2.4 million and 18,188 respectively. This is partly 
down to ongoing growth in the UK and partly to the launch in 
Australia in July 2016.
The IG Smart Portfolio product was launched in the UK in  
April 2017, in partnership with BlackRock. This product seeks to 
take advantage of the growing market for low-cost passive portfolio 
investment products, and is based on BlackRock ETFs.

Employee remuneration costs 
Fixed employee remuneration costs increased by 15% to £95.5 million (2016: £83.3 million). This reflects an 8% increase in average 
headcount and a 6% increase in average cost per head. The increase in average headcount reflects investment in client-service roles; the 
additional headcount associated with DailyFX; and the dual-running of teams during the process of offshoring functions to the Group’s 
resource hub in Poland. The increase in the average cost per head reflects the introduction of flexible benefits; the impact of salary 
benchmarking and the increase in the GBP equivalent cost of non-UK staff, due to the weakening of GBP compared with most other 
currencies relative to the 2016 financial year. Variable employee remuneration costs reduced by 22%, due to lower discretionary bonus 
payments for staff in the 2017 financial year compared to those made for the prior year.

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
Advertising and marketing costs 
Advertising and marketing costs increased by 30% to £64.5 million 
(2016: £49.7 million). The Group has continued to manage its 
external marketing spend, to drive client recruitment while keeping 
acquisition cost per client flat. The cost per first trade in the 2017 
financial year (excluding Nadex clients, and including irrecoverable 
VAT) was £1,172 (2016: £1,205). 
Depreciation and amortisation 
Depreciation and amortisation increased by £3.7 million to  
£16.4 million (2016: £12.7 million). The increase includes the  
£1.9 million amortisation of the investment in DailyFX, which 
delivers market-leading education, research, analysis and news 
focused on the FX markets, and which is a key part of our future 
marketing strategy. In addition, the charge in the 2017 financial 
year includes £1.6 million relating to the write-down of leasehold 
improvements and fixtures and fittings, as a result of the office 
refurbishment that took place during the year. 
Irrecoverable VAT and other sales taxes
The Group does not recover all of the input VAT and other sales 
taxes it incurs on its costs, and the £14.1 million charge in the 2017 
financial year reflects the amounts not recovered. The increase 
in irrecoverable VAT and sales taxes reflects the increase in costs 
in the year on which VAT and other sales taxes are charged – 
predominantly marketing and advertising costs. 
Regulatory fees
The Group is charged regulatory fees by the various regulators in 
the jurisdictions in which it operates, and in addition is required 
to make a contribution to the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) in the UK. The £3.4 million reduction in the cost 
of regulatory fees reflects the rebate the Group received during 
the 2017 financial year relating to FSCS levies paid in prior years, 
and the benefit from the actual FSCS levy for 2016 which was 
charged in FY16 being lower than the cost accrued. The charge for 
regulatory fees is expected to revert to the normal level in the 2018 
financial year.
Dividend policy
The business continues to be highly cash-generative, and the Board 
seeks to reflect this in the direct cash returns to shareholders. IG has 
a progressive dividend policy, and it remains the Board’s intention 
to pay out, as an ordinary dividend, approximately 70% of Group 
post-tax earnings. Accordingly, the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 22.88 pence per share, giving a full-year dividend 
of 32.3 pence per share, 3% higher than the 31.4 pence per 
share paid for the year to 31 May 2016, reflecting the increase in 
post-tax earnings.
Cash generation, investments and dividends
The Group uses own funds, and net own funds, generated from 
operations as its key measures of cash generation. The make-up of 
own funds is shown on the Balance Sheet in Note A, and the Own 
Funds cash flow is shown in note C of the Other Information section 
in the Financial Statements. 
Cash generation remains strong. Own funds generated from 
operations of £229.2 million (2016: £239.8 million), compares with 
operating profit of £213.4 million (2016: £207.6 million), with a cash 
conversion rate, calculated as own funds generated from operations 
divided by operating profit, of 107% (2016: 116%). The reduction in 
the conversion rate reflects the reduction in year-end bonus accruals 
at 31 May 2017 compared with the prior year-end. The Group 
continues to benefit from a net credit balance in working capital.
Capital expenditure in the year of £17.1 million includes  
£7.6 million relating to the purchase and development of intangible 
assets during the year, including the new web trading platform and 
new financial systems to improve the control environment for cash 
and client money. It also includes £10.5 million on tangible assets, 
including £2.8 million for the office refurbishment in London and 
£6.3 million for new and replacement IT hardware.
During the year the Group purchased the assets of DailyFX, a 
leading global news and research portal, from FXCM Inc. for  
$40.0 million (£32.7 million), with $4.0 million (£3.3 million) of this 
amount deferred for a year. 
Dividend payments to shareholders during the year to 31 May 2017 
of £118.7 million comprise the final dividend for the year to  
31 May 2016 of £84.1 million, as well as the interim dividend for the 
year to 31 May 2017 of £34.6 million.
The final dividend for the year to 31 May 2017 of £83.9 million will, 
if approved, be paid in October 2017.
The Group’s own funds of £614.3 million at the end of the year 
are £26.6 million higher than at the end of the prior year. This 
reflects the £17.8 million own funds cash flow after investments and 
dividends, and £8.8 million of FX translation benefit reflecting the 
increased GBP equivalent value of own funds in non-UK businesses.
Liquidity 
The Group’s total liquid assets at the end of year were  
£731.4 million (2016: £626.7 million). The increase in liquid  
assets reflects the increase in own funds, and the increase in  
client funds on the balance sheet to £117.1 million at 31 May 2017 
from £39.0 million at 31 May 2016. Client funds on the balance  
sheet include £60.0 million (2016: £25.5 million) deposited by 
clients under title transfer arrangements, and £57.1 million  
(2016: £13.5 million) of client deposits with IG Bank SA, the Group’s 
subsidiary in Switzerland. The Group does not currently use any of 
the Swiss Bank deposits for liquidity purposes.
The Group’s primary requirement for liquidity is for the margin it is 
required to deposit with its hedging brokers. The average broker 
margin requirement in the 2017 financial year was £286 million,  
£73 million higher than in the 2016 financial year, with a peak  
broker margin requirement of £367 million during the year.  
At 31 May 2017, the actual broker margin requirement was  
£356 million (2016: £228 million). 
The Group has access to a committed Revolving Credit Facility 
(RCF) of £160 million to assist in liquidity risk management. The 
Group draws down on its RCF during periods when broker margin 
is at elevated levels and in advance of events that could result in 
an elevated broker margin requirement, in order to reduce liquidity 
risk. During the year, draw downs of the facility were made ahead 
of three political events: the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, 
the US presidential elections on 8 November 2016 and the Italian 
referendum on 4 December 2016. These precautionary drawdowns 
were repaid after the event. In June 2017 the Group renewed the 
£160 million RCF with a syndicate of four UK banks. Of the  
£160 million, £60 million is available for three years, with  
£100 million available for 12 months.
Segregated client funds
At 31 May 2017 the Group held £1,215.3 million  
(2016: £917.3 million) of client money in segregated trust bank 
accounts, and £499.8 million (2016: £177.8 million) of client assets 
in third-party custodian accounts. These amounts are segregated 
client money and assets, and are therefore excluded from the 
balance sheet.
Regulatory capital resources
The calculation of the Group’s consolidated capital resources and 
capital ratio is shown in note E of the Other Information section in 
the Financial Statements. The Group’s capital ratio – resources as a 
percentage of the total requirement was 26.7% as at 31 May 2017, 
compared with the minimum ratio for the Group of 18.7%. The 
Group continues to have sufficient capital headroom.
Impact of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates
IG offers its clients opportunities to trade in over 15,000 markets. 
Our clients have the opportunity to gain exposure to these markets 
in the natural currency of that market or, in many cases, their 
account currency. The Group hedges its exposure to the underlying 
markets and to currencies. The Group’s trading revenue from OTC 
leveraged derivatives is the aggregate of the transaction fees on 
many millions of individual client trades net of the transaction fees 
on hedging the exposures, which are also denominated in a number 
of currencies. These transactions are almost all booked in entities 
whose functional currency is GBP . It is impractical to isolate the 
effect that changes in foreign currency exchange rates have on the 
Group’s GBP reported revenue.
Around one third of the Group’s operating expenses are incurred 
in currencies other than GBP . Although it is possible to identify the 
effect that changes in foreign currency exchange rates have on the 
GBP reported costs, as it is not practical to do so on revenue, the 
Group accepts that it manages its earnings in GBP , and reports on 
and explains its results accordingly.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued
Other costs
The £11.0 million increase in other costs to £59.7 million reflects changes as follows:
Year ended 31 May 2017 Year ended 31 May 2016
Premises-related costs 13.2 12.1
Telephone and data 2.0 1.7
IT Maintenance and support 12.2 9.7
Market data 9.7 7.9
Legal and professional costs 8.0 6.8
Net charge for impaired trade receivables 3.0 1.6
Payment card charges 2.2 0.4
Other costs 9.4 8.5
59.7 48.7
The higher IT maintenance and support costs reflect investments made in data security and IT infrastructure. The higher market data costs 
reflect the growth in client numbers. The higher payment card charges are due to the increased volume of card payments by clients. 
Taxation
The effective rate of tax for the year ended 31 May 2017 was 20.8% – slightly lower than the effective rate of 21.0% for the prior year. The 
effective rate of tax has continued to benefit from the reduction in the standard rate of UK corporation tax, which reduced from 20% to 19% 
on 1 April 2017.
The vast majority of the Group’s taxable profit arises in the UK. An analysis of the tax charge by geographic segment is shown in note F of 
the Other Information section of the Financial Statements. The Group’s effective rate of tax remains dependent on the mix of taxable profit 
by geography, the availability and use of taxable losses and the tax rates levied in those geographies. The Group’s current estimate of the 
effective rate of tax for the year to 31 May 2018 is 20.5%.
The calculation of the Group’s tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgment, in particular with respect to certain items whose 
tax treatment cannot be finally determined until agreement has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share of 45.9 pence for the year to 31 May 2017 are 3% higher than the 44.6 pence for the year ended 31 May 2016. 
Diluted earnings per share is used as a primary measure of profitability and as a financial measure in relation to the Executive Director and 
senior management share plans. 35

RISK MANAGEMENT 
FRAMEWORK
IG has an established Risk Management Framework to identify, 
measure, manage and monitor the risks faced by the business, 
and to manage the risk that the Group’s conduct may pose to 
the achievement of fair outcomes for consumers or to the sound, 
stable, resilient and transparent operation of the financial markets. 
This framework provides the Board with assurance that IG’s risks, 
including the risks relating to the achievement of Group’s strategic 
objectives, are understood and managed in accordance with 
the appetite and tolerance levels set. It provides the basis for 
enabling the Group’s ongoing assessment and monitoring of capital 
adequacy and its liquidity risk management. The framework is 
established around the following elements:
• Risk culture
• Risk Principles
• Risk Taxonomy
• Risk Appetite Statement
• Risk management governance
• Risk assessment, monitoring, control and reporting
Risk culture
The Board recognises that embedding a sound risk culture 
is fundamental to the effective operation of the Group’s Risk 
Management Framework, and sets the tone for broader conduct in 
all business activities and for promoting a common set of IG values 
and expected behaviours.
The Group’s culture is defined by the shared values, attitudes, 
competencies and behaviours present throughout the business.  
A poor culture will inevitably lead to an increase in certain areas  
of risk. 
The Group seeks to achieve the implementation of its desired 
risk management culture through principles, policies and 
practices, including:
• The core Risk Principles set out below that drive risk 
management in IG 
• The firm’s Risk Appetite Statement that clearly defines the type 
and level of risk the Group is willing to accept in pursuit of 
its objectives
• The adoption of a comprehensive policy framework 
to ensure that all employees are aware of their risk 
management responsibilities
• The allocation of responsibility for identification, assessment, 
mitigation and reporting of risks to management across 
the business (including front office, control functions and 
executive management)
• A performance management process that links staff appraisals 
and remuneration to risk management and conduct
• Corporate communications that reinforce awareness and 
understanding of the Group’s desired risk management culture 
and associated policies
Risk Principles
The IG Risk Management Framework is driven by a set of core 
principles that set the context for risk management activities across 
the Group:
• Risk management should be clearly focused on enhancing 
shareholder value and supporting the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic objectives
• The approach to risk management should address the 
requirements and expectations of the firm’s key stakeholders 
(including clients and employees as well as investors 
and regulators)
• Risk and control oversight functions should be independent of 
business functions and supported by adequate resources
• The Board risk appetite should clearly articulate the types 
and amount of risk the Group is willing to accept in pursuit of 
its objectives
• Risk management should be fully embedded into all 
departments and business processes of the Group and managed 
as an integral part of day-to-day management
• Risk management activities should be appropriate for the 
level and complexity of the firm’s business activities and 
associated risks
• Risk management should be subject to continual review 
and enhancement to ensure that the Group’s Risk 
Management Framework remains effective and aligned to 
stakeholder expectations
Risk Taxonomy
IG has developed a Risk Taxonomy to ensure that the Group 
considers the full spectrum of risks faced by the business, and to 
create a single language for classifying risks in all risk management 
activities. The taxonomy categorises the principal risks faced 
by the Group into five areas: the risks inherent in the regulatory 
environment, the risks inherent in the commercial environment, 
business model risk, operational risk and conduct risk. Each of these 
areas of risk is considered below, with an overview of how IG seeks 
to manage them.
Risk Appetite Statement
The Group’s Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) defines the level of risk 
the IG Board is willing to take in pursuit of its business objectives 
and strategic goals. The RAS provides parameters within which the 
business can operate and facilitates an articulation of the business 
risks to relevant stakeholders. 
The statement contains a set of high-level principles and Key Risk 
Indicators (KRIs). These are a balance of quantitative and qualitative 
measures that provide an indication of increasing or reducing risk 
levels, designed to alert the Board and management that risk is 
approaching or has exceeded an acceptable level. This enables the 
triggering of an appropriate responsive action.
We use nine key financial and non-financial performance metrics to measure our performance 
and progress against the short-term and long-term goals of the business.

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
The Group’s risk appetite is set within IG’s overall risk capacity, 
at a level which considers the potential impact to IG’s various 
stakeholders. It articulates a high-level view of the maximum loss 
or exposure the firm is willing to accept with respect to each of its 
principal risks.
The RAS provides a benchmark for calibrating the risk limits and 
indicators which operationally define the levels of exposure the firm 
can take on (eg the market risk exposure limits), as well as the levels 
of loss the firm can sustain without needing to escalate and take 
action. These indicators are monitored daily and reported weekly to 
the Executive Risk Committee and monthly in the Board Report.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
GOVERNANCE
The Group’s risk management governance structure is 
summarised below.
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility for the management of risk 
within the Group. This includes determining the Group’s risk 
appetite, which sets out the nature and extent of the principal 
risks it is willing to take in achieving its objectives, and defining 
the standards and expectations that drive the Group’s risk culture. 
It also involves ensuring that the Group maintains an appropriate 
and effective Risk Management Framework, and monitoring 
performance and risk indicators to ensure that the Group remains 
within its risk appetite. The Board delegates certain risk governance 
responsibilities to Board Committees. 
Board Risk Committee
The Board Risk Committee provides the principal forum for the 
ongoing review and evaluation of specific elements of the Risk 
Management Framework and for making recommendations to 
the Board as appropriate. To exercise these responsibilities, 
the Committee:
• Considers the risk appetite and KRIs and recommends for 
approval by the Board
• Reviews and challenges the Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP), Individual Liquidity Adequacy 
Assessment (ILAA) and Recovery Plan
• Reviews the Group’s major risk exposures, oversees rigorous 
stress-testing and scenario-testing of the Group’s business, and 
ensures that a sufficient level of risk mitigation is in place
• Considers the adequacy and effectiveness of the technology 
infrastructure and supporting documentation in the Risk 
Management Framework
• Considers the adequacy and effectiveness of the second line of 
defence risk management function
• Provides input to the Remuneration Committee on the alignment 
of the remuneration policy to risk performance
Audit and Remuneration Committees
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include reviewing the 
Group’s internal controls and risk management systems in the 
performance of its duties, as well as the assessment of the 
control environment through the review of internal audit activities 
and of the progress on implementing internal and external 
audit recommendations. The Audit Committee has a specific 
responsibility to assess the accuracy and appropriateness of 
financial reporting and narrative disclosures, the Group’s tax risk 
management, the control environment for client money and assets, 
and legal entity governance.
The Remuneration Committee’s primary responsibility in relation 
to risk management is to ensure that remuneration policies are 
consistent with effective risk management across the Group, and 
to consider the implications of those elements of the policies on 
risk and risk management. The Committee reviews the design 
and operation of performance-related pay schemes to ensure 
their effectiveness and, with the assistance of the Board Risk 
Committee, that the risks of the schemes are adequately monitored 
and controlled.
Risk management within the business
IG operates a ‘three lines of defence’ risk governance model.
First line of defence
The first line of defence has primary responsibility for risk 
management, including day-to-day responsibility for ensuring 
that the business operates within risk appetite. Management is 
responsible for the identification, assessment and management 
of risks facing the business, in compliance with the firm’s risk 
management policies. 
The Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, 
provides advice and support to management in the monitoring of 
the day-to-day management of the Group’s operations.
The Executive Risk Committee supports the risk function and 
operational management in the day-to-day operation of risk 
management. The Committee meets weekly. The frequency of 
Committee meetings reflects the corporate commitment of senior 
management to play an active role in day-to-day management and 
control of risk. This sets the tone across IG that risk management 
is central to corporate culture. The Committee oversees the 
day-to-day risk management activity across the Group, receives, 
analyses and evaluates risk management information, and addresses 
specific risk management issues as they arise.
The Client Money and Assets Committee has specific 
responsibilities with respect to risk management activities relating to 
the segregation of client money and assets.
Second line of defence
The second line of defence, independent risk oversight, is provided 
by the risk, compliance and other control functions. These are 
independent from operational management in the first line, 
and responsible for overseeing and challenging the business in 
managing its risks day-to-day. This includes maintaining the Group’s 
risk management and control policies, providing independent 
analysis control of the Group’s risks and keeping abreast of industry 
and regulatory developments that might require enhancements to 
the Group’s Risk Management Framework.
Third line of defence
The third line of defence, independent assurance, is provided 
by internal audit. The primary role of internal audit is to help the 
Board and executive management to protect the assets, reputation 
and sustainability of the organisation by providing independent, 
objective assurance reviews designed to add value and improve our 
operations. The scope of the annual audit plan includes reviews of 
the firm’s Risk Management Framework and the management of the 
firm’s principal risks. These will include assessments of the design 
and operating effectiveness of the internal governance structures 
and processes, the setting of and adherence to risk appetite and the 
risk and control culture of the organisation.
Risk assessment, monitoring, control  
and reporting
Risk assessment, monitoring and control are the responsibility of 
operational management in each area. Risk and control assessments 
are undertaken with support from the second and third lines of 
defence, and key controls are identified and documented.
Risk reporting is undertaken daily, with several reports covering key 
market, credit, liquidity and capital adequacy metrics. 
A weekly risk dashboard is presented to the Executive Risk 
Committee and provides key metrics and commentary covering 
market, credit, liquidity and operational risk exposures, including 
stress-testing results. The dashboard also provides a review of 
clients with significant exposures and a summary of operational 
incidents and associated remedial actions.
The monthly Board risk report sets out a suite of metrics covering 
capital adequacy, liquidity and key risk exposures. This includes 
summaries of market risk performance, credit provisions and debt 
experience, and operational risk metrics. The report also contains 
specific metrics on conduct risk, information security and cyber risk. 
The metrics each have defined tolerance thresholds linked to the 
Group’s risk appetite that require escalation and action where amber 
or red thresholds are reached.
The Group undertakes a quarterly review of its regulatory capital 
and liquidity position, including a review of Pillar 2 risks and 
scenarios used to assess the Group’s projected capital position 
under stress scenarios, through the ICAAP and ILAA processes.
Principal risks
IG’s Risk Taxonomy categorises the principal risks faced by the firm 
into five areas: the risks inherent in the regulatory environment, the 
risks inherent in the commercial environment, business model risk, 
operational risk and conduct risk. The major risks identified within 
each of these areas are summarised in the table below, and overleaf 
we provide an overview of how IG seeks to manage them.
