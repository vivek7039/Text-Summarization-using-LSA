The Companies Act 2006 requires the company’s auditor to 
report to the shareholders on certain parts of the Directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether, in its opinion, those 
parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
The parts of the Annual report on directors’ remuneration 
that have been audited are indicated in that report. The Annual 
statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and the Remuneration policy are not subject to audit.
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to introduce Caledonia’s 
Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2017 .
Remuneration policy
Caledonia’s current policy on directors’ remuneration was 
approved by shareholders in 2014 and therefore, in accordance 
with statute, must be put to shareholders for renewal at the 2017 
annual general meeting. Over the past year, the Remuneration 
Committee has considered how well the current policy is linked to 
the company’s strategy, whether alternative arrangements could 
be implemented to simplify our pay structures, whether the 
overall quantum of directors’ pay is appropriate and whether the 
rewards receivable by management remain closely aligned with 
shareholder experience. This review has been conducted against 
an increasing public debate about executive pay and its future 
direction, both in political circles and in the investor community. 
Focus on this area is likely to continue and could result in 
significant changes in market practice on executive pay, although 
precisely how remains unclear. The Remuneration Committee 
believes that it is important for Caledonia, given its long term 
investment horizon, to maintain consistency in its remuneration 
framework, provided it remains fit for purpose. It will however 
continue to monitor the ongoing public debate and any future 
developments in executive pay.
The Remuneration Committee’s review of the current policy 
confirmed that it remains closely aligned to Caledonia’s business 
model and strategy, the ultimate aim of which is to grow the 
company’s net assets and dividends paid to shareholders in real 
terms over the long term, whilst managing risk to mitigate 
volatility of returns. Specifically, the Remuneration Committee 
considers that the performance measures adopted for the short 
and long term incentive plans underpin the board’s aim to deliver 
consistent annualised returns of between RPI+3% and RPI+6%, 
which history has shown should lead to outperformance of most 
equity markets, and in particular the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index, over rolling ten year periods. 
The Remuneration Committee is however sensitive to public 
concerns around executive pay, in particular in relation to 
complexity and quantum, and therefore is proposing the 
following refinements to the current policy for the 2017 renewal:
•	 the deferred bonus plan matching share arrangements will 
be discontinued, although any bonus in excess of 50% of basic 
salary will still be deferred into shares for a three year period 
and subject to the usual bad leaver forfeiture provision.
•	 to compensate for the loss of earnings potential under the 
deferred bonus matching scheme (which could deliver up to 
75% of basic salary with maximum compulsory and voluntary 
deferral), the standard annual awards under the 
performance share scheme for executive directors 
will be increased from 125% of basic salary to 150%
•	 as previously indicated, clawback provisions which will, in 
certain circumstances, enable the company to recover amounts 
previously paid, will be introduced for all elements of variable 
pay, in addition to the malus arrangements (which enable the 
company to withhold amounts not yet paid) already in place.

46 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
The Remuneration Committee believes that these refinements 
will both simplify the company’s remuneration structure and 
reduce the maximum amount of pay that could be earned by 
executive directors. By substituting performance share scheme 
awards for deferred bonus matching, a greater proportion of 
variable pay will be subject to a five year performance period, 
which now applies to two-thirds of shares awarded annually 
under the performance share scheme. 
The Remuneration Committee has taken the opportunity to 
consult with some of Caledonia’s larger shareholders and 
certain institutional investor representative bodies on the 
revised remuneration policy. No changes were requested, 
however the Remuneration Committee is nonetheless very 
grateful for the feedback received.
We hope therefore that the revised policy, as set out in full on 
pages 47 to 55 will receive your support at the annual general 
meeting on 20 July 2017. 
Remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2017
The Annual report on directors’ remuneration set out on pages 
56 to 63 describes in detail how the current remuneration 
policy has been applied for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
However, I would like to highlight the following points:
Annual bonus
Strong performance over the year, at company, pool and 
individual level, resulted in maximum bonus awards for all 
executive directors.
Deferred bonus matching awards
The deferred bonus matching awards granted in 2014 reached 
the end of their three year performance period. In aggregate, 
67% of the awards vested, as the two-thirds of the awards 
measured by reference to Caledonia’s net asset value per share 
total return (‘NAVTR’) against the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index over the period comfortably achieved maximum vesting, 
outperforming by 18.9%, whereas the one-third measured 
against the FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts (all-stocks) 
Total Return index (‘Gilts index’) fell short of the minimum 
vesting level by 1.7% and therefore lapsed. The Remuneration 
Committee did consider whether the outcome of the Gilts 
index measure was anomalous given the extraordinary 
performance of the gilts market over the past three years due 
to the effects of quantitative easing and, more recently, the 
Brexit vote and therefore did not provide a fair measure of 
Caledonia’s performance over the period. It concluded, 
however, that it would be inappropriate to change the 
performance target post-grant.
Performance share scheme awards
Half of the performance share scheme awards granted in 
2014 reached the end of their performance period this year. 
Measured by reference to Caledonia’s annualised NAVTR 
over the three year period, these achieved maximum vesting as 
the company’s annualised NAVTR of 11.4% exceeded the 10% 
needed and the Funds pool’s annualised total return (relevant 
for Jamie Cayzer-Colvin’s awards) of 23.7% was well above the 
13.5% needed for maximum vesting. The remaining half of the 
2014 performance share scheme awards will be tested in 2019.
Remuneration for the year ending 31 March 2018
Looking ahead to the 2018 financial year, basic salaries of 
executive directors have been increased with effect from 
1 April 2017 by 2.5%, broadly in line with inflation, which was 
the same as the standard increase given to all of the company’s 
staff. Following a review of non-executive directors’ fees in 
the self-managed investment trust sector and of FTSE 250 
companies generally, the Remuneration Committee has 
decided that, on the appointment of the new Chairman at 
the annual general meeting in July, the Chairman’s fee will 
be reduced from £184,500 to £150,000 per annum. The 
other non-executive directors’ fees have not been changed. 
Subject to shareholder approval of the revised remuneration 
policy, we plan to make performance share scheme and 
compulsory deferred bonus awards following the annual 
general meeting in July in line with the new policy described 
above. The performance share scheme awards will be subject 
to the same performance measures used for the 2016 award 
grants, which are summarised in the notes to the remuneration 
policy table on pages 50 and 51.
