 Group revenue of £15.4bn was 15% 
ahead of last year and adjusted 
operating profit of £1,363m was  
22% ahead. Given the economic and 
currency uncertainties a year ago, 
these results demonstrate the benefit 
of our international diversity and the 
strong underlying performance of  
our businesses. I am therefore very 
pleased to report excellent progress 
this year with adjusted earnings  
per share up 20% to 127.1 pence.
Gross investment was again significant 
this year at £945m. This comprised 
£866m of capital expenditure and 
operating intangible assets, driven by  
a higher level of investment by Primark 
with expenditure in all its countries  
of operation, and £79m on business 
acquisitions. This year we delivered a 
particularly impressive cash flow which 
emphasises the group’s ability to convert 
profitability into cash. We also realised 
proceeds, net of costs and tax, of over 
£500m from two business disposals. 
Together these resulted in last year’s  
net debt of £315m becoming a net  
cash balance of £673m this year end.
As anticipated, we delivered a strong 
recovery in sugar profits this year.  
This was a consequence of the recent 
structural changes made to AB Sugar, 
the considerable benefit derived from 
performance improvement over a 
number of years and an increase in EU 
sugar prices. Moving to full ownership  
of Illovo last year has proved to be a 
positive step with an increase in profit 
which benefited from an acceleration  
of its commercial development and 
performance improvement. We believe 
that we are well placed to take advantage 
of the removal of sugar quotas in the  
EU arising from the reform of the sugar 
regime, and to meet the challenges 
including the recent fall in EU  
sugar prices.
Further cost reduction drove the 
continued recovery of the yeast and 
bakery ingredients business while 
excellence in execution was the  
driver of the strong performance  
from speciality ingredients. Together  
they increased adjusted operating  
profit by 34% this year.
EXCELLENT PROGRESS

04 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Associated British Foods plc WWW.ABF.CO.UK/RESPONSIBILITY
Good progress was made by Twinings 
Ovaltine, ACH in the US and George 
Weston Foods in Australia, but Grocery 
results were held back by the trading 
environment faced by the UK bakeries. 
Since the year end we have completed 
the acquisition of Acetum S.p.A.,  
a producer of high-quality balsamic 
vinegar from Modena, Italy. We look 
forward to the opportunity of developing 
further this fine business, using  
our existing capability in selling and 
marketing speciality foods internationally. 
Primark has the potential for significant 
growth and this was demonstrated  
again this year by its opening of a  
net 30 stores and 1.5 million sq ft of  
selling space across nine countries.  
The Primark management team  
also had further success in mitigating 
currency headwinds, they delivered  
on-trend fashion and their stores have 
never looked better. We look forward  
to further growth in the coming year.
Two business disposals took place  
at the beginning of the financial year.  
In November 2016 the sale of our US 
herbs and spices operation significantly 
reduced the complexity of ACH and 
facilitated a reduction in overhead.  
In December 2016 we sold our cane 
sugar operations in south China to a 
party better placed to drive its further 
development. We are proud of the 
transformation in agricultural productivity, 
sugar yields and factory efficiencies  
that we achieved over our 20 years of 
ownership. We realised a pre-tax profit  
of £293m from these two disposals  
with little impact on the group’s  
trading profit.
Corporate responsibility
Our group has grown and evolved 
considerably since its formation in  
1935 and a great deal has changed,  
but the essence of what we do has 
remained a constant. Operating ethically 
is a core value at the heart of our group 
and our intention has always been to  
do the right thing for our people and  
the wider community, believing  
that we achieve this by feeding and  
clothing millions of people every day.  
Our approach to ensuring that this is 
sustained is described in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report which has  
been updated this year. A copy of the 
update is available for download at  
www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
Remuneration
As noted in the Remuneration report  
we revised our remuneration policy  
last year to align it more closely with  
our business strategy. In particular,  
an additional earnings per share  
measure was introduced into the long 
term incentive plan that is designed  
to take into account volatility in world  
and European sugar prices. Although 
incentive payments under this additional 
measure will not arise until 2019,  
the changes in sugar prices seen over 
recent months support this decision.
The board
We are announcing today that Tim Clarke 
will retire as a director with effect from 
30 November 2017, after 13 years on  
the board. Tim’s extensive experience  
in retailing and his wise counsel over  
the years have been of immeasurable 
value and we are very grateful for his 
substantial contribution. His tenure  
did not diminish his independence at  
any time.
Javier Ferrán has completed more  
than nine years’ service as a director  
of the Company and, in accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code,  
the rest of the board must now confirm 
his independence annually. This having 
been done, we are delighted that Javier 
has agreed to continue as a member  
of the board and, with Tim’s retirement,  
to take on the responsibilities of Senior 
Independent Director.
We have recently announced the 
appointment of Michael McLintock as a 
non-executive director of the Company 
with effect from 1 November 2017. 
Michael is currently a trustee of the 
Grosvenor Estate and a non-executive 
director of Grosvenor Group. He was 
chief executive of M&G Investments 
from 1997 until his retirement in 2016. 
He became a member of the Audit  
and Remuneration committees  
on appointment.
Employees
Our 133,000 colleagues in 50 countries 
contribute to the success of the group 
and I would like to thank them for 
everything they bring to their businesses. 
It is their innovation, entrepreneurial  
skill, drive and ambition that enable  
us to grow and develop, and through 
their collaboration, build a network that  
makes the whole so much greater  
than the sum of its parts.
Dividends
I am pleased to report that a final 
dividend of 29.65p is proposed, to be paid 
on 12 January 2018 to shareholders on 
the register on 15 December 2017. 
Together with the interim dividend  
of 11.35p paid on 7 July 2017, this will  
make a total of 41.0p for the year,  
an increase of 12%.
Outlook
Primark’s selling space expansion  
will continue and with margins in line 
with the current year we expect an 
increase in Retail profit. Progress is 
expected from Grocery, Agriculture and 
Ingredients. In Sugar, higher volumes 
and lower costs will only partially 
mitigate the effect of much lower  
EU prices.
At current exchange rates we expect  
no material transactional or translational 
effect on profit.
Taking all of these factors into account,  
at this early stage, we expect progress  
in adjusted operating profit and adjusted 
earnings per share for the group for the 
coming year.
