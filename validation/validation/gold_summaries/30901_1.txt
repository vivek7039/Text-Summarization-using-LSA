 Strategic Report
Chief Executive's Review
With profits at the top end of the expectations 
we set out some 15 months ago, net debt 
lower than we expected, fully funded pension 
schemes, and strong order intake, we delivered 
a solid performance in 2017 in a difficult market. 
Most importantly, we expect profits to grow 
in both 2018 and 2019. We understand that 
getting to this point has been a long haul 
for investors, and that there is still a long, 
and probably bumpy, road ahead before we 
are producing acceptable returns. But we 
are now moving forward, not backward.
The benefits of our international footprint have never 
been more evident as the UK market for public service 
outsourcing is afflicted by well-publicised traumas. This 
environment may produce opportunities for suppliers 
with strong track records of delivery, and Serco also 
has the advantage of choice as to where we allocate 
resources and effort between different markets. 
Therefore, as well as ensuring that we support our UK 
customers, and respond appropriately to opportunities 
as they arise, we will also be investing in our businesses in 
North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.
The challenges facing governments around the world 
remain unchanged. Ageing populations are driving 
demand for more and better public services; almost 
all governments spend more than they receive in tax; 
citizens have ever-higher expectations of the quality of 
public services. In this environment, governments are 
likely to want to use all means at their disposal to deliver 
value for money and high quality public services, which 
should mean a strong continuing role for the private 
sector as a provider of innovation, investment and 
operational management.
Highlights
• Reported Revenue
(1)
 down 2%, comprising a 6% 
organic decline from net contract attrition, partially 
offset by a 4% currency benefit.
• Order intake up 36% at £3.4bn (2016: £2.5bn), includes 
Grafton prison in Australia which is the Group’s 
largest ever contract win, and over 30 other contract 
awards worth more than £10m each across the UK, 
Europe, America and the Middle East; book-to-bill 
ratio of over 100% for the first time since 2012; closing 
order book increased to £10.7bn, up from £9.9bn a 
year earlier.
• Underlying Trading Profit
(2)
 was at the top end of 
our guidance given at the start of the year; run-rate 
throughout 2017 has been approximately 10% ahead 
of that achieved in H2 2016.
• Operating costs reduced in proportion to the scale 
of revenue reduction; further shared services and 
overhead savings of around £20m achieved, taking 
total overhead savings over the last three years to 
over £100m.
• Reported result includes a £16m net charge of Contract 
& Balance Sheet Review adjustments, compared 
to a net release of £14m in 2016; cumulatively over 
the last three years, we are tracking 3% better than 
the Contract & Balance Sheet Review charges taken 
in 2014. Closing balance sheet Onerous Contract 
Provision (OCP) liability now stands at £168m, down 
from £220m in 2016 and £447m in 2014.
• Pre-exceptional tax costs were £14m (2016: £16m),  
and net exceptional costs were significantly lower at 
£25m (2016: £68m).
• Free Cash Flow
(4)
 outflow improved by £26m to 
(£6.7m), which includes (£8m) of outflow as we 
reduced our working capital facility utilisation to zero 
by the end of 2017. Net Debt at £141m (2016: £109m) 
was some £9m below our guidance range at the start 
of the year, and Net Debt : EBITDA leverage of 1.4x 
remains well within our medium term target of 1–2x.
• Pension schemes fully funded and in a surplus on an 
accounting basis; around half of our pension liabilities 
are now fully underwritten by bulk annuity purchases, 
further reducing pension scheme residual risks.
• Pipeline of larger new bid opportunities reduced to 
£4.4bn, as a number of unusually large opportunities 
moved through the pipeline during 2017; £3bn of the 
pipeline are opportunities added over the course 
of 2017.

Notes to summary table of financial results:
(1)  Revenue is as defined under current IFRS (before adoption of IFRS15), which excludes Serco’s share of revenue of its joint ventures and associates. Revenue 
including that from discontinued operations (£nil in 2017 and £36.8m in 2016) is shown for consistency with previous disclosures. Reported Revenue excludes 
revenue from discontinued operations. Organic revenue growth is the change at constant currency after adjusting to exclude the impact of relevant 
acquisitions or disposals. Change at constant currency is calculated by translating non-Sterling values for the year ended 31 December 2017 into Sterling at 
the average exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2016.
(2)  Trading Profit is defined as IFRS Operating Profit adjusted for (i) amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on acquisition and (ii) exceptional items; 
it includes the impact of discontinued operations in 2016. Consistent with IFRS, it includes Serco’s share of profit after interest and tax of its joint ventures 
and associates. Underlying Trading Profit additionally excludes Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments (principally Onerous Contract Provision (OCP) 
releases or charges), as well as the beneficial treatment of depreciation and amortisation of assets held for sale during 2016, and other material one-time 
items such as the pension scheme settlement in the first half of 2016 related to the profit on early exit from a UK local authority contract that occurred in the 
second half of 2015. A reconciliation of Underlying Trading Profit to Trading Profit and Reported Operating Profit is as follows:
Year ended 31 December £m 2017 2016 
Underlying Trading Profit 69.8 82.1
Include: non-underlying items  
Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments (15.8) 14.2
Assets held for sale depreciation and amortisation – 0.5
Other one-time items – 3.5
Trading Profit 54.0 100.3

Reported Operating Profit Before Exceptional Items (continuing operations only) 49.6 98.5
Operating Exceptional Items (continuing operations only) (19.6) (56.3)
Reported Operating Profit (after exceptional items; continuing operations only) 30.0 42.2
(3) Underlying EPS reflects the Underlying Trading Profit measure after deducting pre-exceptional net finance costs and related tax effects.
(4)  Free Cash Flow is the net cash flow from operating activities before exceptional items as shown on the face of the Group’s Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, adding dividends we receive from joint ventures and associates, and deducting net interest paid and net capital expenditure on tangible and 
intangible asset purchases.
(5)  The Global Services division, representing private sector BPO operations, was classified as a discontinued operation in 2015 and 2016. Disposal of the 
offshore business was largely completed in December 2015, with the disposals of two remaining much smaller elements completed in March 2016 and 
December 2016. The residual UK onshore private sector BPO operations were sold or exited in 2016 with the exception of one business, consisting of a single 
contract, which completed in July 2017. Total revenues for the remaining operations were £5.4m and the loss before exceptional items was £0.6m for the year 
ended 31 December 2017, and therefore the results have been included in continuing operations in 2017 on the grounds of materiality.
Reconciliations and further detail of financial performance are included in the Finance Review on pages 50 to 68. This includes full definitions and explanations 
of the purpose and usefulness of each non-IFRS Alternative Performance Measure (APM) used by the Group. The consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes are on pages 151 to 227.
• Acquisition of BTP Systems completed for 
$20m, bringing deep skills in defence satellite 
communication and radar engineering technical 
services, together with a pipeline of $200m.
• We have signed a revised agreement with the Special 
Managers and Provisional Liquidators of Carillion 
plc, and while it is subject to requisite third party 
consents, we continue to work with all relevant parties 
to acquire the portfolio of selected UK health facilities 
management contracts.
• IFRS15 estimated restatement to 2017 not anticipated 
to be significant; decrease revenue by £3m and 
Underlying Trading Profit by £0.3m.
• Guidance for 2018 unchanged: we expect revenues 
to be £2.8–2.9bn, broadly flat in constant currency, 
and Underlying Trading Profit to grow to around 
£80m, driven largely by transformation savings. We 
expect 2019 to see further good growth in Underlying 
Trading Profit.

Chief Executive's Review continued
Summary of financial performance 
Revenue and Trading Profit
Reported Revenue declined 2% to £2,954m (2016: 
£3,011m); this measure excludes Serco’s share of revenue 
from joint ventures and associates of £357m (2016: £481m); 
also excluded in the prior year is revenue of £37m from 
discontinued operations, which reflected the residual 
run-off of the private sector BPO division. Net currency 
movements provided a £122m benefit or a 4% increase. 
At constant currency and adjusting for minor effects of 
relevant acquisitions and disposals, the organic revenue 
decline was £188m or 6%; around a third of the organic 
element of the decline relates to no longer recognising 
as revenue the value of goods purchased on behalf of 
customers following changes to two health procurement 
services contracts in the UK; the balance of the decline 
relates to the ending or transfer of contracts such as those 
for the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory 
(DSTL), Armidale Class Patrol Boats (ACPB) for the Royal 
Australian Navy, Virginia Department of Transportation 
(VDOT), US Army transition assistance (SFLTAP) and 
Western Australia Court Security and Custodial Services 
(WACSCS). These and the effect of other smaller contract 
attrition were only partially offset by growth elsewhere 
including that from the phased start of new services 
during the year at Barts Health NHS Trust, University 
Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and Skills 
Support for the Workforce (SSW).
Underlying Trading Profit was £69.8m (2016: £82.1m), a 
decline of £12.3m or, excluding the £6.5m net currency 
benefit, a decline of £18.8m. The reduction was driven 
by the first half of 2016 benefiting from £11m of non-
recurring trading items, which included: the previous 
higher shareholding and therefore larger share of the 
profits of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE); 
the final settlement arrangements on the transfer of the 
Northern Rail franchise; the conclusion of the VDOT and 
SFLTAP operations; and a spike in activity on a defence 
logistics contract in the Middle East. In addition, as well 
as the attrition impact from profitable contracts coming 
to an end, some of the new contracts added revenue 
growth in 2017 but were at reduced profitability due to 
their initial transition and transformation stages.
In the second half of 2016 our Underlying Trading 
Profit was £31.5m, which was a period that did not 
benefit from the non-recurring trading items that were 
a feature of the first half of 2016, and was a period 
that had broadly comparable average currency rates 
to 2017. Profits in both the first and second half 2017 
were £35m, and therefore we have delivered a run-
rate approximately 10% ahead of that achieved in the 
second half of 2016.
Within our performance for the year, we delivered 
our target of £20m of cost savings from efficiencies in 
central support functions and overheads. Cumulatively 
over the last three years, over £100m of cost has been 
removed through our programmes to deliver savings 
by reducing the number of management layers, 
implementing better procurement and driving greater 
efficiency in the operation of shared services. These 
savings have been central to our efforts to reduce the 
scale of Serco’s cost base in proportion to the scale 
of the revenue reduction incurred through the loss of 
contracts and the disposals undertaken.
Trading Profit was £54.0m (2016: £100.3m), with three 
categories of adjusting items which are within Trading 
Profit, but excluded from our measure of Underlying 
Trading Profit. First, there was a £15.8m net charge 
(2016: net release of £14.2m) within Trading Profit arising 
from the review of Onerous Contract Provisions (OCPs) 
and other Contract & Balance Sheet Review items; the 
OCP adjustments comprised gross charges totalling 
£62m (2016: £56m), partially offset by gross releases 
totalling £43m (2016: £66m). By far the most significant 
charge (£47m) related to the future revenue and cost 
assumptions of operating the Caledonian Sleepers 
contract, though across other OCPs in the UK & Europe 
division there was a net release of £16m and in AsPac 
a net release of £11m. Notwithstanding this year’s net 
charge, it is worth noting that cumulatively over the last 
three years, the net improvement to Trading Profit from 
OCPs and other Contract & Balance Sheet Review items 
is £19m; we are therefore tracking 3% better than the 
original charge taken through Trading Profit in 2014. A 
detailed review of provisions and Contract & Balance 
Sheet Review items is included in the Finance Review on 
pages 50 to 68. The second area that we exclude from 
Underlying Trading Profit is other material one-time 
items; in 2016 we therefore excluded from Underlying 
Trading Profit a £3.5m beneficial pension settlement 
negotiated as part of the early termination of the 
Thurrock contract. Third, and again only related to 2016, 
we excluded the beneficial impact of £0.2m related 
to depreciation and amortisation treatment of assets 
classified as held for sale during 2016.
As with prior years, both Trading Profit and Underlying 
Trading Profit benefited from losses on previously-
identified onerous contracts being neutralised by the 
utilisation of OCPs; the £69m utilised in 2017 was both 
better than our expectations of around £80m, and lower 
than the £84m utilised in 2016. The closing balance of 
OCPs now stands at £168m, compared to £220m a year 
earlier and the initial charge of £447m taken at the end 
of 2014. We expect of the remaining £168m provision 
approximately £70m will be utilised in 2018.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34 Financing and pensions, tax and exceptional costs
Pre-exceptional net finance costs were £11.6m (2016: 
£12.6m); while average net debt of £184m was £65m 
higher than the prior year, the increased cost of 
financing this was more than offset by other small 
movements. Cash net interest paid was £17.0m 
(2016: £19.0m).
Within net finance costs is a net credit of £3.8m (2016: 
£4.7m) related to the strong funding position of Serco’s 
pension schemes. This net credit is lower than the 
prior year following the purchase in June 2017 by the 
Trustees of the Serco Pension and Life Assurance 
Scheme (SPLAS) of a bulk annuity from an insurer, 
which, for a significant proportion of scheme members, 
has the effect of fully removing longevity, investment 
and accounting risks. Assets of the pension scheme 
have been transferred to the insurer to purchase the 
annuity, resulting in a reduction in the IAS19 net balance 
sheet asset. The gross liability remains recognised 
on our balance sheet, but there is now an equal and 
opposite insurance asset reflecting the perfect hedge 
established by the transaction.
Including the effect of the transaction, the overall 
pension scheme accounting surplus, before tax, was 
£26m at 31 December 2017 on a scheme gross asset 
base of £1,385m. As described below, the transaction 
resulted in an exceptional non-cash tax charge of 
£16.1m reflecting a deferred tax adjustment related to 
the pension asset movements. Further details of Serco’s 
pension funding and the bulk annuity purchase are 
described more fully in the Finance Review.
Tax and exceptional costs
The underlying effective tax cost was £20.6m (2016: 
£24.4m), representing an underlying effective rate of 
35% (2016: 35%) based upon £58.2m (2016: £69.5m) 
of Underlying Trading Profit less pre-exceptional net 
finance costs. The rate is higher than the UK statutory 
rate of corporation tax as there was no deferred tax 
credit taken against UK losses incurred in the year, and 
because it reflects the tax charges at locally prevailing 
rates in the international divisions which tend to be 
higher than the UK’s rate; these two factors are partially 
offset by the proportion of Serco’s profit before tax 
generated by consolidating our share of joint venture 
and associate earnings which have already been taxed. 
The Underlying effective rate was lower than our initial 
guidance of approximately 50% due to a beneficial 
mix of profitability earned for the year, and due to a 
one-off effect of UK tax legislation enactment being 
recognised as an exceptional tax cost rather than within 
the underlying measure.
Tax on non-underlying items was a net credit of £6.6m 
(2016: credit of £8.5m). The principal driver of this has 
been a credit to reflect recognising a UK deferred tax 
asset of £11.1m based upon the improved outlook of 
future profitability; there is now UK deferred tax asset 
totalling £17.4m recognised on the balance sheet; there 
is a further estimated £160m deferred tax asset in the UK 
that is currently unrecognised and therefore contingent 
upon further improvement in the outlook. Total pre-
exceptional tax costs were therefore £14.0m (2016: 
£15.9m). Exceptional tax costs were £5.0m (2016: credit 
of £3.1m). The principal drivers of this were one-time 
non-cash deferred tax adjustments as follows: a charge 
of £16.1m related to the pension asset movements on 
the bulk annuity purchase; a charge of £3.7m related to 
the change in UK tax legislation regarding the speed of 
utilising tax losses and hence our deferred tax assets; 
and a £12.5m credit reflecting the reduction in the US 
deferred tax liability following the fall in future expected 
US rates primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts & 
Jobs Act in December 2017.
Total tax costs were therefore £19.0m (2016: £12.8m). 
Cash net tax paid was £11.4m (2016: £5.6m). As previously 
described, although we expect our cash tax to be 
reasonably predictable in future periods, our effective 
tax rates are likely to be volatile until we are able to show 
sufficient profitability in our UK business to be able to 
recognise on our balance sheet all of the UK tax asset 
arising from losses in 2014 and 2015 principally as a result 
of the Contract & Balance Sheet Review. Our guidance of 
the underlying effective tax rate for 2018 is however for 
a modest reduction towards 30%, reflecting our forecast 
mix of profitability and the net effect of US tax reform, 
and for it to continue to reduce further over the longer 
term assuming further improvement in profits.
The Group incurred operating exceptional costs of 
£19.6m (2016: £56.3m), mainly comprising £28.6m 
of restructuring programme costs related to the 
Transformation stage of our strategy, including 
redundancy charges, asset impairments and other 
incremental costs; these were partially offset by a non-
cash credit of £10.3m related to the previous transfer 
of employees from the Serco defined pension scheme 
back to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme 
(PCSPS). Together with exceptional tax costs of £5.0m 
(2016: credit of £3.1m) and exceptional items related 
to discontinued operations were £nil (2016: £14.6m); 
total net exceptional costs were therefore £24.6m 
(2016: £67.8m).
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
35 Strategic Report
Chief Executive's Review continued
Reported result for the year
The reported result for the year, as presented at the 
bottom of the Group’s Consolidated Income Statement 
on page 158, was a profit of £0.1m (2016: loss of £1.1m). 
This reflects: Trading Profit of £54.0m (2016: £100.3m); 
amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on 
acquisition of £4.4m (2016: £5.1m); pre-exceptional net 
finance costs of £11.6m (2016: £12.6m); a non-cash fair 
value gain of £0.7m (2016: £nil) relating to increasing our 
ownership in a joint venture; pre-exceptional tax costs 
of £14.0m (2016: £15.9m); and total net exceptional costs 
of £24.6m (2016: £67.8m).
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Underlying EPS, which reflects the Underlying Trading 
Profit measure after deducting pre-exceptional finance 
costs and related tax effects, was 3.42p (2016: 4.13p). 
The reduction reflects the lower Underlying Trading 
Profit, partially offset by lower net finance costs; the 
weighted average number of shares in issue was broadly 
unchanged at 1,089.7m (2016: 1,088.3m). Reported EPS, 
which includes the impact of the other non-underlying 
items and lower tax and exceptional costs, was a loss 
per share of 0.02p (2016: loss per share of 0.11p).
Cash Flow and Net Debt
Free Cash Flow was negative £7m (2016: negative 
£33m). Cash generated from Underlying Trading Profit 
was largely offset by the outflows related to loss-
making contracts subject to OCPs. These cash outflows 
lessened versus the prior year, as reflected in the lower 
rate of OCP utilisation. There was a working capital 
outflow of £9m (2016: outflow of £24m), which included 
£8m (2016: £22m) of reduction in the utilisation of the 
Group’s receivables financing facility; at 31 December 
2017 there was £nil utilisation of the £30m facility, 
whereas £8m was utilised a year earlier.
Closing net debt at 31 December 2017 increased to 
£141m (2016: £109m); the increase includes the Free Cash 
outflow, together with a £33m cash outflow related to 
exceptional items. There was a beneficial gross currency 
translation effect on net debt of £17m, predominantly 
reflecting the Group’s US Private Placement debt, 
however this was partially offset by a £3m adverse 
movement on hedging instruments. The closing net debt 
compares to a daily average of £184m (2016: £119m) and a 
peak net debt of £243m (2016: £183m).
At the closing balance sheet date, our leverage for debt 
covenant purposes was 1.4x EBITDA (2016: 0.7x), which 
compares with the covenant requirement to be less than 
3.5x and remains well within our medium term target 
range of 1–2x.
Dividends
The Board is not recommending the payment of a 
dividend in respect of the 2017 financial year. The 
Board’s appraisal of the appropriateness of dividend 
payments takes into account the Group’s underlying 
earnings, cash flows and financial leverage, together 
with the requirement to maintain an appropriate level 
of dividend cover and the prevailing market outlook. 
Although the Board is committed to resuming dividend 
payments as soon as it believes it prudent to do so, 
in assessing whether we should resume dividend 
payments in respect of 2017, we have been mindful 
of the fact there has been a reduction in earnings, a 
free cash outflow and an increase in net debt. In these 
circumstances, the Board believes that it would not be 
prudent to resume dividend payments at the current 
juncture. For 2018, our guidance is for an improvement 
in Underlying Trading Profit, but we anticipate a  
further modest Free Cash outflow and expect net  
debt to still increase, largely as a result of cash outflows 
related to exceptional restructuring costs and taking 
opportunities for value-enhancing infill acquisitions.  
The Board will continue to keep the dividend policy 
under close consideration as we progress with 
transforming the Group and implementing our strategy.
The Revenue and Trading Profit performances are 
described further in the Divisional Reviews. More 
detailed analysis of earnings, cash flow, financing 
and related matters are described further in the 
Finance Review.
Summary of operating performance  
and strategy implementation
Delivering a financial performance for 2017 at the 
top end of our expectations has been accompanied 
by strong operational delivery and further progress 
on implementing our strategy and transformation. 
Within our operating framework, we insist that all our 
management initiatives fit into one or more of four 
categories: winning good business, executing brilliantly, 
making Serco a place people are proud to work, and 
delivering profitability and sustainability.
Problematic contracts continue to reduce in number and 
financial impact versus where we started three years ago, 
and relationships with customers in each of our markets 
are also fundamentally improved. Where we have exited 
contracts during the year, we have done so with pride 
and excellence, mindful of the military adage that you 
judge a battalion as much by how it leaves its barracks, as 
by how it arrives. Where we have started new operations, 
which have involved the transition and recruitment of 
several thousand employees, again I am pleased with the 
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 36 skill of our operational managers. Where we are making 
losses on contracts, we are resolute in still delivering 
what is required of us to appropriately serve our 
customers and service users; and while doing so, working 
to improve the financial performance of individual 
contracts. Three years on, it is reassuring to note how 
accurate was our initial estimation of the total level of 
onerous provisions required.
Similarly, delivering cost savings at the same time as 
investing in and improving the business is challenging, 
but this has also been paramount to ongoing 
transformation. We achieved our savings target for 
2017, and the cumulative reduction of over £100m from 
efficiencies in central support functions and overheads 
is equivalent to approximately 24% over the last three 
years. Our guidance, as set out in more detail below, 
includes that we expect Underlying Trading Profit to 
grow over the next two years, and this will be driven 
largely by further transformation savings. Over that 
period, we are in particular looking to transform our 
IT systems, capabilities and structures. This means 
not only reducing their cost, but also improving their 
performance and security. We are implementing 
further operating model changes to deliver greater 
efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation; there 
will also be increased contribution to savings from the 
transformation of the finance function and centralising 
expertise for reporting, forecasting, planning and 
analysis with a third party provider, and seeking 
additional rationalisation of disparate procurement 
spend across the Group.
Our ongoing transformation of the business involves 
further strengthening of our sector propositions, 
building differentiated capability, and capturing 
business development opportunities to enhance our 
pipeline and order book. As previously reported, we 
are using Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for Group-wide 
propositions and capabilities in our core markets, which 
are improving the sharing of skills, best practice and 
intellectual property across Serco. 
Whilst demand across our markets has not been as 
strong as we anticipated at the time we announced 
our strategy in 2015, the availability of value-adding 
acquisitions, be they of companies or of contracts, 
presents an opportunity to increase our scale and 
capabilities which was not foreseen in 2015. In our 
US defence business, the acquisition of BTP Systems 
for $20m adds deep skills in satellite communication 
and radar engineering technical services, which 
complements our existing service offering, and also 
brings with it a pipeline of new opportunities of $200m. 
In December 2017, we also signed a Business Purchase 
Agreement to acquire a portfolio of selected UK health 
facilities management contracts from Carillion plc, and 
have subsequently signed a revised agreement with the 
Special Managers and Provisional Liquidators of Carillion; 
whilst it is subject to requisite third party consents, we 
continue to work with all relevant parties to give effect to 
achieving the transfer of the contracts. If it is executed as 
envisaged, this transaction would significantly increase 
the scale of our equivalent Health business, and would 
add around £1bn to our order book.
Serco employs (including our joint venture operations) 
over 50,000 people, the vast majority delivering services 
to customers. Motivating and engaging employees is 
absolutely central to our business, and will be a key 
determinant of demonstrating we have successfully 
implemented our strategy. The latest results of our 
global employee survey, managed independently 
by Aon Hewitt, and with some 31,000 responses, 
showed a fourth successive year of improvement in 
the aggregated measure of ‘employee engagement’. 
During 2017, we also delivered many other elements 
to build capabilities and support our ambition to be 
the best-managed business in our sector. Some 200 
out of 300 senior managers have completed our highly 
tailored Oxford Saïd Serco Management course. We 
have rolled out Continuous Improvement training to all 
managers and embedded it as part of onboarding new 
staff, and over 1,400 employees are now trained to more 
advanced levels. And we have further invested in our 
Contract Management tools such as apps that monitor 
contractual obligations and report in real time, our 
Learning Management System for tracking training and 
qualifications, and our Serco Management System which 
covers all aspects of a contract’s lifecycle, processes 
and compliance requirements.
Contract awards, order book, rebids and pipeline
Contract awards
The Group signed contracts with a total value of 
£3.4bn during the year (2016: £2.5bn), which was 
another year of strong performance. This is the largest 
order intake since 2012, and represents a book-to-
bill ratio of approximately 115%. There were over 30 
contract awards worth more than £10m each, and 
the large value of new business won resulted in this 
being approximately 70% of the total value signed, 
with the balance represented by the value of secured 
extensions or rebids of existing work; the latter was also 
an abnormally small balance by virtue of there being a 
relatively small amount of contracts coming up for rebid 
or extension during 2017.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
37 Strategic Report
The largest new contract signed in the year was to 
operate the New Grafton Correctional Centre (NGCC) 
in New South Wales, which, when completed, will be the 
largest correctional facility in Australia; the estimated 
total contract value to Serco over a 20-year term is 
approximately AUD2.6bn (equivalent to approximately 
£1.5bn). The second largest new contract was with 
University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation  
Trust to transform catering and cleaning, with an 
estimated value of £125m over the ten-year term. 
The third largest was in the Americas division to deliver 
US Army base modernisation services and in particular 
IT support, valued at a total of $140m for the five-year 
base period and five one-year option periods, with 
the fourth also in the US to provide three Navy Fleet 
Readiness Centers with supply chain management 
services for hazardous materials, valued at a total of 
$101m for the base period and four one-year option 
periods. Smaller new bids won included environmental 
services for Rushmoor Borough Council, contact 
services support in Australia for the Department of 
Human Services, facilities management to a financial 
services company in Abu Dhabi, safety service patrol 
for the Texas Department of Transportation, and 
numerous US Navy ship and shore defence equipment 
modernisation task orders.
Of rebids and extensions secured, the largest was 
for NHS Forth Valley to continue providing facilities 
management services for a further seven years, followed 
by the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) for a 
further ten years. Others of note included contact 
services for Hertfordshire County Council, specialist 
scientific and engineering support for the European 
Space Agency, facilities management at the Cleveland 
Clinic in Abu Dhabi, fleet services for Louisville 
Gas & Electric Company, air navigation services in 
Bahrain and Iraq, environmental services for various 
London boroughs, traffic camera support in the 
Australian state of Victoria, and support to passenger 
information services for the Western Australia Public 
Transport Authority.
Win rates by volume were over 50% for new bids and 
over 90% for rebids and extensions. Win rate by value 
was around 25% for new work, with the benefit from the 
sheer scale of the Grafton win being offset by the loss 
of the other big opportunities in Middle East rail and 
UK immigration escorting; the win rate by value was 
approximately 90% for securing existing work.
Order book
The Group’s order book now stands at an estimated 
£10.7bn, up by £0.8bn versus a year earlier. There is 
£2.4bn of revenue secured in the order book for 2018, 
equivalent to around 85% visibility of our £2.9bn revenue 
guidance at current exchange rates. The secured order 
book is £1.6bn for 2019 and £1.2bn for 2020.
Rebids
Through to the end of 2020, across the Group there 
are around 60 contracts in our order book with annual 
revenue of over £5m where an extension or rebid will 
be required, representing current annual revenue of 
approximately £1.4bn in aggregate or approaching  
half of the Group’s 2018 £2.9bn revenue guidance.  
This proportion of revenue that requires securing at 
some point over the next three years is not unusual 
given our average contract length of around seven years 
(or approximately ten years on average on a revenue-
weighted basis, as larger contracts typically have longer 
terms). Contracts that could potentially end at some 
point by the end of 2018 have aggregate annual revenue 
of around £500m, with the higher amount versus recent 
years driven in particular by the US Affordable Care Act 
contract becoming due for full rebid this year, and with 
the next largest being Northern Isles Ferries. In 2019, it 
increases to around £700m, with Australian immigration 
services, the Dubai Metro, one of our US Navy 
installation contracts and COMPASS all due for rebid 
or potential extension. In 2020, it is around £200m, with 
PECS the only particularly large contract anticipated to 
become due in that year.
Pipeline
Our pipeline is tightly defined as new bid 
opportunities with estimated Annual Contract Value 
(ACV) of at least £10m and which we expect to bid 
and to be adjudicated within a rolling 24-month 
timeframe. The Total Contract Value (TCV) of individual 
opportunities is capped at £1bn. The definition does 
not include rebids and extension opportunities, and 
on average over the last five years, more than half 
of our order intake has come from opportunities 
outside the reported pipeline. It is a relatively small 
proportion of the total universe of opportunities, 
many of which either have annual revenues less than 
£10m, or are likely to be decided beyond the next 24 
months, or are rebids and extensions. It should also be 
remembered that in the Americas division in particular, 
we have numerous arrangements which are classed 
as ‘IDIQ’ – Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity – 
which are essentially framework agreements under 
which the customer issues task orders one at a time; 
Chief Executive's Review continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 38 whilst the ultimate value of such an agreement may 
be very large and run over many years, a value is only 
recorded in our order book as individual task orders 
are contracted, and few of them would appear in the 
pipeline as they tend to be individually less than £10m 
and contracted on short lead times.
Following several years of decline, at the start of 
2015 the pipeline stood at around £5bn and began 
to grow again, increasing to £6.5bn at the start of 
2016, and stood at £8.4bn at the start of 2017. During 
the year, around £7bn has come out of the pipeline, 
predominantly due to: wins, such as Grafton prison 
(which was capped in the pipeline at £1bn) and 
Southampton NHS Foundation Trust; losses, such as 
those in Middle East rail, UK immigration escorting 
and a US Navy systems support opportunity; as well 
as due to a small number of other opportunities being 
removed such as immigration services in the US. A 
number of new opportunities have now matured to the 
stage where they meet our pipeline definition, adding in 
aggregate around £3bn over the course of the year. As 
a result, the pipeline currently stands at £4.4bn, which 
consists of around 25 bids that have an ACV averaging 
approximately £30m and a contract length averaging 
around six years.
In the services industry in which Serco operates, 
pipelines are often lumpy, as individual opportunities 
can be very large, and when they come in and out 
of the pipeline they can have a material effect on 
reported values. In 2017, a number of unusually large 
bids travelled through the pipeline, and, as anticipated, 
immediately replacing these has been challenging in 
the prevailing market conditions. A lower pipeline is 
not a matter of undue concern: growing our pipeline 
should not be expected to be a smooth progression 
given the effects of the timing and scale of individual 
awards, and we expect profit growth in the next two 
years to be driven by transformation savings. However, 
progress beyond the next two years will require seeing 
improvements in the trading conditions across our 
markets which will need to be first evidenced by a 
pipeline that is growing once again.
Key opportunities in the pipeline are described further 
in the Divisional Reviews.
Risks associated with Serco’s trading environment
Last year, we reported on the risks around our trading 
environment, and focused on the possible impact of 
Brexit, instability in the Middle East, and lack of clarity 
in the US following the election of President Trump.
None of these risks has markedly reduced in the last 
twelve months: in terms of Brexit, our business directly 
serving European bodies which accounts for around 5% 
of Serco’s revenue is unlikely to be greatly affected, as it 
is served by EU-resident companies. We believe Brexit 
may have an impact on labour cost and availability 
in the UK if EU citizens cannot come to UK to work in 
essential frontline service roles. The greatest impact 
for us is that UK Central Government is largely focused 
upon the overwhelming need to manage Brexit, which 
has been described by the Head of the Civil Service 
as the greatest peacetime challenge ever faced by the 
Civil Service, and it is clear that their priority is going 
to be focused in this direction for several years to 
come. However, in the medium term the repatriation of 
swathes of regulatory functions may lead to important 
opportunities, and many of our largest customers – 
most notably the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of 
Justice and the Home Office – still have pressing needs 
to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
In the US, it is clear that the Affordable Care Act or 
‘Obamacare’, and associated contracts such as ours 
providing eligibility processing services to those 
seeking health insurance, will continue in some form, 
although the promised expansion in Defence spending 
is yet to be seen. Disappointingly, there are few signs 
of resolution in the dispute between Qatar and other 
states in the Middle East.
However, since last year’s report, in addition to the 
risks set out above, the UK public sector outsourcing 
market has in recent months been thrown into turmoil 
as the result of the collapse of Carillion, and the 
crystallisation on some contracts of very significant risks 
which government had transferred to suppliers. This has 
reignited the debate about the wisdom of government 
outsourcing to private companies the delivery of public 
services, and we suspect that this will become a theme 
in the next General Election. There is a very real risk that 
this will make the UK Government more than normally 
cautious in dealing with its suppliers. On the other hand, 
it may make them more inclined to deal with suppliers 
who have established a track record for strong delivery, 
prudent accounting and who have a robust balance 
sheet. The possible consequences of these events are 
examined in more detail under ‘Industry Backdrop and 
Concluding Thoughts’, below.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
39 Strategic Report
Guidance and outlook
Our guidance for 2018 and outlook beyond is 
unchanged from that initially provided in our update  
on 13 December 2017.
For 2018, we expect that Underlying Trading 
Profit will grow to around £80m, on revenues of 
£2.8–2.9bn (i.e. broadly flat organic revenue growth 
on a constant currency basis). We therefore expect 
some improvement in margins, driven largely by 
transformation savings. Our guidance reflects latest 
currency rates, which now imply greater pressure from 
adverse currency impacts estimated at £5–6m for profit 
and £100–120m for revenue when compared to  
the average rates for 2017.
As we have noted before in regard to our previous 
guidance, we reiterate that the range of potential 
outcomes is significantly wider than that implied by 
our budget’s central case, both to the upside and 
downside; this reflects Serco’s relatively low margins 
and the sensitivity of our profits to even small changes 
in revenues and costs, as well as movements in currency. 
Furthermore, and as described in more detail in the 
Divisional Reviews, the outcome of new bids in our 
pipeline and in our progress securing extensions or 
rebids including that for the Affordable Care Act in the 
US, could have a material impact on our business both 
in 2018 and more so the following year.
The 2018 financial year will be the first to be reported 
under the new IFRS15 accounting standard. As previously 
disclosed and reflective of the prudent accounting 
practices adopted in recent years by Serco, we do not 
anticipate the impact to be significant – as set out in  
Note 2 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements, 
the estimated restatement to 2017 is to decrease revenue 
by £3m and Underlying Trading Profit by £0.3m. IFRS15 
will be potentially of more relevance to the Group in 
relation to the accounting for new contracts rather 
than those already in place at the time of adopting the 
new standard. The changes brought about by IFRS15 
on previous percentage of completion accounting is 
expected to have little impact on Serco as this form of 
accounting has never been of particular relevance to 
Serco. However, if Serco enters into future contracts 
that have significant transition phases, this could result 
in a greater proportion of revenue and profit being 
recognised later on in the life of the contract than 
under previous accounting. The UK Defence Fire & Risk 
Management Organisation (DFRMO) contract, which  
we are currently bidding, is one such.
We anticipate a further small Free Cash outflow. 
After the cash outflow on exceptional costs, and the 
acquisition consideration for BTP Systems, we anticipate 
closing accounting net debt to increase to £200–250m, 
equivalent to leverage for covenant purposes in the 
range of 1.5–2x EBITDA.
As noted in our previous announcement regarding the 
potential acquisition of health facilities management 
contracts formerly operated by Carillion plc, the effect 
of this transaction is not included in any of our guidance 
at this stage.
Looking further ahead, we expect 2019 to be a year of 
further good growth in Underlying Trading Profit, which 
is again likely to be driven by additional transformation 
savings. The rate of growth thereafter will be more 
dependent on our ability to grow revenues. The 
Strategy Review announced in March 2015 set out a 
long term ambition that the business could grow in line 
with a market which was expected to expand at a long 
term trend rate of 5–7% a year and deliver margins of 
5–6%. Our margin ambition was predicated on three 
conditions: first, reducing costs as a percentage of sales; 
second, containing losses on onerous contracts and 
converting a number of them into profitable contracts 
on rebid; and, thirdly, increasing margins by growing 
revenues whilst bearing down on overheads. We remain 
broadly on track on costs and onerous contracts, but 
some markets, and in particular the UK, are currently 
growing more slowly than their former trend rate. We 
can and will partly compensate for a weaker organic 
revenue outlook through increased actions on the cost 
base, and our long term ambitions of 5–7% revenue 
growth and 5–6% margin remain intact, but the timing 
of achieving this will be dependent upon when demand 
reverts to historic levels in our target markets.
Chief Executive's Review continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40 Industry backdrop and concluding thoughts
“No plan ever survives first contact with the enemy” 
was a phrase first coined by the military strategist 
Helmuth von Moltke in the 19th century. So far, Serco’s 
three-stage plan (Stabilise – Transform – Grow), which 
we conceived in late 2014, has survived contact with 
the flow of events surprisingly well. After a period of 
decline, our profits have started to grow again; we have 
re-established our reputation for operational delivery; 
we have kept our promises to our customers; our 
portfolio of onerous contracts is running off in line with 
the expectations we set in 2014; we have had a strong 
year of order intake in 2017; and we are taking steps to 
improve margins to take us to more normal levels, even 
if weak demand will probably mean it will take us longer 
to get there. We are not yet able to resume dividend 
payments, but our pension schemes are fully funded 
and our balance sheet is robust.
Into this generally positive scene of Serco’s own 
progress has intruded a traumatic event in the form 
of the collapse of one of the UK’s largest suppliers of 
public services, Carillion. Quite apart from the usual 
miseries associated with the bankruptcy of a major 
company, it has put at risk the supply of a number of 
sensitive public service contracts and caused the UK 
Government distraction and expense. Not unnaturally, 
this has reignited the already-glowing embers of 
the debate about the desirability of allowing private 
companies to deliver public services. This cuts to the 
heart of what we do; the UK is Serco’s home market,  
and accounts for around half of our revenue, and 
understanding recent developments is high on the 
agenda of many investors.
It must be stressed that the UK Government successfully 
buys some £200bn of goods and services from private 
companies and charities each year. There are over 
one million people employed by the private sector 
delivering services to Government, and the vast majority 
of this work is delivered to a high standard. Huge 
benefits have been delivered by private companies 
and charities providing public services which are both 
efficient and innovative. Nevertheless, the collapse 
of Carillion stands as a reminder that since 2010 a 
significant number of businesses supplying Government 
services in the UK have suffered very large losses,  
Serco included, and that all is not right in the market  
for Government services in the UK.
How has this situation arisen? In one sense, this is 
the market at work, with a tendency for the balance 
of advantage to move between buyers and sellers in 
accordance with supply and demand. In the ’90’s and 
’00’s, Government was keen to enlist the support of 
private sector companies to improve the efficiency 
and productivity of public services, and many new 
opportunities came to market; the Government was 
feeling its way and trying to develop new contracting 
structures such as Private Finance Initiatives which  
had never been tested before, and was sometimes 
outrun by more sophisticated and canny suppliers, 
who were double-digit revenue growth a year with 
strong margins, cash flows and returns on capital.  
As is the way of markets, this strong growth attracted 
new competitors, many from abroad or from other 
sectors. As is also the way of markets, the flow of  
milk and honey did not last indefinitely.
Around 2010, the balance of power in the market began 
to turn. Government introduced austerity and sought 
to reduce expenditure, the supply of new work slowed, 
just as new competitors entered the market. At the 
same time, Government started to hire poachers and 
made them its gamekeepers, and in recent years has 
improved its commercial and contracting capabilities 
beyond all recognition. Feeling compelled to deliver the 
growth they had promised, suppliers competed fiercely 
for a reducing pool of new business; prices fell, and 
a newly-savvy Government discovered it had anxious 
suppliers prepared to accept risks and contract terms 
which in normal conditions they would not have agreed 
to. Sophisticated buying techniques were imported 
from the private sector; contracts for sensitive public 
services such as caring for asylum seekers were awarded 
to the lowest bidder by online auction. As margins fell, 
suppliers shrank their capital employed and increased 
their debt; some made assumptions in their accounting 
which had the effect of pulling forward reported profits; 
some used opaque financing facilities and extended the 
payment terms to their suppliers to make their reported 
cash flow more nearly match the stretched profits. At 
the same time, falling interest rates and increasing 
longevity sent pension deficits soaring. So in a matter 
of a few years, a sector which previously had delivered 
healthy returns and supported well-capitalised balance 
sheets became under-capitalised, over-leveraged, and 
operationally and financially fragile. Given the amount 
of contractual risk suppliers were carrying, that fragility 
was going to show itself sooner or later.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
41 Strategic Report
Serco was the first major UK public services supplier to 
reveal the consequences of carrying those risks. In 2014, 
we had to take £447m of onerous contract provisions 
to reflect the cost of contractual commitments we 
had made, and in total some £1.3bn of provisions and 
write-downs were required. Fortunately, our banks 
and shareholders backed our decision to stand by our 
commitments to our customers, and we raised some 
£700m of equity and a further £250m from disposals 
to make our balance sheet robust. Since then, few 
suppliers in the sector have escaped unscathed, but 
Carillion is the first major bankruptcy.
Does this matter? Over 12,000 companies go into 
insolvency in a year in the UK, so why should Carillion 
be of such concern? The reason is that the nature of 
public services contracts are that they often involve the 
delivery of services of national importance that need 
to operate 24 hours a day. Hospitals cannot operate 
without cleaners and caterers; courts cannot operate 
without prisoner transport; defence bases cannot 
operate without air traffic control. The security of supply 
of these contracts is a matter of national importance 
and a proper concern of Government.
How did we get into this position? The answer is: 
nobody is blameless. Company managers and directors 
should have remembered the adage that “no deal 
is better than a bad deal”; and that over-optimistic 
accounting judgements, or flattering reported cash 
flow, will always be found out in the end; and that 
pension deficits were not a temporary aberration but a 
liability that needed to be addressed. And for its part, 
Government has used its position as a monopoly buyer 
to push companies, large and small, into accepting 
contractual terms and risks that they could not 
conceivably manage or hedge. Sooner or later, some 
of those risks were bound to crystallise, and when they 
did, suppliers delivering vital public services would be 
mortally wounded and even become functionally or 
formally insolvent, which would not be in the interests  
of either taxpayers or service users.
Where will the market go next? Clearly, both 
Government and suppliers should take time to consider 
carefully the implications of recent events. Suppliers 
will likely become much more wary; there will be fewer 
new entrants; existing players may shift the balance 
of their attention towards other markets, if they can. 
The UK Government runs the risk of being offered less 
choice and innovation, less competition and higher risk 
premiums. And efforts to encourage small and medium 
sized suppliers into the market are likely to be set back, 
as they see what has happened to some of the large and 
strong companies who supply Government.
In the short term, the situation may offer opportunities 
to companies such as Serco which have already 
re-financed their balance sheets and focused 
on developing the strength and depth of their 
management. But this is no time for schadenfreude. 
Serco’s interest lies in seeing the market restored 
to health as soon as possible, where suppliers have 
the confidence to invest in bringing innovation and 
efficiency to help Government rise to the challenges 
of providing what it so badly needs, which is more 
public services, of higher quality, at lower cost. And 
Government needs to feel confident that it has a choice 
of strong suppliers, who it can trust to deliver and stand 
by their promises, and who have balance sheets robust 
enough to sustain them through the lumps and bumps 
inherent in the delivery of large and complex contracts.
We believe that recent events present an opportunity 
for both Government and its suppliers to work together 
to construct a new approach to the provision of public 
services which will avoid the problems of the past. 
There is broad consensus that public service provision 
should be a mixed economy of the state, not-for-profit 
organisations, and the private sector; and also that the 
provision of public services should not be completely 
exposed to the harshest rough-and-tumble, boom-
and-bust cycle of a totally free market where the 
relative powers of either buyer or seller may become 
unbalanced. Few people believe that the delivery 
of public services should always be a monopoly of 
employees of the state. The question is a practical one 
of how to make the procurement of public services, 
whether delivered by the state itself, by not-for-profits, 
or private companies, work better.
Serco will be contributing energetically to this 
discussion, and we will be proposing four principles 
which we suggest should govern relations between 
Government and its suppliers, be they public bodies, 
not-for-profit organisations or private sector companies.
• We should strengthen transparency in public 
contracting. This means that for large contracts 
for public services, which are not commoditised, 
which do not impinge on National Security, and 
which do not include significant amounts of 
intellectual property, the presumption should be 
in favour of open-book accounting, in which the 
Cabinet Office and National Audit Office can see 
the suppliers’ accounts of major contracts, whether 
they be performed by public or private operators. 
There should also be far greater transparency of 
operational performance: except in exceptional 
circumstances, suppliers, be they private or 
Government-owned, should be required to publish 
Chief Executive's Review continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42 every six months their performance against key 
operational indicators, so they are held accountable 
for the delivery of their promises to the taxpayers 
who are paying for them and the users who they 
are serving. And we believe that there should be a 
formal, rigorous and transparent decision-making 
process by which Government decides what 
mechanism it should use, be it in-house or by a  
third party, to deliver a given project or policy.  
We call this the “Transparency Principle”.
• Both suppliers and the Government should have 
the right, on payment of an agreed break fee, to 
exit a contract at pre-determined intervals. We call 
this the “Orderly Exit Principle”. The purpose of this 
is to give both Government and supplier the ability to 
exit contracts which are not working out as intended. 
For instance, if the supplier is making greater than 
expected profits, or Government policy changes, 
or performance is unsatisfactory but still within the 
bounds of the contract, the Government should 
be able, on payment of a break fee, to re-compete 
or take back in-house the contract; and likewise 
if the supplier was making unexpected losses, or 
changes in regulation had made it impossible to 
deliver the contract as intended, the supplier can 
exit the contract on payment of a fee which would 
compensate the Government for the cost of re-
tendering. This would, for both Government and 
supplier, significantly reduce the risk of being stuck 
together in unhappy marriages.
• Suppliers of sensitive contracts should be obliged 
to lodge with Government a “living will”, being 
a set of arrangements to facilitate the transfer of a 
contract back to Government or to another supplier 
if required. This would significantly reduce the 
operational risk to Government of supplier failure. 
This is the “Security of Supply Principle”.
• Government and suppliers should agree to abide 
by a mutually-agreed code of conduct, which 
would set out expected standards of behaviour from 
Government and its contractors. This would involve 
the Government agreeing not to impose punitive or 
unfair terms and conditions or transfer unmanageable 
state risk; and suppliers would agree to maintain 
certain metrics of financial stability; pay their sub-
contractors in a timely fashion; and adequately fund 
their pensions. We think it would be important to 
have a process of independent arbitration built into 
the code of conduct to ensure that there is some 
avenue of redress and calling to account those 
who do not abide by the code. We call this the 
“Fairness Principle”.
It is vital to the well-being of any country that public 
services are delivered to high standards and offer 
value for money, and for the most part, in the UK, 
private and third-sector providers have done a 
good job of doing this. The UK has hundreds of 
new hospitals and schools, built and maintained 
to high standards; thousands of contracts have 
delivered innovation, improved services and lowered 
costs, along with far higher degrees of visibility of 
operational performance than is commonly available 
from public sector delivery. And as the UK advances 
towards Brexit, it is clear that there will be the need 
for a whole lot more Government as we “take back 
control”. With this in mind, we believe that there is 
an urgent need to re-think the relationship between 
the UK Government and its suppliers. We believe an 
approach based on the Four Principles above would 
serve to restore trust and common sense in the market; 
remove the risk of excessive profits or losses; and 
encourage a more vibrant and competitive market for 
Government services, one in which Serco would be an 
enthusiastic participant.
