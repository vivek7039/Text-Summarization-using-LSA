WHAT IS TELERADIOLOGY? WHAT WE DO
t eleradiology is the electronic transmission of 
radiological patient images, including plain film x-rays 
(pF), computerised tomography (ct ) scans and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, from one 
location to another, for the purposes of diagnostic 
interpretation and reporting. t hrough teleradiology, 
images can be transmitted from the hospital setting, 
where the images are created, to a radiologist who can 
review and report on the images remotely. In the case of 
Medica, these are c onsultant Radiologists specialising in 
the relevant field, who typically report on the image 
from their own home or from one of Medica’s dedicated 
reporting centres. t eleradiology improves patient care 
by enabling radiologists to provide their services 
remotely, thereby facilitating the rapid availability of 
trained specialists 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

HOW WE DO IT
Medica has a bespoke IT platform 
that provides market-leading 
linkage between a hospital’s 
Radiology Information System (RIS) 
and Consultant Radiologists who 
contract with Medica. 
t his link to the hospital RIs is a key 
advantage Medica has over 
competitors in the teleradiology 
market. t his unique linkage offers 
Medica’s contracted radiologists 
equivalence to n Hs in-house 
reporting by providing the same 
radiology history and previous 
images that an in-house radiologist 
would have access to.
What this means 
direct access to the hospital’s RIs 
system and thus to a patients’ 
historical clinical records allows 
Medica radiologists to give the most 
complete and accurate reports 
adhering to the highest standards, 
in the same way that the hospital-
based radiologist does.
Among other benefits, Medica offers 
hospital radiology departments the 
ability to manage their workflow 
more efficiently and flexibly, and 
provides rapid access to specialist 
c onsultant Radiologists, who may
not be available to that hospital at 
the relevant time, or at all.
