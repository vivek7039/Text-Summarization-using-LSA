Viability statement
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to introduce Vectura’s Annual Report for 2017.
The past year has been a mix of challenge and opportunity. 
Revenue growth was impacted by the delay in the approval of 
VR315 (US), the Group’s US generic Advair
®
 programme partnered 
with Hikma. Whilst this has had a significant impact on the share 
price, we should not let this overshadow the operational progress 
achieved by the Group during the year.
Operational performance and revenue growth
Underlying performance from our key in-market inhalation products 
was strong. The main growth drivers, flutiform
®
 and Ultibro
®
 
Breezhaler
®
, continued to perform well in competitive markets, 
growing net sales at 11.8%¹ and 20.6%
1
 respectively on a constant 
currency basis, when compared to calendar year 2016. 
The Group has reported strong underlying financial performance, 
preserving a strong balance sheet through a combination of existing 
royalty streams and disciplined investment in R&D. The Group’s 
2017 IFRS operating loss of £96.2m was driven by a full year, 
non-cash, amortisation and impairment charge of £109.7m from 
prior acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA
2
 of £25.8m is underpinned by 
key products flutiform
®
, Ultibro
® 
Breezhaler
®
 and Seebri
®
 Breezhaler
®
, 
which together delivered gross margin of £41.1m, up 18.8% on an 
underlying full year comparative basis, with flutiform
®
 supply chain 
gross margin up 6.2 percentage points to 37.6%. Adjusted EBITDA 
also benefited from R&D expenditure of £60.3m being at the lower 
end of the guidance range and the delivery of merger synergy 
savings and ongoing R&D transformation initiatives.
Vectura continued to make operational progress across its proprietary 
partnered programmes. The Breelib
TM
 device was approved and 
launched in Europe by our partner Bayer in April 2017 with positive 
patient feedback. This application of Vectura’s FOX
®
 smart nebuliser 
technology, from the Activaero acquisition, has enabled an almost 
one-hour reduction in the total daily treatment time for patients 
who are receiving treatment (iloprost) up to six times a day, a very 
meaningful improvement in patient quality of life. Whilst the financial 
benefit for Vectura from this product is modest, the validation of this 
important technology represents a significant milestone for the 
Group. The approval and subsequent commercialisation have opened 
up the possibility for multiple new valuable and relatively low-risk 
development programmes combining the device with known 
molecules, which are now under feasibility review. 
Vectura’s lead wholly owned programme in severe adult asthma 
patients, VR475 (EU), completed Phase III recruitment and the trial 
is due to complete in Q4 2018. The first patient in the Phase II trial 
for paediatric asthma, VR647 (US), was dosed in December 2017 
and this trial is due to complete in Q3 2018.
We are uniquely positioned  
for future growth 9 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
STRATEGIC REPORT
Vectura is one of the few companies able to develop complex inhaled 
generics and overcome the strict regulatory barriers imposed by 
the FDA and EMA. During the year we announced a collaboration 
with Sandoz to develop VR2081, a pMDI generic for the US, and 
the licensing of technology from Pulmatrix, initially to support the 
development of VR410, a tiotropium DPI generic. As a result, the 
Group’s pipeline now includes the current three largest US generic 
opportunities. In March 2018, Hikma confirmed that the dispute 
resolution process for VR315 (US) had concluded with the FDA upholding 
its original decision with a requirement that Hikma completes an 
additional Clinical Endpoint study. Hikma anticipates being able to 
submit a response to the FDA with new clinical data as early as 
possible in 2019, with a potential approval and launch during 2020.
An Operational Excellence review of the Vectura R&D function 
was performed during the year and a number of opportunities to 
significantly enhance productivity were identified. These will free 
up capacity to support future project development and achieve cost 
reductions. These activities are a priority for implementation in 2018. 
In November 2017 the Board also approved a share buyback and 
cancellation programme to return up to £15m of capital to shareholders. 
This programme, which completed post period, is an efficient 
allocation of capital as part of our ongoing strong financial management 
discipline and demonstrates the Board’s confidence in the cash 
generation of the business. 
Merger integration and synergy realisation
The post-merger organisation structure was implemented early in 
2017 and all priority integration initiatives have been completed. 
As announced in September 2017, we are on track to deliver £11m 
to £12m synergies by the end of 2018, with the majority of the 
savings being realised in 2017.
2018 business strategy 
In the latter part of 2017 the Group completed a full review of its 
R&D investment strategy and this was communicated to the market 
on 4 January 2018. The following decisions were made: 
• investment in relatively high-risk novel molecules at early stage 
will end and opportunities to partner remaining programmes 
will be sought; 
• the Group will be more selective in identifying co-development 
programmes of novel molecules, focusing only on highly 
profitable and significant opportunities; and 
• Vectura will seek to develop further high-potential generic medicines 
for the US market, in association with well-established partners. 
This serves to increase the Group’s focus on relatively lower-risk 
high-value development programmes, ultimately optimising the return 
on our R&D developments. In addition, it was decided that, in the 
absence of additional specialist marketed products being acquired, 
through M&A or licensing, the Group will initiate partnering discussions 
for VR475 (EU) and VR647 (US), following the completion of their 
respective current Phase III and Phase II activities.
Governance 
As a Board, we are committed to the principles of good corporate 
governance and we have continued to comply with the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) throughout the year 
and to the date of this report. Through a robust internal framework 
of systems and controls, we strive to maintain the highest standards. 
Full details can be found in the Corporate governance report on 
pages 70 to 78.
Board changes
In December 2017, we welcomed Juliet Thompson as a new 
Independent Non-Executive Director. Upon appointment, Juliet also 
became a member of the Audit Committee and was appointed a 
member of the Remuneration Committee. Her extensive understanding 
of the healthcare industry and experience in corporate finance bring 
important insight to Board discussions, as well as supplementing 
and strengthening the existing skills and experience of the Board. 
Juliet’s appointment also signals the Board's and Vectura’s commitment 
to increased diversity up and down the organisation. Full details 
on succession planning can be found in the Nomination Committee 
report on page 79.
People and culture 
The Group has a highly talented workforce with an invaluable diversity 
of proven capabilities, knowledge and experience. During the year, 
the Executive Leadership Team led a Company-wide project to 
identify and deliver a shared culture comprised of the values 
and behaviours which make our Company distinctive. This initiative 
is of paramount importance to the Board because it underpins 
Vectura’s ability to deliver its product pipeline and to innovate. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank each one of our employees 
for their continued commitment and excellent contributions during the 
past year.
Shareholders 
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued support 
following the delay with VR315 (US). The Board remains confident 
in the approvability of this product. With a newly renewed pipeline 
focus and commitment to Operational Excellence, our mission is 
clear: delivery, simplification and focus. We remain committed to 
growing an innovative and differentiated business which delivers 
shareholder value. 
Outlook
The Board sees Vectura as being a highly competitive business 
with strong underlying revenues from our in-market products. 
The business is differentiated by its unique set of capabilities, 
as medicines in the respiratory space become more complicated. 
Vectura is one of the few companies globally with the expertise to 
formulate and deliver the most complex products for inhaled delivery. 
I look forward with optimism as we work towards successful 
outcomes from developing our refocused pipeline and believe 
the Group is increasingly well positioned to achieve its ambition 
of becoming the industry-leading inhaled drug-device development 
specialist, delivering significant value for our shareholders.
