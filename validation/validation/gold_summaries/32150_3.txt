 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We are pleased to report continued growth both in 
market share and company scale, driven by strong 
operating and financial performance. 
Our significant growth in billings and free cash flow 
over the previous financial year was driven by ongoing 
investment in organic and acquired product innovation. 
This growth continues to fuel a strengthening talent 
pool and an extended reach of our selling and 
marketing operations.
Cybersecurity remains a top priority for organisations 
of every size, and our rigorous focus on delivering 
enterprise-grade IT security to mid-market enterprises 
via the channel that serves them differentiates and 
strongly positions Sophos in the enormous and growing 
global IT security market. This past year we have made 
strong progress against our strategic goals in both our 
enduser and network security offerings. We have added 
significant customer value and expanded our market 
opportunity across our product lines through numerous 
product enhancements and additions, including through 
Sophos Central, our rapidly growing born-in-the-cloud 
offering. As we look ahead, we have a robust product 
roadmap, with planned offerings that will incorporate 
next-generation machine learning and artificial 
intelligence technologies, which will further differentiate 
Sophos and strengthen the value we deliver to our 
customers and channel partners. 
We have also strengthened our Board by welcoming 
two highly qualified UK-based global executives as 
independent non-executive directors. 
Vin Murria joined our Board in January and serves on 
our nomination and remuneration committees. Vin 
is a successful entrepreneur with strong operational 
leadership experience in growing UK-based global 
technology businesses and associated shareholder 
value. Rick Medlock joined our Board in April, bringing 
more than thirty years of experience in the financial 
management of large international technology 
companies in the UK and US. Rick also serves on 
our nomination, remuneration and audit and risk 
committees. Rick will be appointed Chairman of the audit 
and risk committee at the next Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”). 
Ed Gillis, our current Chairman of the audit and risk 
committee, will be retiring from our Board at the 
upcoming AGM after eight years of service. We thank 
Ed for his very active and impactful leadership and for 
a strong foundation that Rick Medlock will now carry 
forward. 
FY17 has demonstrated the strength of our offerings 
as well as our capacity to execute on our strategy. As 
a result, we feel very encouraged about our ability to 
continue our growth and profitability trends. 
On behalf of our Board, we thank our Sophos employee 
team all around the world for your tireless dedication 
and good work to serve our customers, our partners, 
and our shareholders. We thank our customers and 
partners for your much-valued business and confidence 
in our capabilities throughout our journey together. 
Finally, we say ‘thank you’ to our investors for the trust 
you have placed in Sophos. We appreciate your support, 
and we will continue to work hard to earn your 
continued trust.

THE DEMAND FOR SECURITY SOLUTIONS CONTINUES TO 
GROW. THIS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE WORLD AND ACROSS 
ORGANISATIONS OF ALL SIZES. INDUSTRY ANALYSTS PREDICT 
THAT THE GLOBAL IT SECURITY MARKET1 WILL BE IN EXCESS OF 
$39B IN 2017, REACHING AN ESTIMATED $48B BY 2020... 
THREAT LANDSCAPE
The 2016 threat landscape was dominated by two 
themes: state-sponsored hacking and cyberwarfare at 
the global level; and the specific threats of ransomware 
and phishing at the local business level.
These themes demonstrated the challenges that face 
all businesses worldwide – attacks can be targeted, 
sustained and highly sophisticated, and they can be 
opportunistic and random. Cybercrime has reached an 
industrial scale and continues to be lucrative.
While the headlines were consumed with high profile 
hacking, customers and partners across the world 
highlighted ransomware and phishing threats as the 
biggest challenge to maintaining security. An increasing 
amount of ransomware intercepted by SophosLabs was 
now seen to be targeting mobile devices, 
especially Android. 
Finding vulnerabilities and exploits on new platforms 
and devices continued. This year the security research 
communities concerns about inherent insecurity in 
internet of things (“IoT”) devices became reality after 
the Mirai assault against one of several companies 
hosting the Domain Name System (“DNS”). That 
denial of service attack affected some of the highest 
profile media, social media and commercial payment 
platforms, in turn impacting millions of users worldwide.
While these new vectors of attack were exploited, 
high profile brands disclosed data breaches dating 
back to 2013, demonstrating how challenging it is to 
identify and investigate breaches at even the most 
sophisticated technology-based companies. Indeed, we 
also heard reports of an alleged auction of hacking tools 
stolen from the US National Security Agency. The year 
ended with allegations of nation-state involvement in 
the leak of emails during the US election, serving as 
a reminder to all that the threat from highly 
sophisticated, well-coordinated and well-funded 
attackers is a new normal.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
The current geo-political landscape in Europe and 
the US will have an ongoing effect on regulations 
and government legislation related to privacy, data 
protection and cyber-security. As the UK moves towards 
Brexit, we anticipate clarification on the regulations 
affecting UK businesses and expect them to remain 
largely in line with the current legislation, as much of the 
EU proposals are built on UK requirements.
There is currently a heightened focus on cybersecurity 
and nation-sate sponsored activity in the US and 
increased collaboration is anticipated between private 
industry and government agencies in the protection of 
US citizens’ data and privacy.
The Investigatory Powers Act that was ratified by the 
UK government in December 2016 continues to remain 
under scrutiny and was most recently declared unlawful 
by the European Court of Justice. 
The EU Data Protection regulation (“GDPR”) will take 
effect at the end of 2017 and companies holding data 
on citizens within the EU will accelerate their readiness 
for it. It has numerous components, but one key 
takeaway is that European businesses will now be held 
responsible for the protection of the data they process, 
including cloud providers and other third parties. 
Indeed, regulatory pressures are here to stay and 
companies must continue to invest resources to 
ensure compliance.
