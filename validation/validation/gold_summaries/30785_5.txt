 Q&A with CEO, David Miles
92%
of tenants rated our Housing 
Service as excellent in 2017
What’s next?
How have you performed against 
your strategic priorities? 
We have continued to grow our broader housing expertise, 
with Mears playing an ever increasing role in helping clients 
shape their placemaking plans. Our established repairs and 
maintenance capability delivers market-leading service 
levels and has been complemented by our growing range of 
services housing management that help address the rising 
homelessness issues that exist. We have also been asked, by 
a growing number of clients, to build affordable housing, 
given our extensive knowledge as to how to create homes 
that are then efficient to repair and maintain on an ongoing 
basis. Our Care division has, as forecast, improved its 
performance, returning to profitability, and has been put on a 
more sustainable footing. It is also pleasing to see increasing 
joint working across Care and Housing to facilitate the 
provision and management of more specialist housing, 
reflecting the changing demographics in the UK. We would 
have liked to have secured more repairs and maintenance 
work in the year , but we have not compromised our position 
and only bid for work where we are confident that our service 
standards can be achieved, at a sustainable pricing level. We 
will not make the mistakes that some of our competitors 
have made.
Where do you see the opportunities going forward?
We see growth in both the housing and care sectors, as 
both central and local Government funding increases in 
these areas (see Market Report on page 12). Importantly 
our broader range of Housing services will enable us to 
bid for the size of contract that would have previously 
been out of our reach. These are very large opportunities 
that will come to market in 2018 and 2019. Shortages 
of affordable housing will continue to mean significant 
opportunity for our housing management division, in the 
short, medium and long term. Mears has quickly become 
market leader in this field.
 How have you changed the structure of Mears to 
reflect the broader range of solutions for clients?
We continue to invest in a strong Housing and Care leadership 
team. Significant additional resource has been brought 
into housing management, given the growth here. We 
have, however, created simple, relatively flat structures, 
focusing on ensuring good teamwork across the Group. 
It was pleasing to see the results of our employee survey 
at the end of 2017, to which 83% of staff responded and 
which illustrated a growing recognition across the Group 
of the improvements that have been made in communication, 
team working and training and development. This result is 
in no small part down to the structure of the organisation 
and the quality of leadership. This is not an area where we 
can afford to stand still and we expect to make further 
improvements in 2018.
Sustainability and corporate social responsibility 
have always been an important part of the Mears 
ethos; do you see that continuing?
We are very proud of our achievements made in this area 
and our commitment to this will not change. Please read 
how we delivered social value in 2017 on pages 41 to 47. 
We were also pleased to get a very high rating against the 
FTSE4Good Index, which looked across a range of areas, 
benchmarking our approach to corporate responsibility 
versus our peers. As a national Social Mobility Champion 
and leading employer of apprentices along with our 
commitments to supporting women into the trades 
and promotion of better working terms for care workers, 
I am proud to lead such a great organisation. Importantly, 
these commitments are not only ethically right, they are 
fundamental to our business model.
How is new technology being utilised  
to improve service and efficiency?
We have led the way for many years in using technology to 
enhance both the service and cost efficiency of our Housing 
services. The detail behind every job is captured on our 
housing system, with handheld technology fully utilised 
to communicate, schedule, cost and monitor every job that 
we undertake. We are now testing technology in tenants’ 
housing that will give early warning as to potential repair 
needs, for example for boiler systems and we see further 
opportunities in this space. Within Care we have committed 
to a single system, again backed up by handheld technology , 
that has many of the benefits we see on the housing side. 
As with Housing, we are also using technology in people’s 
homes to help deliver positive care outcomes, including 
tackling increasing issues such as social isolation. Mears, 
of course, remains a people business, but technology helps 
people carry out their work more effectively and enables 
customers to communicate more efficiently. We have also 
created a powerful insight tool that, at a very local level, 
provides data on a range of important criteria, such as 
demographics, housing availability, health and crime, 
all of which can help our decision making throughout 
our operations and our social value work.
