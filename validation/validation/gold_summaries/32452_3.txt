 STRATEGIC REPORT
Chairman’s statement
WE HAVE SET OURSELVES 
A GOAL TO ACCRETE VALUE 
BY CREATING A LEADING 
BIOMA TERIALS BUSINESS AND 
WE BELIEVE THE MOMENTUM FOR 
ACHIEVING THIS IS INCREASING.”
I am pleased to present Collagen Solutions’ annual report and 
accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
Strategy
Earlier in the year we committed to a strategic plan to accelerate 
our business growth and enhance shareholder value by both 
developing our core business and commercialising the investment 
in our proprietary device programmes. In March, we secured up 
to £10.8 million in funding by way of a placing and open offer of 
£6.8 million and a venture debt facility of up to £4.0 million, which 
will provide the resources to deliver a targeted increase in revenue 
of five times in the five years to 2021. Our commercial and R&D 
teams have been strengthened in the past year to execute on 
these plans over the coming years.
Innovation and IP
We have continued to invest in the proprietary product 
pipeline, in particular in ChondroMimetic
®
, an exciting cartilage 
repair technology based around a bilayered collagen sponge. 
Manufacturing validations have commenced in Glasgow, and 
significant work has been undertaken in preparation for the 
CE mark submission, which will be delayed slightly as a result of 
a Board decision to secure as many patients as possible from the 
original clinical trial conducted in Budapest in 2009. To that end 
we have secured patient consent from 15 out of the original 17 
with the other two having moved out of Hungary making it 
logistically difficult for them to participate. This new trial, which is 
technically known as an open-label extension trial, will provide 
us with seven to eight years of longitudinal data which, if positive, 
will help enormously with our partnering activities. 
Our other key projects are in wound healing and in bone graft 
substitutes, where we have filed for a provisional patent. We remain 
confident about our ability to partner these products, although the 
increasing burden of regulation has resulted in extended timelines.
Our collaborations with various academic and industry partners 
include our participation in two prestigious European Horizon 
2020 consortiums to develop: (i) a disease-modifying therapy for 
Parkinson’s which could slow down the progression of the disease 
rather than offering symptomatic benefits; and (ii) cell-based 
tissue regeneration techniques.
Board and management
During the year we have made a number of key appointments 
to strengthen the executive team. Kevin Darling joined us in 
October as General Manager, New Zealand, taking over the reins 
from Geoff Bennett, who, in January, moved from his previous 
executive director position to become a non-executive director. 
In February, we appointed Brad Selman to the role of VP Global 
Sales and Marketing to lead our commercial team and in March, 
Chris Wattengel joined the team as VP Global R&D to lead our 
product development programmes. 
Co-founder Dr Stewart White stepped down from the Board on 
30 June 2017, but will remain in a consultancy role and continue 
to participate as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board. 
I personally would like to thank Stewart for all his

8 hard work and what we have achieved together in the growth of 
the business to date, and I look forward to continued interaction 
via his continued membership of the Scientific Advisory Board.
The Board is confident that we now have a team in place to 
deliver the short to medium-term strategic goals and have also 
strengthened our functional teams to drive product innovation 
and take the business to the next level of growth.
Our people
As part of our vital initiatives for the coming year we are committed to 
providing development opportunities for our employees and have 
been working with them on individual employee development plans 
to deliver the required targeted training to allow them to deliver 
enhanced performance to the business in its growth phase. We value 
feedback from our employees and carry out an annual survey to 
measure our performance in this area.
Overview
Our Board and management team have continued to make positive 
progress, delivering nine new commercial agreements, with strong 
sales growth in Asia, where we established a regional sales office 
in Seoul, and in Europe. We have also seen an increase in demand 
for tissue biomaterials from our Australian and New Zealand 
sources. The investment in the multi-purpose processing facility 
in New Zealand last year has allowed product development and 
prototyping to be carried out, which will generate further revenues 
in the coming year. The quality of the customer pipeline is building 
up with some interesting projects to be executed.
We continue to put in place the clear organisation and detailed 
initiatives to drive our focused strategy in the current financial year 
and beyond, which is to build a leading global regenerative biomaterials 
business based upon a core supply, development and manufacturing 
platform, enhanced by developing our own novel products, such as 
ChondroMimetic
®
, across a range of clinical indications. The funding 
secured in March allows us to implement these initiatives and we 
will continue to strengthen our core business through operational 
improvements and investing in innovation to create significant value. 
Our activities in entering the Chinese market continue with Cre8ive, 
where we have been successful in achieving initial shipments 
of product via our import agents and are in discussion with 
potential customers.
We have set ourselves a goal to accrete value by creating a leading 
biomaterials business through a combination of organic growth 
and exploitation of our own and licensed IP, as well as through 
appropriate acquisitions, and we believe the momentum for 
achieving this is increasing.
Results
The Group’s results for the year ended 31 March 2017 are set out in 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and discussed 
further in the Financial Review.
Outlook
The past year has seen significant change in the business 
and we expect the current year will be no different in terms of the 
speed and magnitude of progress. We are an ambitious company with 
ambitious targets and the agenda for the coming year reflects both the 
opportunities that we have identified and the associated challenges.
Our key targets for the current year are as follows:
• 
We have a multitude of development milestones amongst the high 
value product portfolio and we will seek to progress further projects 
into development. ChondroMimetic
®
 is the most advanced such 
project and we expect to complete the open-label extension study 
in Hungary for the 15 identified patients. We expect an ever-greater 
contribution to the value of the business from these projects as 
they approach commercialisation.
• 
Based on a successful outcome to the aforementioned 
ChondroMimetic
®
 study we aim to secure the most appropriate 
partner who, in an ideal world, would give us global commercial 
access for the ChondroMimetic
®
 product. More likely is a partnering 
arrangement that will be for Europe and the rest of the world, 
excluding the US, but with an option to commercialise the 
product in the US where the regulatory authorities will demand 
that the product goes down the pre-market approval route. 
Given the significant cost of this regulatory pathway, we would 
expect these costs to be met by the partner.
• 
Achieving continued revenue growth across all our key territories 
and to seek to address a specific risk with a Korean customer 
on potential reduced quantities at contract renewal, which could 
possibly impact 18/19 revenues if not addressed this year. As 
you would expect and hope for, we are at an advanced stage 
of mitigating this risk by discussing new product categories 
and services with the customer as well as leveraging our 
market reach to help accelerate their sales.
• 
Forging the most mutually beneficial arrangement with Cre8ive, 
our partner in China. We continue to examine a number of potential 
options for a route forward and hopefully we will be able to arrive 
at the best option soon. The work we have done in the past year 
has underlined the potential for our medical-grade collagen sourced 
from Australia and New Zealand. This differentiator gives us a clear 
advantage over local Chinese producers where environmental 
factors such as heavy metal contamination alone can impact 
the quality of the product.
• 
To successfully execute the relocation of our San Jose R&D 
facility and ensure the transfer to a new facility in Minneapolis.
• 
The Company is keen to reflect its ambition by contemplating 
potential transactions which could help deliver critical mass in its 
core business and access additional products and technology which 
will be accretive to future commercial plans for high-value products. 
We will continue to review such opportunities as they arise.
I continue to be very committed to ensuring Collagen Solutions 
is a success and continue to be assured by:
• 
the quality of the people we have at Collagen Solutions and the 
fact that we have been able to attract into the Company people 
of a very high calibre;
• 
the quality of our current product offering and our development;
• 
the continued support of the Board to our strategic plan; and
• 
the continued support of yourselves as shareholders.
Finally, last year I referred to us being on a journey. In the past year, 
I feel that we have travelled a long way and I believe that in the next 
year we will travel even further. Hopefully as a shareholder you 
will see this better reflected in our share price.
