Progress towards the creation of

centre and cloud services
Dear Shareholder
We are reporting another period of strategic and operational 
progress and remain focused on continuing to reposition the 
business as a provider of fibre-enabled services and IP-based 
solutions. Our fibre deployment in Hull and East Yorkshire 
remains on schedule to reach 150,000 premises by December 
2017 and we continue to see high levels of customer take-up. 
In Enterprise, we have strengthened our sales, delivery 
management and technical capability to respond quickly 
to customer demand and create a scalable operating model 
as that demand grows.
Our business is focused on three distinct market segments.
Hull and East Yorkshire: a stable, income-generating segment 
focused on our regional market. Our plan here is to grow 
through continued broadband penetration and the introduction 
of additional services that exploit our continued investment 
in the market leading fibre network.
Enterprise: our engine for future growth. Our focus is to grow 
scale and capability in the provision of complex IP-related 
communications and IT solutions to the Enterprise market.
National Network Services: our national, connectivity-based 
segment, where we seek to maximise the value from our legacy 
investment in national network infrastructure with a tight focus 
on the mid-market’s need for connectivity-based services.

Strategic report
Progress
At the beginning of the financial year, we aligned all of our 
business activities under a single brand. This is enabling us to 
simplify the way we work and to adapt the size and skills of our 
teams in support of our core markets. We strengthened our 
management team at Group level and across our Enterprise 
segment to help to align the business behind our core market 
strategy and to drive performance.
As we indicated at the half year, we have tightened our focus on 
the two segments (Hull and East Yorkshire and Enterprise) that 
provide sustainable opportunities for the business in terms of 
delivering dividend support and future growth in overall 
shareholder value. 
The disposal of certain national network assets last year was a 
fundamental part of this repositioning. The proceeds received from 
this sale are being re-invested in the deployment of fibre in Hull and 
East Yorkshire and continuing the transformation of the business.
During the second half of the year we analysed our shared costs in 
order to allocate them more appropriately to our market segments. 
This improved insight is helping us to optimise our cost base 
going forward. 
Hull and East Yorkshire
In our Hull and East Yorkshire segment, our focus is on exploiting 
the value from the continuing investment in our network, 
particularly our ultra-fast fibre capability, through the introduction 
of quad-play services to consumers and additional network-based 
services to businesses. We have a total of approximately 145,000 
consumer and business customers in this segment. 
Demand for our fibre broadband across both business and 
consumer markets has remained high during the year with 
average take-up rates in excess of 30 per cent, where our fibre 
is available and we remain on target to make those services 
available to more than two thirds of premises by December 2017. 
Building on this fibre capability, towards the end of the calendar 
year, we plan to introduce an innovative approach to a TV 
proposition, which importantly will provide also the platform for 
further in-home ‘over the top’ content services and applications.
The anticipated decline in revenue generated from our contact 
centre and media services has continued and we expect this 
contribution to further reduce over the next year. 
Enterprise
Our best growth opportunity is within our Enterprise segment 
providing IT and integration services to UK-based enterprises. 
We have a primary focus on the development and support of 
IP-based solutions and services and have particular skills and 
experience in taking complex multi-location on-premise call 
centres to the cloud. This growing market for Contact Centres 
as a Service and professional cloud deployment for enterprises 
should mean that our Enterprise segment continues to develop 
as an asset light business with strong margins. 
This segment represents the biggest opportunity for growth and we 
remain optimistic about future progress and our ability to exploit the 
opportunities available. Current customers include Bupa, HMRC, Rail 
Delivery Group and Shoosmiths and each has grown from its initial 
contract size. New business has been signed with clients across a 
range of sectors, including Hastings Direct (Insurance), C Hoare & Co 
(Financial Services) and Dugout (Entertainment). 
The growth in our IP solutions activity is encouraging and the 
potential for this continues to develop, exploiting our unique 
combination of capabilities across cloud, internet, IT and 
communications. While we have seen early signs of revenue 
growth in this segment, margins were held back in the year, as 
we recognised the impact of incurred and anticipated cost 
overruns on the development stages of two fixed price, complex 
software implementations for a single customer. We continue to 
maintain a strong relationship with the customer, which we 
expect to continue to grow successfully. 
Following those early successes and the valuable experience 
we have gained in their implementation, we have invested in 
strengthening our sales leadership and delivery capabilities, 
including flexible resourcing systems and resource pooling. 
We expect these actions to result in a stronger pipeline of 
opportunities and margin expansion in the coming year. 
National Network Services
Our National Network Services segment focuses on delivering 
connectivity-based services to national organisations in both the 
direct and indirect market. 
This segment seeks to maximise the value of our historical 
investment in national network platforms and, while we expect 
overall revenues to decline in this segment as a number of legacy 
contracts come to an end, there are some areas of this market in 
which we can compete without the need for substantial investment. 
Primarily this is in the provision of multi-site wide area networks and 
other associated services. Existing customers for such services 
include RNLI, One Stop, Furniture Village and Domino’s.
We continue to seek ways to limit the effect of the decline and 
explore other solutions as appropriate.
Outlook
Evidenced by the progress made over the past year, the Board is 
confident in the transition of KCOM into a regional fibre-based 
services provider and a provider of complex IP solutions to the 
Enterprise market. We remain focused on creating a simplified 
business, with a cost base better aligned to the growth 
opportunities in our core markets, that the Board believes 
will generate long-term sustainable returns and growth for 
shareholders. Whilst we expect to make further progress in both 
Hull and East Yorkshire and Enterprise, as we transition away from 
commoditised services, we expect there to be a further decline 
in revenues and margins associated with our legacy activities. 
Consistent with our existing commitment to a minimum full year 
dividend of 6.00p per share, the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 4.00p per share, subject to shareholder approval at 
the company’s Annual General Meeting on 21 July 2017.
