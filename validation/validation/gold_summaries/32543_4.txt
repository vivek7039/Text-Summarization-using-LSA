 Chain
A global market leading supplier of chain for many applications. 
Heavy duty, high precision, indoor or outdoor, high or low 
temperature and in clean or contaminated environments; these are 
all in a day’s work. We have manufacturing sites across the world 
including the USA, Germany, India, China, Malaysia and Australia in 
addition to local service capabilities in a number of other markets. 
We operate at the leading edge of technology, with innovative 
products designed to meet customers’ exacting standards.
Our vast range of roller chains means that for most requirements 
there is a Renold solution. Our premier brand, Renold Synergy, 
offers unbeatable wear and fatigue performance, whilst our all-
purpose range of standard chain provides affordable reliability. 
Continuous research, development, innovation and ingenuity has 
led to the production of more specialised solutions such as Hydro-
Service with its superior corrosion-resistant coating and the Syno 
range which sets a new benchmark for chains requiring little or no 
lubrication. 
Conveyor chain applications including theme park rides, water 
treatment plants, cement mills, agricultural machinery, mining and 
sugar production all rely on the high-specification materials and 
processes used by Renold. Renold is also a market leader in leaf 
chain used in many of the forklift trucks produced worldwide.
Our high specification Tooth Chain (sometimes known as silent 
chain) produces a wide range of inverted Tooth Chain for drives 
and for conveying applications. Offering a high degree of economic 
efficiency and reliability, Tooth Chain applications are wide ranging 
and include glass production and automobile assembly lines.
