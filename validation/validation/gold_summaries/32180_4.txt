Where we operate 
The business has traditionally focused 
on East London, but the need for new 
homes is so great that we have recently 
expanded our horizons across a wider area. 
Telford Homes is skilled in all aspects of 
London development and we can apply our 
knowledge and expertise to a wider range  
of opportunities in new boroughs. 
We develop in non-prime locations to 
maintain an affordable price point for our 
individual customers and our strategic move 
into build to rent provides scope to work 
with investment partners across London.
