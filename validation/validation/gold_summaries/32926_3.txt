CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
DON ELGIE
NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN
2017 has been a pivotal year for 
our business in which we fully 
aligned our operations to focus 
on cybersecurity software.
Introduction
2017 has been a pivotal year for 
our business in which we fully 
aligned our operations to focus 
on cybersecurity software. 
Our management team has worked 
tirelessly to deliver on our stated 
growth objectives which has now 
culminated in the renaming and 
rebranding of the business to Kape 
Technologies plc (previously 
Crossrider plc), an important 
milestone in the repositioning of the 
business. Since October 2016, the 
Company has focused on both 
acquiring and developing 
cybersecurity software solutions for 
consumers, whilst utilising its 
proprietary digital distribution 
technology to grow its user base 
across the Company’s product suite. 
The Company’s management has 
deployed Kape’s in-depth expertise 
and technological capabilities within 
its digital marketing platform to 
support and grow our expanded 
customer base and promote our own 
products and services. This market 
leading digital pedigree has enabled 
the Group to accelerate the Company’s 
successful transformation during 2017. 
Products 
In the last year, management has 
taken great strides to broaden our 
product stack, which includes our 
Reimage software and DriverAgent 
solutions. In March 2017, we acquired 
CyberGhost, a cybersecurity SaaS 
provider with specific focus on the 
provision of virtual private network 
(“VPN”) solutions, as well as a sizeable 
customer base. With CyberGhost now 
fully integrated into the Group, I am 
pleased to report it has performed 
ahead of management’s expectations 
both on a revenue and profit level.
In addition, and as part of the 
expansion into new products, the 
Company has launched Reimage for 
Mac, expanding the product’s 
potential customer base. 
We continue to experience positive 
customer traction across all our 
products, further demonstrating our 
ability to successfully leverage our 
expertise and digital marketing platform 
in order to drive higher margins. 3

Strategic priorities 
Our management team remains 
committed to delivering sustainable 
growth and is therefore focused on 
the following key strategic priorities: 
• to develop the Company’s product 
offering organically through internal 
R&D and to grow our user base across 
the Company’s growing portfolio of 
software products, leveraging Kape’s 
proprietary distribution technology 
and expertise; 
• to continue to implement our plan 
for new acquisitions that expand 
both the Company’s product 
offering and reach, with the 
potential to enter additional 
complementary sector verticals; 
and
• to grow the Company’s recurring 
revenue stream by gradually 
transitioning to a fully SaaS-based 
model, which will improve both the 
visibility and quality of earnings, as 
well as increasing the lifetime value 
of our customers. 
Board appointments 
In February 2017, the Company 
appointed Moran Laufer, Chief 
Financial Officer of Kape, to the Board 
of the Company. Moran has been a key 
member of the Company’s 
management, supporting its recent 
acquisitions as well as being part of 
the finance team since 2012, 
successfully supporting the Group’s 
admission to AIM in 2014. 
Looking forward
Kape’s management has been 
successful in demonstrating its ability 
to both drive organic growth initiatives 
alongside maximising the benefits 
from strategic acquisitions. 
The Board is therefore confident that 
with its new brand positioning, strategic 
growth priorities and ongoing focus 
on consumer cybersecurity, Kape will 
be able to continue to maximise 
shareholder value. 
The Board remains confident in 
delivering year-on-year growth in 2018.
