Highlights
Outlook
Taking advantage of the rapid changes 
in media and marketing – driven by 
changes in technology, consumer 
behaviour, and data – requires players 
in the industry to adjust their business 
models. As many of our clients and 
partners have embarked on this journey, 
so have we. The sale of the Advertising 
Intelligence business now better 
focuses Ebiquity on service areas 
offering structural market growth. 
The actions that have been taken in 
2017, has positioned the business for 
faster revenue growth in 2018 and 
beyond. With an expectation of a 
turnaround in performance in the US in 
2018, together with continued revenue 
growth outside of the US, we remain 
confident of delivering against the 
financial goals we set out in the 
Growth Acceleration Plan.
 
Michael Karg, CEO, commented:
“ 2017 was a year of change for Ebiquity. 
The planned sale of the Advertising 
Intelligence business, in particular, 
was significant and resource intensive. 
While our financial performance was 
held back by disappointing results in the 
US, we achieved important milestones 
on our multi-year transformational 
journey. The underlying changes that 
we are driving throughout our business 
are designed to align our services with 
client-side trends – as well as 
competitive dynamics – which provide 
mid- to long-term growth 
opportunities. 
We are positioning Ebiquity to become 
the preferred, independent adviser to 
marketers at world-leading brands. 
We have a clear, focused and 
differentiated destination and are 
implementing the relevant changes to 
get these, now and going forward.”
