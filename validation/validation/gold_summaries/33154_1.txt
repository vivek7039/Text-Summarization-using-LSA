  Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15
Strategic report
Group Chief Executive’s Statement 
5 
I am very proud to be reporting on the first year of the newly 
merged Dixons Carphone Group. In eleven months we have 
established the new organisational structures of the Group,  
UK & Ireland, and Sweden, rolled out almost 250 Carphone 
Warehouse SWAS, exited retail operations in Germany and the 
Netherlands, signed material contracts in Connected World 
Services, and launched a new MVNO in the UK under the iD 
brand. More importantly, during this time we have also 
delivered very strong trading, taken market share in all 
territories and delivered record customer satisfaction right 
across the business. 
The business has also had a strong first year financially. We 
have delivered PBT ahead of guidance, increasing pro forma 
Headline PBT from £316 million to £381 million, resulting in  
an increase in pro forma Headline basic EPS from 20.5p to 
25.5p. Pro forma net debt is also lower than expectation at 
£260 million. 
In the UK & Ireland, like-for-like sales were up 8% (13% in Q4) 
and EBIT grew by 26% to £306 million, reflecting strong 
performances in both electricals and mobile. In electricals, 
white goods and TVs sold particularly well with customers 
responding to our range, pricing and - above all - service 
initiatives. Our mobile business in the UK & Ireland also saw 
very encouraging sales growth. Postpay volumes and market 
share continued to grow year-on-year in relatively quiet 
markets as the business benefited from the exit of Phones 4u 
and successful product launches. We are also - cautiously - 
encouraged by the impact on ARPU from higher levels of  
data usage.  
Also in the UK, we launched our new MVNO, iD, in May. 
Enabled by an innovative IT platform, it will target a number  
of specific customer segments, with a particular focus on 
personalising plans with flexible tariffs and introducing shared 
data tariffs, market-leading roaming and the re-introduction of - 
already very popular - 12 month contracts. iD will also be 
launching in Ireland later in the summer.  
Our Nordics business had a good year with like-for-like sales 
up 4%. EBIT declined in sterling by 16% to £86 million but this 
was largely due to the devaluation of the Norwegian Kroner 
(£11 million). We have a very strong business in the Nordics and 
continue to gain share in all key markets. We continue to focus 
on pricing and new product and service offerings, such as our 
‘epoq’ kitchen range and the rollout of KNOWHOW. In Sweden 
we are building a cutting edge small box distribution centre to 
support the growth of multi-channel throughout the Nordics 
and across the region we are expanding our range of private 
label products. We believe that these and many other initiatives 
will continue to drive profitable growth in the years to come. 
Like-for-like sales in Southern Europe were down 5%, but 
exited the year up 8% in Q4. EBIT grew 40% to £14 million.  
As you are aware, this has been a time of some fluidity in the 
political and economic situation in Greece. Nevertheless, 
Kotsovolos gained significant market share and exited the year 
back in profitability for the first time in 5 years. What the future 
holds in the immediate term is necessarily less certain, but with 
a really excellent team and a strong market position, we feel 
that this situation may end up proving the aphorism that all 
crisis leads to opportunity.  Meanwhile, the market in Spain 
remains tough, but our stores saw improved trading during  
the final quarter boosted by the distribution of Movistar quad 
play offerings.  
In December we announced that we plan to deliver at least our 
synergy target of £80 million by financial year 2016/17- one 
year ahead of plan. The integration continues to progress well. 
During the year we have announced our joint UK head office 
and moved into one head office in both Sweden and Ireland, 
integrated most support functions, begun consultations on 
moving our logistics and our repair centres and opened almost 
250 Carphone Warehouse SWAS. We have opened a number 
of co-branded Elgiganten Phone House stores in Sweden and 
launched the Phone House in Norway. In both cases the 
performance of these stores has been very encouraging. 
The Connected World Services management team have put in 
place a newly-configured organisational structure to deliver on 
an already strong pipeline and we now have the sales team to 
develop our pipeline. Post the year end we were very pleased 
to announce a partnership with Sprint in the US, and subject to 
the successful completion of a pilot phase, we will open up to 
500 new stores, as well as a separate agreement to provide 
services to support their existing retail business. In addition, 
following the success of honeyBee in the UK, we are also 
preparing for launch in Canada. 
Our focus on markets where we have scale and relevance led 
to the decision to exit from our retail businesses in Germany 
and the Netherlands, whilst retaining long-term contracts for 
the provision of insurance services in these markets through 
CWS. On 16 July 2015 we also announced plans to dispose  
of our operations in Portugal.  
A great deal has been achieved this year, but there is still  
much to do. Delivery options, IT investment, extending our  
free warranty programme, further training for our colleagues, 
completion of the integration, building on our MVNO and CWS 
businesses, creating a new services business and even 
stronger pricing in some territories are just some of the 
initiatives in our sights to build on our long-term sustainability 
and grow the value of the Company.    Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15

The consumer electronics and mobile phone landscapes  
are in a constant state of flux – and never more so than today. 
This creates challenges of course, but also some exciting 
opportunities. The growth of smartphones, tablets and the 
speed of internet access both in and out of the home, together 
with an increasing number of connected devices, are changing 
the way people live their lives, communicate, and use 
technology. This has made a number of new markets available 
to Dixons Carphone, including wellness, security, content and 
home management. We are focused on building strong 
positions in these markets in the next few years. 
On top of this, the growing complexity and interconnectivity  
of products means that customers are increasingly demanding 
help and support throughout a product’s lifecycle, from 
choosing the right product at the outset through to installation, 
connection, and repair. This provides an increasing opportunity 
for our Geek Squad and KNOWHOW services, as customers 
ask for help in getting their products working – and keeping 
them working.  
Behind our end-to-end service operation we have a 
comprehensive - and unique - infrastructure, including 
technical support, delivery, installation, repair and recycling. 
We plan to leverage this infrastructure to widen our services 
customer base right across our core markets.  
Finally, every team and every individual will have been affected 
by the many changes that the organisation has navigated this 
year. I began by listing some of the many achievements we 
have accomplished in the year, but to do all this whilst ensuring 
we did not take our eye off the ball is a testament to the 
creativity, skill, fortitude and hard work of the very talented 
men and women that make up Dixons Carphone. I would like 
to take this opportunity to offer my humble and heartfelt thanks 
to them.
