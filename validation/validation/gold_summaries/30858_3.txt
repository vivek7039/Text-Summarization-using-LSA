 Chairman’s statement
Return to full statutory profit, doubling of operating margin to 10%,  
Annually Recurring Revenue growing, and strong cash generation.  
Tribal has maintained its market leadership with significant new customers 
gained. Shareholder value is now being created in a sustainable manner.
With the Group placed on a sound financial footing in 2016, and 
with many of its operational challenges addressed, I am pleased 
to report that the Group has now returned to full year statutory 
profit for the first time since 2013.
Annually Recurring Revenues, which now include cloud services, 
grew over 5% to £37 .5m, overall profitability doubled to an 
adjusted operating margin of 10%, compared with 5% in 2016, 
and the Group ended the year with net cash up 59%, at £14.1m 
(2016: £8.8m). Shareholder value is now being created in a 
sustainable manner as the Group continues to drive efficiencies 
in the business: a further £3m of annualised savings was realised 
in 2017 , bringing the total annualised savings realised to £12.0m 
since the initiation of the cost savings programme; this has driven 
improved financial performance without impacting the Group’s 
ability to serve its customers or drive its business forward. 
For the year to 31 December 2017, Tribal Group achieved an 
adjusted Operating Profit of £8.5m, up 82%, on a revenue 
of £84.9m (2016: operating profit of £4.7m on a revenue of 
£90.3m) and increased Adjusted Earnings per Share (diluted) to 
3.2p (2016: 1.9p). The fall in revenue was adversely impacted by 
a combination of the expiry of the Ofsted Early Years contract 
in March 2017 and the disposal of Synergy in March 2016 
– excluding these factors, the revenue increased by 6.5%, 
particularly due to the strong performance in the remaining 
Quality Assurance Solutions (QAS) business.
2017 confirmed that Tribal remains a leading international 
provider of student information systems to universities, 
colleges and schools in the UK, Australia and New Zealand 
markets as well as elsewhere in the world. We serve a large 
installed customer base, including many of the world's leading 
universities and colleges.
During the year, the Group secured significant new contract wins 
in the Higher Education sector, including Sheffield University 
and Glasgow Caledonian University in the UK, and our third win 
in Malaysia, at the University of Malaya. We also finalised a 
AUD$27 .5m (approx. £16.8m), four-year extension to the Callista 
contract, which provides student information systems to  
11 Australian universities for the on-going development of the 
Callista product and seamless migration into the cloud ready  
Tribal Edge platform. 
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 04 I am also pleased to note the strong performance in Further 
Education and Work-based Learning where, in the UK, the growth 
is being driven by significantly improved software sales to new 
business customers, and in APAC, the Campus solution at the 
British Council has been successfully rolled out to 34 countries.
In our i-graduate business there was a change of leadership in the 
first half of the year, and we successfully secured a number of new 
contracts. However, the overall participation by universities in the 
key International Student Barometer survey towards the end of 
2017 was disappointing, as more universities than expected chose 
to skip a year. We look forward to welcoming them back into the 
survey in 2018.
The Quality Assurance Solutions business also performed 
well in 2017 and secured significant contract wins at the Abu 
Dhabi Education Council, the Ministry of Education of Dubai & 
Northern Emirates. In addition to broadening the offerings beyond 
School Inspections to include Performance Benchmarking and 
Professional Development & Training, QAS continues to have 
opportunities to grow and develop its business both in the UK and, 
more widely, to build on our existing contracts in the Middle East 
and the USA. 
Looking to the Future
In 2018, I expect Tribal to continue to secure new clients for 
our Student Information Systems, with a strong pipeline of new 
opportunities in Higher Education, and the prospect of continued 
improvement in sales performance. Additionally, with a further 
contract already secured in Dubai and a strong pipeline of new 
work, QAS enters 2018 with confidence and optimism.
Revenues are expected to be broadly flat in 2018, which 
represents a small growth excluding the impact of the final year  
of Ofsted revenue in 2017 .
I expect the operating margins to increase further, as the cost 
savings achieved in 2016 and 2017 continue to benefit 2018.  
We will continue to look for further efficiencies in 2018. 
We will also continue to reshape our product development and 
customer-facing support businesses to provide a more agile 
and responsive customer-facing environment. As part of this 
change, we are transitioning our current hosted customers 
to a new data centre, in partnership with Rackspace. The 
investment in this migration will provide us with increased 
sales opportunities for hosting solutions to new and existing 
customers, as well as providing a resilient platform for our next 
generation, cloud-based Student Information System.
Although there remains much to do, I see the momentum continuing 
into 2018 and beyond, as the Group continues to drive cost 
efficiencies in the business and increasingly takes advantage of 
the international market for student information systems. 
Employees
I would like to thank all our employees for their hard work and 
commitment. The Group has undergone significant continued 
change through 2017, and that inevitably brings uncertainty. 
The support of the employees has been invaluable in bringing 
the Group through this challenging period. Although there 
is much still to do in 2018, the overall business structural 
changes have largely been made, which should provide a more 
settled and certain environment for 2018. I should also like to 
thank my fellow directors for their hard work, determination 
and persistence in seeking to improve the efficiency of the 
Tribal business.
Dividends
The Board believes that the payment of dividends is important 
and has previously confirmed its intention to pursue a 
progressive dividend policy once the Group’s financial 
performance supported the payment of a dividend. 
Given the good overall performance of the business in 2017 and 
the strong closing cash position, the Group is now in a sustainable 
financial position. The Board has therefore decided to propose a 
dividend of 1p per share. This will be paid in May 2018, pending 
ratification at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Outlook and Current Trading
We expect overall market conditions and demand for student 
management systems to remain stable in 2018. While the timing 
of deal closures and achievement of implementation milestones 
remains difficult to predict, we are well positioned to continue 
to benefit from the demand for student systems and upgrades. 
We have already secured several software and service contract 
wins in the early part of 2018. 
With the introduction of IFRS15 in 2018, there will be some 
impact on revenues and operating profit as the Group will 
be required to spread the recognition of software revenues 
over the duration of the implementation period, rather than 
immediate recognition on installation. This is likely to cause 
a modest transitional dip in revenues and operating profit in 
2018, as large contract wins in year are spread over the future 
implementation period.
Given the factors described above, and the strong platform 
around which to build sustainable shareholder value, I expect 
continued improvement in our profitability during the current year.

Tribal - the perfect fit for 
"Outstanding" Derwen 
College, UK
Derwen College is a vibrant and pioneering college 
committed to promoting the vocational, educational, 
personal and social development of young people 
with a wide range of learning difficulties and 
disabilities, through personalised learning.
Specialist provision comes with unique challenges 
and Derwen College needed a flexible student 
information system that could easily meet their 
exacting requirements. Derwen College chose ebs  
as the perfect fit.
Tribal developed a staff portal specifically for 
Derwen College that allows all members of staff 
to report on all aspects of student behaviour, be it 
praise or concern for a student, instantly through any 
device. ebs collates this information to give a single 
overview of students’ progress. 
"We selected ebs because the system could easily 
be tailored to our needs, allowing our staff to easily 
monitor our students’ progress, and ultimately focus 
their valuable time on our learners’ success” said 
Maggie Furmanek, Director Finance & Resources, 
Derwen College.
