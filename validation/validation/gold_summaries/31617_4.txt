Overview of Group results
Our FY2017 results reflect a year of strong financial performance as we have 
delivered on our strategic priorities in a period of challenging market and 
economic conditions. We have grown our customer lending without compromising 
on asset quality, delivered cost savings well ahead of our targets in the first phase 
of our three year efficiency programme, and taken concrete steps to improve 
our capital position. We are firmly focused on building a solid base for delivering 
sustainable returns to our shareholders.

(1) The summary income statement is presented on a statutory and underlying basis. In addition, the financial key performance indicators 
(KPIs) used by management in monitoring the Group’s performance and reflected throughout this section are determined on a 
combination of bases (including statutory, regulatory and alternative performance measures), as detailed in the Glossary on page 253. 
A reconciliation from the underlying to statutory basis is shown on page 47.
(2)  Impairment losses on credit exposures relate solely to loans and advances to customers (refer to note 3.5 to the financial statements) 
and exclude credit risk adjustments on loans at fair value through profit or loss which are incorporated in the movement in other 
assets and liabilities at fair value within non-interest income (refer to note 2.3 to the financial statements). CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 39

Profits up overall
The Group has successfully delivered on each financial target set out at the Capital Markets Day in 
September 2016 and reported a statutory profit for the first time since 2011 of £182m (2016: loss of 
£164m). Significant progress has been made against the Group’s strategic priorities, which has led to FY2017 
underlying profit before tax increasing to £293m, up £72m (33%). Together with a stable capital base, this has 
been the primary driver of the increase in underlying RoTE, from 5.2% to 7.5% and underlying basic earnings 
per share (EPS) from 16.2p to 21.5p. Our disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet has enabled us 
to increase tangible net asset value (TNAV) from 284.1p to 295.6p per share.
As a result of the progress we have made in improving the performance of our business, we are pleased 
to declare our intention to pay an inaugural dividend to our equity shareholders.
£1.8bn growth in customer lending
The Group’s performance was delivered against a backdrop of challenging economic and market conditions, 
as the effects of the base rate cuts in 2016 and the corresponding fall in LIBOR rates, together with lower 
UK credit growth competitive pricing across the industry, prevailed throughout the year. In spite of these 
pressures, we delivered growth in our mortgage and core SME lending portfolios, up £1.6bn and £0.4bn 
respectively, and saw an increase in our mortgage market share. We remain cautious in the unsecured 
lending market, taking a disciplined approach to pricing in a competitive market; nevertheless, our 
unsecured lending portfolio saw a modest increase in balances year on year.
Growth in the customer lending book has been achieved without compromising asset quality. The 
Group’s cost of risk has remained relatively low at 14bps (2016: 9bps), reflective of the quality and mix  
of our book with the mortgage portfolio accounting for a high proportion of total customer lending  
(2017: 73.4%; 2016: 72.4%).
Active management of customer deposits
Customer deposits increased year on year as we saw 5.3% growth in current account balances, with strong 
recruitment of business current accounts and substantial growth in B savings balances. This growth more 
than offset the managed reduction in volumes of variable rate savings accounts as we rationalised and 
repriced our ISA portfolio. 
This repricing was part of an overall plan to improve our funding mix, with a shift from higher cost deposits 
towards lower cost funding. The Group’s participation in the Government’s TFS was another element of this 
plan, and together these actions helped to drive down the Group’s funding costs, with the blended rate on 
interest-bearing liabilities falling by 25bps to 75bps.
While the rate environment dampened growth in interest income, the actions taken across the liability 
portfolio allowed us to grow net interest income by £38m (4.7%). Overall, these factors combined to drive 
a 1bps increase in NIM to 227bps.

Cost savings well ahead of plan
We continued to improve our operational efficiency during the year through the restructuring and 
streamlining of our business. We incurred restructuring charges of £67m to deliver gross run rate cost 
savings of £90m, we saw the benefits of these actions as the year progressed as our full year underlying 
costs fell by £54m (7%) to £675m, well below our FY2017 guidance of £690m–£700m. As a result, and 
combined with the increase in income, our underlying cost to income ratio improved from 74% to 67%.
Optimisation of our capital base – CET1 ratio 12.4%
Our key capital ratios remain within our required operating range. The core business generated 13bps 
of CET1 capital over the year. Offsetting the growth in our core business were the costs associated with 
restructuring, separation from our former parent and legacy conduct issues which together absorbed 
61bps of CET1.
The capital position benefited from the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme (the Scheme) to 
future accrual for the majority of employees, improving the IAS 19 position by £88m and contributing to an 
IAS 19 surplus of £207m at the year end. In addition, the trustees completed the 2016 triennial valuation, 
which resulted in a reduction in the Scheme deficit (on a trustee funding basis) from £450m to £290m and 
no change to the existing deficit repayment schedule agreed with the Trustee in June 2014.
In April 2017 we submitted our application to the PRA for permission to use the IRB approach to calculating 
credit RWA. This marked a key milestone in our path to IRB accreditation. 
Outlook for 2018
The lending market will, we expect, remain competitive, especially for home loans. However, our pipeline in 
both our mortgage and SME businesses is strong and supports our plans to deliver continued asset growth. 
It is likely that we will see further price pressure in the mortgage and unsecured personal loan markets. 
Our strong deposit-gathering capability, founded on our personal and business current account franchise, 
will ensure that we fund our growth in a sustainable and cost-effective manner. We expect to see modest 
pressure on net interest margin and our NIM guidance for FY2018 is 220bps.
Our efficiency programme will capitalise on the momentum seen over the past 12 months, and will focus 
on procurement and organisational design enhancements in the coming year. With a track record of 
achieving sustainable cost savings, we are confident in our ability to deliver savings in line with our guidance 
and further reduce our cost income ratio.
We will manage our capital base within our stated operating range for CET1 of 12 to 13%.
