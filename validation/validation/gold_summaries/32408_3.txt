CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Financial results
Group revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by  
7 per cent. to £22.5m (2016: £21.0m) whereas Net Fee Income (“NFI”) 
improved on the prior year by 8 per cent to £6.19m (2016: £5.73m). The 
results over the past year have seen lower than expected performance 
at a Group level. The investment in staff training and development and 
the introduction of a new CRM system will enhance the results going 
forward but had a direct effect on the Group results to March 2017.
Whilst organic growth in the short to medium term will serve the 
business well for the business to meet our long-term objectives, the 
Board also continues to focus on identifying suitable businesses to 
join the Group to enhance profitability, add new service lines and 
geographies.
Strategy
Nakama Group’s strategy has continued to concentrate on providing 
staffing solutions with two highly specialised businesses: Nakama 
within the digital, creative, media, marketing and technology sectors 
and the UK business within the financial services sector. The approach 
focuses on delivering a local, regional and global solution. The business 
continues to maintain this as fundamental but will look to broaden 
the service offerings across the Group with an emphasis on providing 
digital solutions to clients across recruitment, outsourcing, on site and 
consultancy through the use of technology. It is the strategy of the 
Board and management team to be a leading international specialist 
within staffing, delivering a quality service to our customers and 
candidates whilst creating a sustainable business for the long-term 
benefit of all stakeholders.
The management team has stabilized over the past year and is now 
in a position to focus on delivering value to clients and shareholders 
going forward. We continue to look to recruit further excellent, driven 
individuals to meet our client and candidate needs.
There are currently no new offices planned for the next financial year as 
the Board intends to concentrate on improving the performance of the 
current operations.
Executives and staff
The Group retains a strong team of very knowledgeable and long 
serving staff and we look forward to continuing to build the Nakama 
Group. The Board would like to acknowledge the loyalty and 
commitment of all the staff to the Group and we are extremely grateful 
for their efforts. Again we extend a very warm welcome to all new 
members of the team.
Outlook
Trading in the first quarter has been in line with expectations. Whilst 
the market sectors in which Nakama operates are in high demand, the 
business needs stable local economies in the current trading locations, 
stability in current staff numbers and the continued hiring of new sales 
staff to deliver against less specialised but much larger competitors. 
The Board looks to 2018 as a year in which the Group will seek to grow 
organically and review other options to grow in terms of net fee income 
and profit.
