STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
Chief 
Executive’s 
Statement
  It is pleasing to report another year of good progress and strong results, 
against a backdrop of economic uncertainty.  
   
Growing earnings
Continued demand for space in our popular and busy 
locations, together with our proven management strategy, 
has resulted in an increase in net property income of 5.0% 
to £88.3 million. We are now reaping the benefits of the 
important refinancing initiatives we completed in October last 
year , which significantly reduced our finance costs. T ogether , 
these factors have contributed to an increase in EPRA 
earnings
1
 of £6.2 million to £45.2 million, which equates to 
an increase in EPRA earnings per share1 of 15.7%. 
Uplift in NAV
Our exceptional portfolio has delivered underlying capital 
value growth of 7.0% over the year, adding 83 pence (9.3%) 
to EPRA net asset value per share
1
. The increase in value 
reflects the combined impact of growing current income 
and the prospect of sustained future income growth, 
particularly in locations which are expected to benefit from 
Crossrail-related footfall in the coming years. Limited 
opportunities to buy the type of buildings we own, and 
continuing strong investor demand, have led to a reduction 
in investment yields in the West End market, particularly in 
the second half of the year.
This valuation uplift has been offset partly by the cost of 
terminating our remaining legacy interest rate swaps, which 
amounted to 20 pence per share. At 30 September 2017, 
EPRA NAV per share
1
 stood at £9.52, an increase of 64 
pence, or 7.2%.

STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S STATEMENT  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017
A unique portfolio in an 
exceptional location
Our portfolio extends to some 600 buildings across 14½ acres of London’ s 
West End. 
Our investment strategy is focussed on restaurants, leisure and retail, uses 
which, in the West End, have a long record of resilience and growth. Our 
long-term management strategy of assembling clusters of ownerships 
enables us to curate and promote distinctive destinations which offer a wide 
variety of innovative, mid-market choices in dining, leisure and retail.
London is the largest city in Western Europe and most visited city in the 
western world, with an estimated 19.1 million international visitors in 2016. 
Current forecasts point to a growth in tourist numbers of around 3.5% per 
annum through to 2025. 
Located at its heart is the West End, with its exceptional variety of visitor 
attractions, from cultural and historic to dining and shopping. The exceptional 
numbers of domestic and international visitors, together with a large local 
working population, mean that the West End is busy seven-days-a-week, 
throughout the year. It offers a prosperous trading environment for our 
occupiers, attracting demand for space and sustaining growth in our rental 
values and income.
Within the West End, the availability of space, particularly for restaurant, 
leisure and retail uses, is constrained by local planning and other policies. 
This structural imbalance between demand for, and availability of, space is 
fundamental to our portfolio’ s rental and capital value prospects.
The West End economy
In our long experience, the breadth of the West End’ s economy provides 
considerable protection from the cyclicality and headwinds experienced by 
the UK national economy.  
Over the year, business and consumer confidence has begun to come under 
pressure, and growth in the national economy is slowing. However , conditions 
in the West End have so far largely been unaffected. In particular, weakness 
in sterling has provided a boost to the spending power of international visitors 
as well as increasing visitor numbers. Our restaurants, cafés, bars and shops 
are reporting resilient trading growth, better enabling them to absorb 
upward pressures on operating costs currently faced by all businesses.
Demand for the smaller accommodation that traditionally we offer is 
healthy. Lettings, lease renewals and rent reviews are being concluded on 
terms in line with our expectations, and vacancy levels have remained in line 
with our long-term trend of 3%, or less, of portfolio ERV.
We are making good progress at our three larger schemes. 46% by ERV of 
the completed space is now either let or under offer and marketing of the 
remaining space continues. This larger space we are offering requires 
occupiers to invest significant sums in fit-out and take on substantial rental 
commitments and we expect letting periods to be longer than for smaller 
space. Macro-economic uncertainties are now showing signs of slowing 
potential occupiers’ decision–making processes. We shall be patient in 
selecting occupiers which match our long-term aspirations. 
The widely reported increase in national business rates took effect in April 
2017. As we anticipated, average increases for our occupiers were in the 
range of 30% to 40%, with a large number of our smaller tenants able to 
benefit from a four-year transition period. Occupiers of large space on 
streets where rental levels are above our average have seen greater 
increases, and only limited transition provisions. Despite these unwelcome 
increases in operating costs for our tenants, we have not seen any direct 
impact on occupancy levels or interest in leasing space.
During the year, we concluded £31.1 million of leasing transactions, achieving 
rents for commercial space 6.7% above ERV at the previous year end. This is 
not only converting an element of our reversionary potential in to 
contracted income, but it also provides valuable evidence to increase rental 
tones and grow income from our adjacent and nearby buildings.
West End connectivity and 
infrastructure
The completion of Crossrail 1 is now a year away, with the first services on 
the Elizabeth line expected in December 2018. Once fully operational, this 
important addition to London’ s transport network will add 10% to its 
capacity, and materially improve accessibility to the West End. Over the 
medium term, we expect the new transport hubs at Tottenham Court Road 
and Bond Street will result in significant changes to traditional footfall 
patterns throughout the West End. With all our portfolio in close proximity 
to these hubs, we anticipate being a major beneficiary of these changes, 
with a number of our streets expected to see much increased footfall and 
profile, enhancing their long-term rental growth prospects.
Continuing investment across the transport network is improving reliability 
and increasing capacity, encouraging travel by public transport to the West 
End. Last year’ s introduction of 24-hour running at weekends on certain 
underground lines has been well-received, and initial passenger numbers 
have exceeded forecasts.
Elsewhere, we are seeing a number of Crossrail-related public realm 
schemes progressing. Of great importance to the West End is the initiative 
announced, earlier this year, to pedestrianise much of Oxford Street. This 
will bring significant benefits, including a much-improved pedestrian 
environment and a reduction in traffic-generated air pollution. Currently, it 
is expected that the first stage of pedestrianisation, west of Oxford Circus, 
will be operational by mid-2018. Planning for the eastern end of Oxford 
Street is underway. 
Investing in our portfolio
Our strategy is to adapt our buildings to meet the expectations of today’ s 
occupiers, and improve energy performance, through reconfiguration and 
refurbishment, rather than redevelopment. We focus on uses where we 
provide space in shell form only, with tenants taking responsibility for what 
are often substantial fit-out costs. This significantly reduces our exposure to 
obsolescence costs across the portfolio. Consequently, despite continuing 
high levels of activity across our holdings, capital expenditure remains 
modest. This year, our outlay was £40.3 million, slightly above our long-term 
average of around 1% of portfolio value. Additionally, our share of capital 
expenditure in the Longmartin joint venture was £1.2 million.
We continue to identify schemes across our portfolio, and are prepared to 
intervene to negotiate early vacant possession of space to accelerate our 
plans. We balance the costs of these initiatives against the valuable 
long-term benefits to income and capital values, which frequently 
compound across our extensive adjacent ownerships.
Adding to our portfolio
We have assembled our portfolio over a period of 31 years, through acquiring 
single buildings, small portfolios, or occasionally large blocks, which were in 
single ownership. We apply strict investment criteria to every purchase, and 
focus on the prospects for long-term income growth potential through 
harnessing our forensic market knowledge, our particular skills in improving 
older building stock and capturing synergies with our other ownerships.
The buildings we seek to acquire in our chosen locations are frequently in 
long-term private ownership. Their availability is always limited, as existing 
owners are reluctant to sell in our sought-after areas. Understandably, 
competition to purchase is intense, as other investors appreciate the 
long-term prospects and security they offer.
This year, additions to our portfolio totalled £37.1 million. In addition, in 
August 2017, we announced the forward purchase of a strategically important 
block on Berwick Street in Soho, for £38.5 million. Currently, it is undergoing 
a major redevelopment, which is expected to finish in late 2018, at which 
point we will complete the acquisition. 9

Refinancing legacy debt and hedging
T aking advantage of low long-term interest rates, over the year, we have 
taken important steps to refinance the remainder of our legacy debt and 
hedging, whilst adding to our financial resources.
We have issued £575 million of long-dated bonds, comprising £285 million 
for 15 years at 2.487% and £290 million for 10 years at 2.348%. The 
proceeds were used, in part, to fund the early repayment of our historical 
debenture stock and a bank facility. In addition, we have terminated our 
remaining £180 million of interest rate swaps.
Together, these transactions reduced the cost of our debt significantly, 
benefiting earnings and dividends, as well as adding around £310 million to 
our financial resources. In a competitive investment market, the ready 
availability of funding to secure acquisitions gives us a valuable advantage.
Long-term rewards of a long-term 
strategy
October 2017 marked the 30th anniversary of the listing of Shaftesbury’ s 
shares on the London Stock Exchange. In our early years, whilst we owned a 
block of 26 restaurants in the centre of Chinatown, our assets comprised 
mainly offices in London and several UK locations. From mid-1993, we 
refocussed the business, concentrating on restaurant, leisure and retail in 
London’ s West End.
Our long-term approach to assembling and managing this exceptional portfolio 
has delivered sustainable growth in income, which is the ultimate driver of 
long-term value. The success of this strategy is evident in our performance. 
Since we floated in 1987, our share price has risen 460%, compared with the 
FTSE 350 Real Estate Index of 94%, and since our focus switched to the 
West End, the increase has been 1,431% against 119% for the sector.
Looking ahead
The uncertainties created by last year’ s EU referendum decision have 
increased during 2017. It may be some time before the UK’ s future trading 
and other arrangements with the EU become clear , and there could be further 
challenges as their ramifications become apparent. Inevitably, business and 
consumer confidence is being affected, slowing economic growth and 
business investment.
The broad economic base of the West End, and its enduring global appeal to 
visitors and businesses, underpin its resilience and long-term prospects, providing 
a considerable degree of protection against national economic headwinds. 
This has been evident in the strength of our performance through different 
business cycles and operating environments in our 31-year history.
The successful implementation of our distinctive strategy is due to our 
committed, experienced and enthusiastic team, supported by the wide range 
of external advisors who are invaluable in delivering our strategy . T ogether , they 
bring flair and innovation to the management of our portfolio, ensuring it 
evolves and adapts to meet the ever-changing tastes and expectations of all 
those who visit, work or establish businesses in the West End.
Underwritten by the unique features of the West End, we are confident our 
strategy will continue our long record of growing our exceptional portfolio’ s 
income and value, and, in turn, the returns we deliver to our shareholders.
