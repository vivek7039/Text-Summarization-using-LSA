 10 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Chief Executive’s Statement
Operational performance
Gleeson Homes continued to grow volume and margins and 
grew operating profits by 16.9% to £22.8m. Gleeson Homes 
increased its land pipeline by 24.8% to the equivalent of 
11.4 years sales at current build rates and active outlets 
increased by 23% to 59 sites. Whilst we have a growing 
pipeline, we always apply for planning permission at the 
earliest possible date and start building as soon as we 
receive it.
Gleeson Strategic Land increased land sales to 8 sites 
leading to operating profits growing by 17.6% to £12.0m. 
The result of the Group’s disciplined approach to investment 
was a £10.8m increase in our cash balances to £34.1m and a 
220 basis points increase in return on capital employed  
to 25.4%.
  
Gleeson Homes
Demand for Gleeson Homes remained strong with net 
reservations taken during the second half of the financial 
year increasing by 45% compared to the same prior year 
period. Mortgages remain highly affordable and available 
to our customers. Two thirds of our customers use the 
Government’s Help-to-Buy scheme; the highest priced home 
that used the scheme, at £183,445 is significantly below the 
current Help-to-Buy limit of £600,000. The average priced 
house purchased with Help-to-Buy was £122,210. 
There has been a great deal of media comment about 
the difficulties young people face purchasing a home, but 
typical Gleeson Homes buyers are blue collar workers aged 
between 18 and 33. This year we sold 60 houses to people 
aged 21 or under. The Real Living Wage (of which we are 
great supporters) has helped the working class young

to qualify for a mortgage and their ability to earn paid 
overtime enables them to save a deposit.
Our chosen segment of the market is large, mostly untapped 
and not really affected by the vagaries of politics or the 
general economy. This is because the outgoings relating to 
the purchase of one of our homes are significantly less than 
renting a council or housing association house. If a young 
blue collar couple want to reduce their outgoings they 
should buy a Gleeson home. 
We recently announced our intention to double unit sales 
from our original medium term target of 1,000 units p.a. 
to 2,000 units p.a., within 5 years and expect to either 
maintain or grow margins. To achieve this, we are:
• Growing the pipeline of owned and conditionally 
purchased sites by acquiring land in existing and new 
areas; we now have 141 sites in the pipeline.
• Investing in new office locations; we now have 7 area 
offices in the North and North Midlands and 2 new pilot 
offices in Cumbria and East Yorkshire.
• Developing our management team across all levels 
including Build Managers and Site Managers.
• Developing our employee and key sub-contractor process 
for finding and retaining key people.
• Continuing our unrelenting focus on cost reduction in 
order to offset material and employment cost pressures.
• Continuing to listen to our customers to ensure we 
provide what they need to buy a Gleeson Home.
This is why we are confident that we can double the size 
of the Gleeson Homes business within five years. We intend 
expanding in an orderly manner and will put the right 
people in the right places to deliver that expansion. MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 11

Our business model is founded on a close engagement 
with our customers and their communities, productive 
cooperation with local landowners, empowerment of our 
people and fair treatment of our supply chain to ensure that 
we are building a best in class product.
Our model is unique and is driving growth which mutually 
benefits our customers, our communities, and our 
shareholders.
I have never understood the need to sell properties 
leasehold and our only two leasehold sites are part of an 
arrangement stipulated by Burnley Council. The ground rent 
is low and we have reduced it even further to a peppercorn.
We make it our priority to make the house buying process 
fully transparent to our customers:
• We charge a fee of £200 for covering our costs for vetting 
architects’ drawings and giving permissions for extensions 
and conservatories but we do not charge for minor 
permissions.
• Householders on certain sites pay third parties to 
maintain open space areas. These charges are generally 
around £100 per year per house and are challengeable by 
residents.
• There are no other “hidden” costs or charges.
We ask our Mortgage Consultants to stay in contact with our 
customers for at least two years after purchase in order to 
help them manage their new financial environment. A two 
year fixed interest-mortgage can often be re-negotiated to 
our customer’s advantage and we certainly don’t want them 
to take out any pay-day loans.
We are accredited to and great supporters of the Living 
Wage Foundation which has helped many of our customers 
become homeowners.
We pay our suppliers and sub-contractors promptly and 
we reward good quality and service by paying our A* 
subcontractors within a week.
Gleeson Homes prides itself in being active in the 
communities in which it operates. We have sponsored  
79 junior sports teams in the last 5 years and we are 
currently sponsoring 25.
We have regular community challenge makeovers where 
local community facilities are refurbished to give local

charities and sports facilities better homes. We will be doing 
three this year which, with contributions from suppliers 
and subcontractors, will between them have a cost of 
around £100,000. We are proud to make a real difference 
and members of our staff roll up their sleeves and help at 
weekends. 
We have registered YourWatch® as a trade name and we  
are now able to license it to other organisations. This is  
a social media platform substitute for Neighbourhood Watch 
which works extremely well in some of the more socially 
challenging areas in which we build; it contributes to a 
reduction in crime and gives our customers a sense  
of security.
My team are dedicated to all of the above and to developing 
the financial performance of the business unit. 
Our forward order book has never been stronger and we are 
looking forward to another successful year.
Our unique model will continue to create thriving 
communities and to drive our business forward to our  
2,000 units p.a. target.

Strategic Land
Significant investment over the last few years has led to  
a growth in operating profit of 17.6% to £12.0m from  
8 transactions completed in the year. 
Although most major house builders have strong land banks 
there is always a healthy demand for good land from either 
major players or mid-range house builders looking for 
replacement sites.
We do not take the risk of purchasing land outright, 
preferring to take out options or similar agreements. This 
low risk and low cost approach has enabled us to invest 
heavily in the promotion of sites through the planning 
process and build up a strong portfolio.
Our highly skilled business unit based in Fleet in Hampshire 
is growing its team in order to support our recent 
investment which will result in even greater consistency in 
the flow of transactions.
Current trading & outlook
We have plenty of land on which to build homes, people to 
build them and a strong management team that can grow 
the business in a profitable and disciplined way. Demand 
and affordability of Gleeson Homes continues to be strong. 
The Gleeson Strategic Land portfolio is in good shape and 
demand remains strong from other housebuilders. The 
uplift in dividend signals our confidence in continued cash 
generative growth. We look forward to delivering our new 
target of doubling Gleeson Homes volumes to 2,000 p.a. 
within 5 years. 
We are confident the current financial year will be another 
excellent year for the Group.

THE GLEESON APPRENTICESHIP SCHEME
Since 2010 the Gleeson Apprenticeship Scheme has trained over 80 young 
people and we have a record 32 apprentices starting in September this year. 
The scheme provides invaluable site experience in the bricklaying and joinery 
trades, whilst allowing them to study for an NVQ at a local college. Find out 
more on page 20.
LIVING WAGE FOUNDATION
The only house-builder accredited to the Real Living Wage Foundation paying all 
employees and sub-contractors the Living Wage, or higher. The only exception 
to this is for apprentices, where we pay above the Government’s guidance for 
apprentices. Find out more on page 68.
YOURWATCH®
Our trademarked YourWatch® scheme provides our residents with the 
anonymity to report their concerns without repercussion via the YourWatch® 
website. We then share this information and, where necessary, send warnings 
through instant alerts straight to residents’ inboxes. Find out more on page 23.
THE GLEESON COMMUNITY SPORTS FOUNDATION
Since the inception of the Foundation five years ago we have sponsored 79 
junior sports teams, providing brand new kit and funding for teams in and 
around our development locations. Find out more on page 22. 
THE GLEESON COMMUNITY CHALLENGE
Following the success of our inaugural Community Challenge in 2015 we launched 
the competition again in 2017, inviting charities and non-profit organisations to 
apply for a makeover of their facilities. This year , three successful organisations 
benefited from a makeover, with Gleeson volunteers and subcontractors kindly 
donating their time and services. Find out more on page 24.
EDUCATION, EDUCATION, EDUCATION
As part of our Community Matters programme we work with local schools near 
our developments, many of which are in challenging areas, on varied projects. 
These include competitions with primary age children asked to design their ‘dream
bedroom’ for re-creation in the showhomes and, this year, we have expanded 
the programme into secondary schools. Find out more on pages 19 and 23.
GLEESON’S BLOOMIN GREAT GARDEN COMPETITION
Every summer our homeowners can win cash prizes by sending us pictures of 
their front garden. The competition encourages residents to spend a little time 
and money on their garden which in turn keeps our neighbourhoods attractive 
places for all to live in.
