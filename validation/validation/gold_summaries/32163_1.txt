17 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
This year, more than ever before, 
we have seen increasing 
evidence to give us confidence 
in our strategy and business 
model. The commercial real 
estate market is swinging on an 
axis and the pendulum of 
demand is moving firmly 
towards highly designed and 
super connected space let on 
flexible terms. 
Business owners all over London 
are looking at their space 
requirements and considering a 
range of new factors when 
assessing their occupational 
requirements. They are taking 
into account employee 
commutes, availability of 
meeting and breakout space 
outside the four walls of their 
office, proximity to excellent 
coffee, gyms and safe cycling 
routes, as well as the quality of 
the technology infrastructure 
and the neighbourhood 
community which can provide so 
many additional benefits to their 
business.
This trend is positive for us as it 
means that almost any business 
could be a Workspace customer 
and we are marketing to a much 
wider audience as a result. With 
our space attracting freelancers, 
start-ups, established businesses 
and larger, more traditional 
organisations, the opportunities 
for us to grow our business are 
significant. 
Workspace is a property 
company; however, we are also 
an online retailer of space and a 
technology provider with 
customer service at the centre of 
what we do. As we bring new 
and upgraded space to the 
market, it is clear that while the 
quality of the real estate is 
critical, the facilities that we are 
able to offer our customers are 
just as important. 
Recognising that Workspace has 
a true advantage, in May 2017 we 
launched the Workspace 
Advantage marketing campaign. 
This involved a wide-reaching 
presence across digital and 
social platforms, as well as 
creative visuals placed in tube 
carriages and stations all over 
London to target commuters on 
their way to and from work.
The “advantage” that Workspace 
customers have access to is 
three-fold: business-grade 
connectivity with no constraints, 
personalisation of space, lease 
terms and facilities, and a 
community that fosters business 
growth. And all of that is set 
within the inspiring spaces 
created in our business centres. 
As we directly manage our 
relationships with our customers, 
we can be confident that our 
offer meets the criteria they 
value in searching for a home for 
their business. However, with 
businesses constantly evolving, 
these criteria are not static and it 
is crucial that we continue to 
innovate and upgrade our 
systems and practices to ensure 
we are always enhancing our 
offer.
Our results this year give a clear 
indication of how we’ve been 
able to capture these 
opportunities. We’ve seen 
consistently strong demand for 
our space, with high levels of 
enquiries despite the uncertainty 
that followed the outcome of the 
EU Referendum. Our rental 
growth has outperformed the 
market, with like-for-like rent roll 
up 13.7% in the year and rent per 
sq. ft. up 12.9%. A tight control 
over costs means that the 
growth achieved in rental 
income falls straight to the 
bottom line and, as a result, 
trading profit increased 15.5% to 
£50.7m in the year.
It’s been another active year for 
the Workspace team, with a 
number of new buildings coming 
on stream, all of which have 
performed ahead of 
expectations. We have also been 
successful in achieving several 
planning consents during the 
year, while continuing to manage 
some exciting refurbishment 
projects that will be launching 
soon. We have continued to 
seize opportunities to expand 
and, more recently, we acquired 
a prime office building in the 
heart of Fitzrovia.
Looking forward, there’s a huge 
amount more to come. We have 
a strong pipeline of 
refurbishment and 
redevelopment projects, which 
will deliver more than one million 
sq. ft. of new and upgraded 
space over the next three years, 
and we continue to have great 
confidence in our ability to 
expand and grow our business. 
We celebrate our 30th 
anniversary this year and we are 
proud to have supported many 
businesses in achieving their 
success over that time. The 
insight and deep market 
knowledge that comes from our 
long history in London, alongside 
an inherent culture of innovation, 
has created a powerful 
combination that positions us 
well for future growth.

Chief Executive’s strategic review
continued 
The right 
strategy  
drives future 
performance.
This strategy has been in 
place for over five years now. 
Its relevance and different 
component parts are discussed 
and debated regularly at Board 
and Executive Committee 
meetings and we continue 
to believe that it is the right 
strategy for the business. 
In fact, as outlined by our 
Chief Executive on page 17, 
we believe that the wider real 
estate market is moving ever 
closer towards our strategy 
with companies adapting in order 
to meet the increasing demand 
for flexibility, well-designed 
office space with all the right 
amenities and a secure, reliable 
technology offer.
Right market
We continue to believe that 
London is the right market 
for our business. As explained 
on page 5, the opportunity 
in London is extremely attractive 
with growing demand from all 
types of businesses for our 
offer. In addition, our deep 
knowledge of the real estate 
market in London means 
we have been successful in 
acquiring new properties that 
meet the demand for space 
and will deliver attractive 
returns to shareholders.
Right properties
One of the principal growth drivers 
of our business is the letting 
up of new and upgraded space 
delivered by our refurbishment 
and redevelopment pipeline. We 
remain focused on creating and, 
opportunistically, acquiring the 
right properties that will attract 
our customers. 
Right customers
When we defined our current 
strategy, we defined our 
customer market as New and 
Growing Companies. Over the 
years, this has evolved and 
we now find that our offer is 
relevant to all businesses, from 
freelancers and early stage 
businesses right up to well 
known brands and established 
companies from all industries.
Right people
Employing the right people 
continues to be critical for 
the success of the business. 
Workspace’s operational nature 
means our teams are managing 
a huge amount of activity every 
day and are tirelessly focused on 
servicing our customers. See 
some of the unique roles held by 
our employees in the resources 
and relationships section on 
pages 28 and 29.
Right brand
Workspace has a strong brand 
and we work hard to ensure 
that our offer is highly visible 
to prospective customers as 
they embark on their search for 
office space. Digital marketing, 
a strong social media presence 
and employees who live the 
brand values are all key to 
attracting and retaining 
customers and ensuring high 
levels of customer satisfaction.
Case studies on the following 
pages demonstrate the strategy 
in action over the last year and 
outline how our strategy will 
continue to deliver results in 
the future.

Strategy in action:
Let up ahead of expectations, 
more in the pipeline
The new Grand Union Studios 
on Ladbroke Grove opened 
to customers in March 2016. 
By December 2016, it was 80% 
let, at pricing significantly above 
expectations, demonstrating 
the strong demand we continue 
to see from customers for 
our space.
The success of this project gives 
us the confidence to proceed 
with our extensive pipeline 
of refurbishments and similar 
redevelopments. During the 
year, we received planning 
consent at four sites, including 
for refurbishments at Pall Mall 
Deposit, also in Ladbroke Grove, 
and Mare Street Studios in Hackney. The

Strategy in action:
The Leather Market
One of our most iconic business 
centres, acquired in the early 
1990s, The Leather Market is 
a listed building in London 
Bridge. It is currently under 
refurbishment to bring the 
services and design up to 
the high standards that our 
customers require today. 
The project, which completes 
in August 2017, includes the 
creation of a newly designed 
entrance, high quality café and 
connected meeting rooms.
 
The recycling of capital receipts 
from disposals to fund our 
ongoing refurbishment 
programme is a key part of 
our strategy and helps to drive 
income and capital value growth. The

Taking advantage of market 
opportunities
From a tired office building 
that had reached its maximum 
pricing potential, in a hugely 
popular area just moments from 
Farringdon’s Crossrail station, 
Workspace has launched its 
newest business centre on to 
the market. 
We have already seen good 
demand for The Record Hall in 
Hatton Garden, which will boast 
89 units, roof terraces, Club 
Workspace, high-spec meeting 
rooms, workshops for jewellery 
traders and the trial of a new 
café partnership for Workspace.

Filling the pipeline
In April 2017, we acquired 
13-17 Fitzroy Street, a fantastic 
building in a very attractive 
central London location. 
Let to engineering firm Arup 
until 2020, the building will then 
enter our refurbishment pipeline 
with plans to reposition it as a 
multi-let business centre for 
our customers.
