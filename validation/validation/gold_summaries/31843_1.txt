 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 
STRATEGIC REVIEW
As evidenced by the tough UK market environment experienced 
in the first half of the year, some of these changes continue 
to provide challenges to our business, but they also provide 
significant opportunities. Our ‘GAME Changing’ strategy is focused 
on realising these opportunities and, while our overall financial 
results for the year were disappointing, I am pleased with the 
strategic progress we have made over the last 12 months.
Across our retail businesses we have continued to enhance 
and differentiate our specialist proposition, including launching 
our new ‘GAME Elite’ membership scheme in the UK. We 
have further developed new categories and ranges, such 
as digital content, PC gaming and licensed merchandise, 
delivering strong sales growth in these areas. We have made 
improvements to our multichannel proposition, to make 
shopping with us even more convenient and we continue to 
take steps to reduce costs and optimise the performance of our 
retail footprint. The immense flexibility of our lease portfolio 
continues to support significant reductions in fixed costs whilst 
also allowing us to reposition our retail and venue approach in 
major cities and towns.
Importantly, we have made significant progress in pioneering 
and delivering competitive gaming at a local level. Our ‘BELONG’ 
gaming arena initiative was launched just over a year ago, with 
an encouraging performance being delivered from the first 
18 venues in operation. At the same time, we have successfully 
developed our digital enterprise businesses. We will continue 
to expand our BELONG footprint in the UK and we are planning 
to launch our first arenas in Spain in 2018.
The fast-moving dynamics of our industry demand that we 
be agile and focused with regards to the Group’s strategic 
direction. Accordingly, following a recent review of the 
Group’s business areas, and particularly in light of the positive 
performance of BELONG, we have decided to prioritise the 
development of our experience based esports and competitive 
gaming proposition. Consequently, the Board has evaluated 
strategic options to maximise shareholder returns from our 
digital enterprise activities.
Despite GTV growth in the second half period of 6.6%, overall 
Group sales for the year (measured as GTV) fell by 2.4% to 
£891.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA was £8.0 million (2016: 
£25.6 million). Strong working capital management helped 
us to end the year with an increase in our cash position (net of 
overdrafts) to £47.2 million (2016: £43.1 million). Together with 
access to financing facilities across the Group of c.£77 million 
as at year end, this means that we have the required cash and 
facilities to develop our plans and drive future growth over the 
next 12 months.

Our industry continues to evolve rapidly, 
with huge growth in esports, live 
streaming, social and mobile gaming, 
whilst social media is changing the 
way games are played and how gaming 
communities interact. Innovative new 
games consoles and technologies are 
coming to market, including virtual 
reality devices and, most recently, 
the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Xbox 
One X, and at the same time consumers 
are continuing to benefit from an 
ever-increasing choice in how they buy 
and play games. Console price points 
have reduced further encouraging 
more customers to buy into current 
generation consoles with PlayStation 4 
seeing stronger relative performance.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Beyond retail
Discover, browse, 
buy, play and compete, 
all under one roof
Growing the number of locations that 
house a BELONG gaming arena with 
GAME is central to our strategy
By creating venues where gamers can 
discover, browse, buy, play and compete 
in their favourite games, we are providing 
gamers with access to everything they 
need as well as spaces to create unique 
and engaging gaming experiences.
Our average customer spends around 
£165 a year with us, whilst a customer 
who also visits BELONG will spend over 
£239. This increased customer loyalty 
has seen those stores with a BELONG 
arena deliver sales 9% ahead of the UK 
average, despite the reduction in retail 
selling space. 
We opened a further 17 in-store gaming 
arenas during the year, taking our total to 
18, and also launched the BELONG brand, 
under which the gaming arenas trade.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OUR MARKETPLACE
Introduction
GAME Digital operates in the global 
interactive entertainment and video 
games industry. 
The foundation of the Group’s business is its position as the 
leading retailer of video games in the UK and Spain, where 
the majority of the Group’s sales originate. These markets, 
comprising mint and preowned hardware, software and 
accessories, and digital content are core to the business.
More recently, a focus on the diversification of the Group’s 
operations through business development and acquisition has 
facilitated our entry into new markets, encompassing both new 
retail categories (for example the retailing of PC gaming and 
virtual reality products) and new gaming verticals, including 
esports and competitive gaming activities and major consumer 
gaming events. 
Below we discuss five significant long-term trends impacting 
our marketplace.

Major market trend 1:
An industry in growth
The audience and value of the video games industry is expected 
to continue to grow.
 — Video gaming is a large, dynamic and growing industry.
 — The global audience for gaming is expanding as games 
become ubiquitous across all platforms and devices, 
with billions of players globally.
 –  In 2016, there were estimated to be over 31m players 
in the UK (source: NewZoo), approximately half the total 
population. Of those that play games, 59% of them spend 
money on games.
 –  Approximately one third of UK players play mobile, console 
and PC games.
 — The total interactive entertainment (video games) market was 
estimated to be worth $113 billion in 2016 (IDG), making it the 
second largest entertainment platform behind TV.
 — The industry is forecast to grow to over $150 billion by 2021 
(IDG), a CAGR of over 7%. 
 –  Within this, the global console gaming market is forecast 
to grow to $30 billion by 2021, up from $21 billion in 2016.
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — The immense size and continued growth of the video games 
market presents opportunities for all industry players, 
including GAME Digital, providing a huge and growing 
audience with which to engage.
 — The long-term positive industry dynamic is attracting 
investment and innovation across the industry – across 
all formats – console, PC and mobile gaming, as well as in 
newer areas such as virtual and mixed reality and esports, 
as discussed in more detail below.
 — Our core focus is to take action to maintain and increase 
share in our core console markets and to drive growth from 
emerging market opportunities.

Major market trend 2:
Enduring popularity of console gaming, 
characterised by market cycles
Console gaming remains an enduringly popular, but cyclical 
gaming segment, driven by periodic platform innovation and 
the release of new games titles.
 — Despite the significant growth of smartphones and mobile 
gaming over the last decade, console gaming remains 
consistently popular, particularly in Western markets.
 – Having launched in November 2013, the number of PS4 
and Xbox One consoles now sold in the UK (the ‘installed 
base’) stands at 7.3 million as at September 2017, 13.6% 
ahead of the installed base at the same point in the 
previous cycle (GfK Chart-Track).
 – Furthermore, Nintendo’s latest console, ‘Nintendo Switch’, 
was released in March 2017, and set new records around 
the world for a Nintendo console launch. 
 - Since the popularity of the Wii console receded from 
2009, Nintendo has comprised a smaller share of the 
market in Western territories, however this decline 
is expected to reverse following the launch of the 
Nintendo Switch, which has brought renewed growth 
to console markets globally in 2017.
 — Console markets tend to exhibit cyclical characteristics, 
with total hardware and content sales typically peaking two 
to three years after the initial launch.
 – To extend the console lifecycle, reduce cyclicality and 
compete with the shorter upgrade cycles of PC and mobile 
hardware, more frequent and meaningful innovations are 
being introduced into the marketplace: 
 - Recent mid-cycle upgrades (e.g. PS4 Pro in 2016, Xbox 
One X in 2017) represent significantly more powerful 
consoles than the standard model, offering enhanced 
graphics fidelity and gameplay.
 - Innovative new accessories offer engaging new gaming 
experiences, such as Virtual Reality gameplay (e.g. PS VR).
 — Console market performance is also influenced by the 
strength of new games released in any given year. 
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — GAME Digital continues to derive the majority of its sales 
from console gaming markets (mint and preowned hardware, 
software and accessories and mint digital content), with 
dynamics in this market having a significant impact on the 
Group’s performance.
 — Whilst the continued popularity of console gaming is positive, 
the late-stage of the current PlayStation and Xbox console 
cycle (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) resulted in a market 
contraction in the first half of the financial year in the UK, 
providing a challenging market backdrop. This contraction 
was compounded by a weaker line-up of new game releases 
in the period compared with the prior year.
 — Looking forward, we are well placed to benefit from the 
recent launch of the Nintendo Switch, which has helped the 
UK market return to growth, as well as Microsoft’s Xbox One 
X console, launched earlier in November 2017.
 — Console gaming will remain core to our business for the 
foreseeable future, and therefore maintaining and increasing 
our share in these markets remains a key priority for the 
Group. We are also focused on the Group’s expansion into 
new retail categories and gaming markets, which, over time, 
will allow us to reduce exposure to the inherent cyclicality 
within the console retail market.

Major market trend 3:
Growing consumer appetite  
for digital content
 — The consumption of digital content, comprising full game 
downloads, expansion packs, in-game ‘micro-transactions’ 
and digital subscriptions to console gaming platforms (e.g. 
PlayStation Network and Xbox Live), has seen strong growth 
in recent years, driven by increasing broadband penetration 
and the greater availability and promotion of in-game 
content, with publishers focused on driving greater player 
engagement across fewer, larger games titles.
 — This trend has seen the overall console content market 
(physical and digital) grow, however it has also impacted 
on the growth in the value of physical game purchases 
being made across the market.
 — IDG forecast that from 2016-2021 global sales of console 
digital content will increase 80%, from $10.4 billion to 
$18.6 billion, whilst over the same period physical sales 
will increase 1.3%, from $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion.
 — Sales of digital games and additional content take place 
directly through the ‘digital dashboard’ and also at retail. 
Retailers are able to participate in the digital marketplace, 
selling digital games, additional content, currency and 
subscriptions via Electronic Software Delivery (ESD) through 
our proprietary Codebank system and Point of Sale Activation 
(POSA) cards both in stores and online. 
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — The transition from physical to digital products and channels 
will continue to impact our markets and this is something we 
are focused on addressing.
 — Our priority is to take action to maximise our share of both 
the physical and digital content markets, while adding new 
products and services to our customer proposition and 
striving to improve efficiencies to lower operating costs.
 — Retailers have established themselves as an important 
channel for the sale of digital products and GAME is the 
market leader in this channel for digital console products, 
with a c.60% share of retail sales in both the UK and Spain.
 — An increasing range of digital content, novel ways to pay for 
products such as trade-in and GAME Wallet, and our focus 
on educating and assisting customers with their digital 
purchases ensures we are well placed to maintain and grow 
our position within the growing digital content market.

Major market trend 4:
The awareness and popularity of esports 
continues to grow rapidly
 — The esports market, defined as competitive video gaming, 
continues to experience rapid growth in viewership, 
participation and interest.
 — In 2016, industry analysts estimate that over 320 million 
people watched or participated in esports globally. This 
figure is expected to reach almost 600 million by 2020 
(source: NewZoo), driven by material investment into the 
industry and the continued growth of internet-connected 
gaming devices.
 — Like mainstream sports, the esports value chain is multi-
layered with participants comprising games developers and 
publishers, amateur and professional players, teams, clubs 
and associations, tournament and league organisers, local 
venue operators and event organisers, broadcast platform 
owners and studio content creators, viewers, fans and other 
consumers and brands. 
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — The continued growth in the popularity of esports is a 
strongly positive trend for GAME. Our nationwide footprint 
and brands ensure we are well positioned to lead the 
development of mass-participation amateur esports in the 
UK and Spain – which we are pioneering through BELONG 
gaming arenas, Insomnia and our UK Masters series of 
esports tournaments. 
 — From a retail perspective, the growth in the esports and 
competitive gaming market is expected to drive increased 
demand within the high-end peripherals markets across 
both PC and console gaming categories. In addition, the 
market for licensed merchandise related to esports teams, 
tournaments and games is also expected to grow.
 — We are focused on developing community gameplay, 
supporting grassroots players, organising major gaming 
events and expanding our PC gaming ranges to tap into the 
growing interest and participation in all forms of esports and 
competitive gaming.

Major market trend 5:
The online channel is becoming an 
increasingly popular option for consumers
 — A key structural change in the UK retail market has been the 
shift away from physical stores to online, particularly mobile, 
driven both by shoppers’ increasing appetite for convenience 
and digital connectivity, and service enhancements in 
online operations.
 – In 2017 it is estimated that 40% of the UK video games 
market will be transacted online, up from 27% in 2012.
 – The online channel in Spain is less well developed, 
accounting for 15% of the market. Similarly, from a lower 
base, this is also expected to grow.
 — As the online channel expands, driven by more competitive 
propositions, technology and services, consumers are 
encouraged to shift more of their spend online, accelerating 
the pace of the channel shift further.
What this means for GAME Digital?
 — Our position as a ‘bricks and clicks’ retailer affords us 
the ability to provide consumers with greater flexibility 
and convenience than online pure-plays, with our stores 
remaining a vital point of customer contact, education 
and engagement. 
 — Indeed, customers that shop in more than one channel 
are twice as valuable as single-channel customers and 
as online grows in importance as a channel we are focused 
on developing an integrated consumer proposition and 
multichannel strategy that delivers a consistent brand and 
customer experience regardless of touch point or channel.
 — Today, we retain a larger share of the physical ‘bricks and 
mortar’ channel than the online channel, however we 
continue to invest in the online channel and develop our 
range, offer and services and as the segment expands 
we have the opportunity to capture market share through 
improving both the online and omnichannel customer 
journeys and proposition.
 — GAME is uniquely placed to use all of our key differentiators 
around Reward, Elite, Trade-in and our specialist credentials 
through exclusive products and deals to deliver a unique 
multichannel experience.
 — As consumer habits develop we have adapted our in-store 
proposition to include experiential gaming concepts and 
introduced other developments to differentiate the retail 
proposition from online competitors.
 — Similarly, we continue to optimise our store portfolio through 
finding new, larger, more productive stores in major markets, 
to smaller, lower cost stores and concessions in other markets.
