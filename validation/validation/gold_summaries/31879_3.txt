based on consensus earnings
This has been another excellent year for the Group across all key operational and 
financial performance metrics. We achieved record profits, completion volumes were 
at their highest level for nine years and we remain industry leading in terms of quality 
and customer service. 
We have delivered our FY17 financial targets of 20% gross margin and 25% ROCE, 
and we are committed to further progress. Improving our profit margin remains a 
priority for the Group and we have a number of initiatives underway to further increase 
efficiency, reduce costs and simplify our business. 
We remain the largest housebuilder in the UK, delivering 17,395 homes in the year 
reflecting the strength of our housebuilding operations.
Our sites were awarded 74 NHBC Pride in the Job Awards for site management 
this year, more than any other housebuilder for the 13th year in a row. We were also 
awarded the Home Builders Federation maximum five star rating for the eighth 
consecutive year – the only major housebuilder with this record. We have now won 56 
Built for Life accreditations for excellence in the design of homes and neighbourhoods, 
more than all the other housebuilders combined.
These are significant achievements and are testament to our continuing focus on 
leading the future of housebuilding by putting customers first and at the heart of 
everything we do.
Political and economic environment
Whilst the General Election in June 2017 
created some uncertainty, Government 
support for housebuilding and a commitment 
to tackle the country’s housing shortage 
remain. The Government’s Housing White 
Paper published in February contained many 
positive measures, particularly those aimed 
at speeding up the planning system and 
bringing forward more land for new homes. 
Following the outcome of the EU referendum, 
the Board continues to monitor carefully the 
potential impacts of the vote to leave the EU 
on our business. 
Market conditions remain good with a wide 
availability of attractive mortgage finance, 
which, alongside Help to Buy, continues 
to support robust consumer demand. 
The Group is in a strong position, with a 
substantial year end net cash balance, healthy 
forward sales position and an experienced 
management team.
Consequently, we remain confident in the 
strong fundamentals of the housing sector 
and our business.
Our employees
The outstanding progress made during the 
year would not have been possible without 
the capability and dedication of our Senior 
Management team and employees whom 
I would like to thank on behalf of the Board. 
We ensure that we reward all of our employees 
appropriately so that we can recruit and retain 
the best people whilst motivating them to 
continue to perform year on year.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 – Barratt Developments PLC     9

Corporate Governance
Underpinning any successful Company, is good 
corporate governance. Corporate governance 
is the basis of good management practice 
and we place it at the heart of everything we 
do. It is embedded in our policies, procedures 
and processes throughout our business from 
Board level to our divisional operations. 
Last year the Government published a 
Green Paper on Corporate Governance. 
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
announced a fundamental review of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code to take into 
account their work done around corporate 
culture and succession planning. The review 
will also take account of the issues raised in 
the Government’s Green Paper and the BEIS 
Select Committee inquiry.
We have begun to explore the various 
proposals in the Green Paper and the FRC 
review with our advisors. We have already 
taken steps to establish a forum at which 
employee representatives from across 
the business will have the opportunity to 
express the views of the workforce on key 
topics such as culture, diversity, training 
and remuneration. This will ensure that best 
practice is embedded in our business and that 
we can effectively respond to, and implement, 
any changes that may be required as new 
regulation or legislation is introduced.
We will continue to ensure that good corporate 
governance remains embedded within the 
culture and values of the business as a whole 
whilst adapting our policies, processes and 
procedures in light of any changes proposed 
by the Government and the FRC. Through the 
Nomination Committee, we will ensure 
that we continue to have robust succession 
planning in place for both Board members and 
Senior Management.
On 22 June 2017, we were pleased to announce 
the appointment of Jessica White as Chief 
Financial Officer. Jessica was previously 
Group Financial Controller and is therefore 
very familiar with the way in which the Group 
operates. Jessica’s full biography and details 
of the recruitment process followed are set 
out on pages 46 and 62 respectively. 
More information on the composition of 
the Board and the individual roles and 
responsibilities of each Board member is set 
out on pages 46 and 47. 
Delivering returns for our shareholders
In line with the improved Capital Return Plan 
announced in February 2017, and given the 
strong financial performance of the Group, the 
Board is pleased to propose a final dividend 
of 17.1 pence per share (2016: 12.3 pence 
per share) and a special dividend of £175.0m 
(17.3 pence per share), both of which, subject 
to shareholder approval, will be paid in 
November 2017. The total proposed dividend 
for FY17, including the interim dividend of 7.3 
pence per share paid in May 2017, is therefore 
41.7 pence per share (2016: 30.7 pence 
per share).
We continue to cooperate fully with the 
Metropolitan Police on the ongoing 
investigation we instigated regarding possible 
misconduct in the London business. As stated 
in October 2016, Barratt does not anticipate 
any material adverse financial effect and our 
London business is operating well.
Appointments and succession
A number of Board changes took place during 
the year. 
After eight years of service, Mark Rolfe stood 
down from the Board after the 2016 AGM. 
Jock Lennox, who had joined the Board on 
1 July 2016, took over as Audit Committee 
Chairman. Details of the work undertaken 
by the Audit Committee during FY17 can be 
found on pages 65 to 73. In addition, Richard 
Akers was appointed as Senior Independent 
Director with effect from the conclusion of 
the 2016 AGM.
As announced on 19 January 2017, Neil 
Cooper, previously Chief Financial Officer, 
left the Board by mutual agreement. 
Information regarding the payments made to 
Neil on leaving the business can be found on 
page 103 and throughout the Remuneration 
Report. From that date, David Thomas 
performed the dual roles of Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer. In order to maintain 
a stable governance framework, the Board 
ensured that David had sufficient support from 
members of the Senior Management team 
and from members of the Board to enable him 
to undertake his day to day duties under both 
roles. Details of the steps taken can be found 
on page 62. 
Conclusion
I believe that you have a strong and 
experienced Board dedicated to managing 
your Company efficiently with a great focus 
on achieving long term sustainable value. 
The Board continues to have the right 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge 
to deliver the strategy of the Group during 
FY18. We remain, as ever, cognisant of the 
need for continued assessment of the Board 
and will keep under review the effectiveness, 
time commitment and tenure of each of 
our Directors.
I, on behalf of the Board, would like to thank 
you for your continued support and look 
forward to seeing many of you at our AGM 
on 15 November 2017.
