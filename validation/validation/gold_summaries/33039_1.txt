KEEPING BT AHEAD OF THE GAME
BT is barely recognisable as the company it was ﬁve years ago.
Five years ago, we were primarily a UK lines and calls
business; today we are offering communications possibilities
that no one had even thought of back then to customers in
170 countries.
Possibilities that really do enable them to lead fuller lives and
run more proﬁtable, innovative businesses.
In a very short time, we’ve gone from a narrowband,
ﬁxed-line communications business, to a broadband company
harnessing the power of modern networks to help our customers
communicate anywhere, any time, using whatever devices they
happen to choose.
We’ve brought levels of choice and control to our customers
at home, at work, or out and about, that would once have
seemed impossible.
................................................................................................................................................
Helping some of the
world’s largest companies
and organisations serve
their customers around
the world
................................................................................................................................................
Who would have thought ﬁve years ago that BT would be
offering next-generation digital TV over broadband? Our BT
Vision service enables customers to watch what they want when
they want – without having to pay a monthly subscription.
Who would have thought that our customers would have
been beneﬁting from intelligent, seamless ﬁxed/mobile
communications – like BT Fusion – at home, at work or in
between – chatting, swapping data, surﬁng the internet, doing
business?
Who would have thought that we would be helping some of
the world’s largest companies and organisations do business and
serve their customers around the world? Who would have
thought that geography would be history and time irrelevant?
But the thing about transformation, however radical and
however successful, is that there is no end point. No moment
at which you can sit back and think ‘job done’.
Even when we hit ﬁve million broadband connections in 2005
– more than a year ahead of schedule – there was no time to
take it easy. Today, that number is around 11 million and
climbing.
Our broadband success sums up the type of company BT
is becoming. A company that goes the extra mile, that rallies
behind its goals, that ﬁnds ways of meeting its customers’
needs – locally, nationally, internationally and globally.
FROM OUR TIME TO YOUR TIME
Nothing is more important than offering a great customer
experience ﬁrst time, every time. It differentiates BT from the
competition; it is what the BT brand stands for.
Excellent customer service can only be delivered in ‘customer
time’ – the time that customers want. Quite rightly, customers
have no interest in, or patience with, ‘our time’ – the time it
takes our systems to make it happen.
Meeting customers’ needs in customer time is vital to proving
that we understand them, share their priorities and enthusiasms,
and really do put them ﬁrst.
This type of ‘real-time’ customer experience is best delivered
by software. In the future, BT’s services will increasingly be
based on software – designed, delivered and updated remotely
by computers over broadband networks. These services will be
faster, more innovative, reliable and simpler to use – often
delivered by the push of a button.
These software-driven, networked IT services will be delivered
over our global twenty-ﬁrst century broadband network.
We have set ourselves the target of becoming number one for
customer service within two years. To ensure that we continue
to think and act in customer time, two measures will apply
throughout the company and keep everyone focused. First, we
will measure how successfully we get things ‘right ﬁrst time’.
Second, we will measure the improvements we make in the
‘cycle time’ – the time between the start and end of any
customer experience.
Overview
Chief Executive’s statement
BT has been capturing the imaginations of customers,
shareholders, analysts, suppliers and employees around the
world. We’ve done this by embracing change. By demonstrating
not only that we can thrive on it, but that we can help our
customers thrive on it as well. We’ve done it by proving that
when it comes to modern communications, the possibilities really
are endless. And we’ve done it by being a company that is driven
by its customers, shifting power and choice to them.

BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 7
OPEN ORGANISATION, OPEN MINDS
It is vital that BT is an ‘open business’ with an open mind.
We are open to new ideas and new ways of doing things.
We are working with suppliers, industry partners and others with
a single, compelling objective – to get the best possible services
to our customers around the world as quickly as possible.
Customers don’t care about whether any given service was
designed by W, manufactured by X, delivered by Y and billed
for by Z. They care about what it can do for them – whether it
makes life easier or a business more proﬁtable.
CITIZENS OF A GLOBAL VILLAGE
All our customers – private individuals, families and large
corporations – are increasingly thinking and behaving like global
citizens. They want the world on their PC, laptop, or hand held
device. And they want to be able to organise themselves and do
business, build markets and win customers as and where it suits
them.
................................................................................................................................................
A truly global software-
driven services company
................................................................................................................................................
And meeting their global needs means ensuring that we really
do understand them, that we really can get inside their heads.
For consumer customers, global communication means being
able to keep in touch and access information whether they are
in York or New York, Mumbai or Rome.
For modern organisations, global communication means the
opportunity to take advantage of the best resources and talents
wherever they are located.
We aim to become a truly global software-driven services
company, with a great global brand, helping our customers get
the best from globalisation.
It’s a fantastic opportunity and one that BT is seizing with
both hands.
In recent years, we’ve acquired a reputation for winning and
delivering complex, large-scale networked IT services contracts.
Our extensive global network enables us to serve customers
in all the world’s key commercial centres – either directly or
through partnership arrangements.
Major contracts in the 2007 ﬁnancial year included a deal
with Dutch electronics giant, Philips, to provide data, voice,
conferencing and mobile services in Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, and a deal with PepsiCo to manage a portfolio of
advanced services covering more than 900 locations in over
60 countries.
Our services are helping organisations meet the needs of their
own customers wherever they may be.
THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE RIGHT JOB
Strategies and plans cannot, of themselves, deliver the kind of
transformation that BT is experiencing and that we are going to
have to accelerate in the future. Only people can do that.
That’s why it’s so important that our workforce is just as
much a global community as our customers.
Our customers are a cross section of society – they encompass
a huge range of nationalities, as well as social, cultural, political
and personal orientations. In order to reﬂect that diversity, we
are recruiting the brightest and the best from around the world.
BT people have already shown what they are capable of; and
there’s a lot more where that came from.
The job of every person who works for BT is what it always
was: to ensure that everything they do every day is done for all
our customers around the world. Only now, they have to do it
quicker than ever before, in more innovative ways than ever
before and more seamlessly than ever before.
I have no doubt whatever that they will do just that.
