 Maintaining our momentum
In my past five years as Chief Executive 
Officer we have achieved some major 
milestones. We listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, have achieved 2.6 million 
live customer policies and employ over 
3,100 colleagues. We are now valued at 
£2bn and RMI has made significant 
long-term investment in our company. 
In a challenging marketplace, we maintain 
momentum and continue to deliver 
profitable growth.
“ We are committed to doing 
the right thing for all of our 
4Cs and I am proud to be 
part of the Hastings family. 
In my new role as Chairman 
from May 2018, that will 
continue.”

Tell us more about how you will 
achieve your new targets? 
A
We set ourselves four targets at the time 
of the IPO and we refreshed these in 
March 2017. Our targets include a growth 
target: to have 3 million customers 
during 2019; a risk target: to deliver a 
calendar year loss ratio within the range 
of 75 - 79%; and two cash and capital 
targets: to reduce our net debt leverage 
multiple to 1.0x during 2019, and to 
continue paying a healthy dividend with 
a payout ratio of between 50% and 60%.
We’ve continued to make good progress 
in executing our growth strategy, with 
a 13% increase in policy numbers 
throughout 2017, and are very confident 
of meeting our target of 3 million 
customers during 2019.
The majority of our planned growth 
will come from our core motor book, 
with continued momentum from an 
increasing share of price comparison 
websites (PCW) sales, a profitable 
maturing book and the launch of a 
new multicar proposition in 2018 which 
will be enabled by the implementation 
of Guidewire. 
We are continuing to see more 
customers using PCW to buy their 
insurance and we have been able to 
apply our successful approach in motor 
to the home insurance market. We now 
have over 2.6 million customers and we 
started underwriting home insurance 
ourselves as a lead insurer in small 
volumes earlier this year.
Q
It’s been a year since RMI 
acquired 29.9% of the Company. 
How has the relationship 
evolved? 
A
The transaction with RMI concluded 
on 1 March 2017, and represents a 
real statement of intent and long term 
confidence in Hastings. Since then, 
Herman Bosman, the Chief Executive 
Officer of RMI has joined our Board and 
attended many board meetings and 
provided additional insights. 
When we announced RMI as our 
new major shareholder, we said that 
we might explore potential areas of 
co-operation with them and their 
subsidiary, OUTsurance, given their 
experience in the general insurance 
market and if it was the right thing to do 
for our 4Cs ways of working. To support 
our colleagues and customers in early 
2018, we started working in partnership 
with OUTsurance to take calls primarily 
over evenings and weekends. This is in 
addition to the large scale recruitment 
across our UK sites, which will allow 
us to improve shift patterns for our 
Hastings colleagues, making them more 
flexible and reducing the number of 
evenings and weekends they are asked 
to work. As you would expect when  
we shared this news internally it was  
well received.
Q
How has Hastings invested in 
colleagues to support future 
growth plans?
A
Our continued success is a testament 
to the work of our colleagues and we 
are very lucky to have some of the 
best people in the industry working 
for us. Our agile, data driven business 
model and strong reputation have 
attracted some very experienced 
colleagues this year into senior roles 
that will help us deliver ambitious 
growth plans. We continue to attract 
a growing number of full time and 
part time colleagues who deliver great 
customer and claims service at our head 
office site in Bexhill and second site in 
Leicester which is now home to over 
1,200 colleagues. We have introduced 
a new homeworking model for some of 
our frontline colleagues and plan to use 
OUTsurance more this year to support 
our colleagues and customers, primarily 
over evenings and weekends. 
We remain committed to developing the 
skills and careers of all of our colleagues 
and to provide them with the right tools 
to do their jobs. In 2017, we launched 
our new internal career portal that 
provides information about internal 
career frameworks and guidance on the 
training and development colleagues 
need to help develop their careers with 
Hastings. We also made significant 
investment in Guidewire our new 
system that will help both colleagues 
and customers.

Q
There’s been significant 
investment in Guidewire; can 
you tell us more about it and 
its implementation?
A
Guidewire is a market leading software 
that supports claims, broking and billing 
in an integrated platform. We have 
also invested in additional software 
components to increase the ability of 
our customers to self-serve through 
digital engagement. Improvements 
for our customers and our colleagues 
include reducing the claims lifecycle, 
more informed pricing, and enhancing 
our customer services by providing a 
24/7 online self-service portal.
We have realised significant benefits 
following the launch of the claims 
module, and continue to improve and 
enhance the system based on colleague 
feedback and customer experience. 
We are following a staged roll out of 
the broker platform and all major PCW 
were live on Guidewire for private 
car insurance by the end of 2017. In 
addition, we have commenced migrating 
our private car insurance renewals 
business to Guidewire. It will enable 
efficiencies that will deliver value and 
provide a platform for future growth.
Q
What is your outlook on premium 
rate increases? 
A
We began increasing premiums in the 
first half of 2014, ahead of the market 
that started raising rates in 2015, after 
a three year period of sustained price 
reductions. Premiums continued to rise 
across the market driven by continuing 
claims inflation, with additional increases 
seen following the change to the Ogden 
rate announced in February 2017, 
which increased both claims costs and 
the cost for excess of loss reinsurance. 
In the last quarter of 2017, we started 
seeing pricing fluctuations following 
the UK Government’s subsequent 
announcement regarding further 
proposed changes to the Ogden 
rate calculation. 
As you look into the future, we would 
expect premium rate changes to 
follow claims inflation, with some 
uncertainty surrounding the proposed 
changes to the Ogden rate, and also 
from the planned whiplash reforms. 
As ever, we continue to focus on the 
quality of our underwriting, and the 
agility of our pricing model means we 
can react quickly to claims, market 
or regulatory changes.
Q
What’s your view on the impact 
of autonomous cars on the 
insurance industry? 
A
We welcome any environment that 
improves road safety; however we do 
view broad adoption of fully automated 
vehicles as being many years away. 
Manufacturers will continue to introduce 
partial automation that will improve 
the safety of vehicles and in turn help 
to reduce the frequency of accidents. 
We have found that the improvements 
in technology have made it more 
expensive to repair vehicle damage, 
which is offsetting the benefits from 
lower frequency of accidents. We expect 
these trends to continue in the future 
and we use our data and analytical skills 
to build these changes into our prudent 
underwriting approach.

16 | Chief Executive Officer’s Q&A Q
Can you tell us about corporate 
responsibility at Hastings?
A
It’s important for me and my colleagues 
to see firsthand the difference we 
can make through our charitable and 
community interactions so we focus  
our attention locally rather than 
supporting national or global initiatives. 
This approach is embraced by our 
colleagues through their fundraising 
efforts and participation in  
community days.
As an example, in July, our leadership 
team took the opportunity to join forces 
to give back to the local community and 
say thank you for the past 20 years. 
The teams took part in beach cleaning, 
student career advice and providing 
afternoon tea and bingo for older people, 
and also ran charity shops with items 
donated by colleagues. It was great to 
give practical help as well as raise money 
for our local charity partners.
I am very proud of the work we do with 
local students in Bexhill and Leicester 
through our ‘Be the Change’ programme 
which aims to raise the aspirations of 
local 13 and 14 year olds by providing 
workshops, one to one sessions and 
workplace visits. It is particularly 
humbling and gratifying when students 
speak openly and honestly about their 
actions or feelings as a result of our 
business mentors sharing their own 
experiences with them. I know that my 
fellow business mentors are equally 
as proud of Be the Change and the 
difference we can make to the younger 
members of our local communities.
Q
What has been your personal 
highlight of 2017?
A
We’ve achieved a number of milestones 
including celebrating our 20th anniversary 
with our colleagues and communities. 
In the time that I have been here, live 
customer policies (LCP) have more than 
doubled – from 1.1 million in 2012 to over 
2.6 million today – and our colleague 
numbers have increased to over 3,100. 
Another key highlight is RMI’s investment 
of 29.9% in Hastings. This shows a 
real statement of intent and long term 
confidence in what we are, what we are 
doing and what we are going to do. 
I am honoured to be part of the 
Hastings 20 year history and the team 
that has achieved so much in creating 
a successful, fast growing UK general 
insurance provider.
 
Q
Looking forward, why the change 
from Chief Executive Officer to 
Chairman? 
A
With Mike Fairey’s decision to retire as 
Chairman at the AGM in May 2018 and 
the Board’s unanimous support, it felt 
as if it was the right thing to do. It allows 
me to remain part of the Hastings family 
and to draw on my experience of chairing 
boards and committees, notably as Vice-
Chairman of Barclays PLC, Chairman of 
UK Banking and Barclaycard at Barclays, 
and in my current role as Non-Executive 
Chairman of VISA Europe. 
Mike has achieved a huge amount for 
us over the past three years, including 
guiding us through the IPO and our early 
years as a listed entity, and I wish him all 
the best on his retirement.
 
Q
What do you think Toby van der 
Meer will bring to the role of Chief 
Executive Officer? 
A
Toby has an extensive background in 
direct financial services and I am delighted 
that we were able to promote internally 
after an industry wide search. 
Before joining Hastings, Toby was a 
Managing Director at MoneySupermarket, 
one of the UK’s leading PCW, where 
he was responsible for the money and 
broker led businesses and operations. 
Before that he spent nearly a decade in 
senior financial services roles including 
leading Citigroup UK’s retail bank and 
as a member of the executive team of 
online bank Egg. Toby joined us in 2011 
as Managing Director for Retail and in 
this role has been responsible for the 
development of the Company’s UK Retail 
business, which covers around two 
thirds of our Group profits. Toby also has 
considerable digital and customer service 
experience, and is currently responsible 
for product and retail pricing, brand 
and marketing, digital, and customer 
operations at our Bexhill and Leicester 
sites. In his seven years with us, Toby has 
played a pivotal role in the significant 
growth and development of the Group’s 
Retail business and he is a well respected 
leader within the Group. These credentials 
and his commitment to our 4Cs ways of 
working, make Toby a natural successor to 
take Hastings forward to the next stage of 
its journey. I wish Toby every success in his 
new role.
