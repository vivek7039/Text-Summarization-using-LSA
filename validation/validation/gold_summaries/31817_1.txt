ENHANCING 
OUR EXPERTISE
CHIEF EXE CUTIVE OFFICER’ S S TATEMENT
We have made substantial changes in our approach to the 
business which underpin our confidence in future success.
Summary
 •
We have developed a substantial pipeline 
of commercial opportunities in Display and 
in June secured the important milestone 
of our first commercial sales orders.
 •
New production methods have achieved a 
substantial reduction in costs while increasing 
the productivity of installed capacity.
Overview
While the Group has not met the commercial 
targets we set ourselves a year ago, we have made 
substantial changes in our approach to the business 
which underpin our confidence in future success. 
We have implemented an enhanced go-to-market 
strategy, invested in manufacturing capability and 
received our first commercial sales orders, all against a 
backdrop of growing global interest in our technology. 
The evolution in marketing strategy for the display 
industry, initiated in 2016, has enabled the Group to 
accelerate the roll-out of its technology. We have 
moved from an exclusive licensing model with Dow 
to a hybrid model, combining multiple non-exclusive 
licenses with direct sales of own manufactured product. 
In August 2016, we announced that we had signed 
up Merck as a second licensee of our technology.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR GROWING DIRECT 
SALES PIPELINE
NDA, scope and design specifications
Specification agreement  
and development sampling
Technical approval
Design win
First commercial sales orders
Engineering samples
Contract negotiation 
and commercial sales
As a result of promotion activities (e.g. conferences) and 
outreach, customer enquiries are screened and prioritised 
before entering into a mutual non-disclosure agreement 
(“NDA”) – this is the start of our sales pipeline. Following 
detailed technical discussions to establish the customer 
specification and Nanoco film solution options, an iterative 
program of work is undertaken. This involves computer 
simulation modelling and multiple film samples to best fit the 
customer’s display system. When technical approval is 
achieved, the customer’s “product team” presents the new 
device in demonstrator form to their business management or 
customers. If they decide to proceed to market, and launch 
the product, we are awarded a “Design Win”. What follows is 
the “kick-off” of a qualification process involving validation 
steps and engineering samples of increasing quantity, 
building to mass production and contracted supply – this 
whole process has no defined timescale, can be very lengthy 
and is not within our control.
We also developed our own channel to market for 
product manufactured at our facility in Runcorn, UK, 
and sold via our Taiwanese partner Wah Hong (referred 
to as “our direct partner”). We now have a three-pronged 
go-to-market strategy which will enable us to capitalise 
on the expected demand for our CFQDs. During the 
year, in conjunction with Wah Hong, we have developed 
a substantial pipeline of commercial opportunities in 
Display and in June secured the important milestone 
of our first commercial sales orders. We remain very 
excited about the potential for our technology both 
in Display and in our emerging Life sciences and 
Specialised lighting developments.
Display market
The market in display for CFQDs continues to grow, 
driven by the increasing appetite for enhanced 
colour and brightness and the penetration of 
ultra-high-definition (“UHD”) TVs. IHS Technology 
(“IHS”) forecasts 26 million displays will be quantum 
dot (“QD”) equipped by 2021, with more than 90% of 
the market cadmium free. Samsung, with its QLED 
brand, is leading the field and sold more than 3 million 
QD displays in 2016. Other than Samsung, the market 
for quantum dot displays is still in its infancy although 
the introduction of UHD TV and media-centric 
monitor products will drive growth in the markets.
While other display OEMs are embracing CFQD 
technology, adoption continues to be slow due 
somewhat to protracted regulatory initiatives to restrict 
the use of cadmium. However, in early August 2017, 
the European Commission announced legislation, 
which passed into law in October 2017, banning the 
use of cadmium in displays from 31 October 2019, 
which we expect to accelerate the shift to CFQDs. 
Several major Taiwanese and Chinese display and 
TV manufacturers are now actively seeking CFQD 
solutions, where Nanoco continues to have a 
competitive lead.
Commercialisation
Nanoco’s CFQDs are now being manufactured 
at Nanoco’s Runcorn facility and at Dow’s large 
manufacturing plant in Cheonan, South Korea, while 
Merck is also evaluating the establishment of a 
manufacturing facility. These sites will manufacture 
CFQDs, blend them into a resin system and supply 
the combined CFQD resin system to multiple display 
integrators located across Asia. Samsung is the 
market leader in CFQD display at present and 
Nanoco and our licensees are all actively marketing 
Nanoco technology to the global display industry 
to compete effectively with Samsung. 
Commercialisation – Runcorn
Nanoco’s Runcorn manufacturing facility has been 
extensively enhanced to meet anticipated demand. 
New production methods have achieved a substantial 
reduction in costs while increasing the productivity 
of installed capacity. Runcorn now has the capacity 
to produce enough CFQDs to supply approximately 
1 million large TVs per annum. Further capacity can 
be achieved with limited capital expenditure and 
will be brought online as demand increases. 
STRATEGIC REPORT 08
Strategic report
Commercialisation continued
Commercialisation – Runcorn continued
We were pleased to announce in December 2016 
that the Company had been awarded ISO 9001:2015 
certification for our production and supply processes, 
underlining the robust nature of our systems.
Commercialisation – Wah Hong
Wah Hong, which is quoted on the Taipei Exchange, 
is our partner for the production and sale of our Fine 
Color Film
TM
. We chose to partner with Wah Hong as 
it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of 
optical films and sheets for the display industry 
and has a large operational footprint across China, 
Taiwan and Southeast Asia. We have benefited 
from its industry and supply chain knowledge and 
customer contacts since signing the agreement in 
July last year. Under the agreement, Nanoco will 
supply resins containing CFQDs from our manufacturing 
facility in Runcorn and Wah Hong will incorporate 
the resin into a film, under Nanoco’s CFQD
®
 Fine 
Color Film
TM
 brand, and sell to the display industry. 
We will generate revenue from the sale of resin to 
Wah Hong and receive a licence fee from Wah Hong 
based on its sales and two further milestone payments 
dependent on the volume of film sold.
The Group’s relationship with Wah Hong has 
progressed well over the period. Product from Nanoco/
Wah Hong was used by three manufacturers, Hisense, 
TCL and TPV Philips, at CES in January 2017, to 
demonstrate prototype large screen, UHD, wide colour 
gamut LCD TVs. Feedback and lead generation from 
CES were encouraging and further validated the 
market opportunity. As a result, Wah Hong brought 
forward its investment in a new coating line which is 
now commissioned and capable of producing films to 
fit up to 100-inch TVs. These developments resulted in 
Wah Hong placing the first commercial orders for 
CFQDs from Nanoco in June 2017. 
In September 2017, Nanoco’s technology was 
featured at Touch Taiwan 2017, a leading show 
for the world’s display industry, where major global 
television manufacturers showcased state-of-the-art 
4K and 8K UHD products incorporating Nanoco’s 
CFQD
®
 Fine Color Film
TM
.
At the Display Innovation Conference, which ran 
alongside Touch Taiwan 2017, Nanoco’s Senior 
Vice President of Global Sales gave a presentation 
on the growing demand from manufacturers and 
consumers for quantum dots as a method of 
achieving wider colour gamut and enhanced picture 
quality in the next generation of displays.
The trade show further validated the growing interest 
in state-of-the-art TVs and monitors incorporating 
CFQDs to enhance colour performance. 
Over the last year we have developed a very active 
pipeline of sales opportunities (see sales pipeline on 
page 7). The Group’s key short-term focus is on TV and 
monitor projects with near term potential. Moving projects 
through the sales pipeline into commercial sales takes 
many months of intensive work. Each customer has its 
own requirements and it is difficult to predict how long 
customers’ processes will take to reach mass production 
status. Nanoco/Wah Hong will continue to develop 
further opportunities in the future.
Commercialisation – Dow
Nanoco signed an exclusive licence agreement 
with Dow in January 2013 for Dow to manufacture, 
market and sell Nanoco’s heavy-metal-free quantum 
dots into the display market. Last year Dow and 
Nanoco agreed to amend the licensing agreement 
from exclusive to non-exclusive. Dow sells product 
under the TREVISTA
TM
 brand, manufactured in its 
facility in South Korea. We generate royalty revenue 
from Dow calculated as a percentage of Dow’s 
sales of Nanoco CFQDs.
Dow continues to see growing interest in CFQDs 
and is making good progress with several Display 
customers considering movement to quantum 
dot technology.
Commercialisation – Merck
Merck is the leading German science and 
technology company focused on healthcare, life 
sciences and performance materials, and the 
manufacturer of approximately 60% of the world’s 
liquid crystals used in liquid crystal displays. Nanoco 
will generate revenue from sales made by Merck 
from licence fees and royalties on Merck 
manufactured sales. 
Nanoco has completed the transfer of its 
technology to Merck, which has successfully 
produced pilot plant scale quantities of CFQDs at 
its facility in Darmstadt, Germany. Merck is carefully 
watching the development of the CFQD market and 
will continue to purchase CFQD products from 
Nanoco until it decides to build its own manufacturing 
facility. Merck is actively engaged with its potential 
customers on various CFQD application projects 
and sells under the Livilux
®
 brand.
Commercialisation – staying ahead 
of the technology curve
In May 2017 Nanoco signed a collaboration and 
joint development agreement (“ JDA”) with Kyulux Inc. 
Under the agreement, Nanoco’s CFQDs will be 
combined with Kyulux’s technology to create future 
generation hybrid OLED/QLED display technology 
with superior qualities to existing products in the 
display market. 
Nanoco also strengthened its intellectual property 
in electroluminescence with the acquisition of a patent 
portfolio from Kodak Eastman. The Group now benefits 
from c. 600 patents and patent applications.
These activities will ensure that Nanoco remains 
at the forefront of next generation products for the 
display industry.

Other markets
While display was the Group’s primary focus during 
the year, Nanoco continued to develop its other 
target markets of life sciences and specialised 
lighting. The Board has decided that the solar 
assets are non-core and the divestment process 
is progressing with discussions currently ongoing 
with interested parties.
Other markets – life sciences 
Nanoco Life Sciences (“NLS”) is led by Dr Imad 
Nassani, who joined Nanoco in 2009 and is one 
of the pioneers of the use of quantum dots in the 
sector. Quantum dots have favourable optical 
and physical properties compared with organic 
dyes and radioisotopes, but their use in medical 
applications has been hindered due to the 
presence of cadmium. Because Nanoco’s quantum 
dots are free of cadmium, they can be used in the 
human body in, for example, cancer diagnosis and 
surgical imaging. The initial focus of the division is 
on illumination of cancerous tumours to facilitate 
their surgical removal and then, with further 
development, cancer diagnosis. The NLS team has 
made great strides in the development of safe and 
clinically acceptable quantum dot nanomaterials 
based on the Company’s heavy-metal-free 
quantum dot technology. 
The promising outcome from our efforts may be 
used to develop quantum dot probes for the early 
detection of aggressive tumours such as pancreatic 
and bladder cancers. This, in addition to our 
burgeoning relationships with commercial and 
research institutions at the cutting edge of the 
battle against cancer, shows the scope of our 
ambition and the value of our technology.
We are now working to prepare the technology 
for clinical trials. To date Nanoco’s life sciences 
efforts have been grant funded. In early July 2017, 
we announced that we had been awarded an 
Innovate UK grant for a VIVODOTS
TM
 programme 
in conjunction with University College London 
targeting pancreatic cancer.
In September 2017, we announced that we 
had signed a Commercial Supply and License 
Agreement with a US corporation in the field of 
medical devices. Nanoco will supply film product 
and other technologies for light therapy products 
for the treatment of pain, soft tissue injury and 
dermatological conditions such as acne and skin 
anti-ageing.
Other markets – specialised lighting
Nanoco’s CFQDs can tune the colour of light 
emitted by LEDs such that any particular shade of 
light can be produced by tailoring the wavelength. 
This ability to fine-tune the colour of light has very 
broad applications, such as the use of LEDs in homes 
and offices and in specific, niche applications where 
a particular wavelength of light is required.
Nanoco’s commercial strategy in lighting is to focus 
on niche lighting applications which take advantage 
of quantum dots’ unique properties. Lighting products 
for the horticulture and photodynamic therapy 
industries are being developed with partners 
and continue to make headway in line with 
management’s expectations. 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”)
In August 2017, as part of the RoHS Directive, the 
European Commission announced its decision to 
prohibit cadmium in TVs and displays sold in Europe 
from 31 October 2019. Cadmium in lighting products 
was prohibited immediately, although they are not 
commercially available. This was a much needed 
decision, which will provide market certainty as to 
the end date for cadmium to be used in TVs and 
other display products such as monitors. The RoHS 
Directive recognises cadmium as the most 
hazardous heavy metal. We believe that this 
legislation should accelerate the move from 
cadmium to cadmium-free QDs in TVs and displays 
and we are already seeing increased interest from 
the industry. The lack of a decision on the future 
of cadmium led to stronger than anticipated 
competition from non-CFQD solutions.
People
This has been a challenging year for the Company 
and I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
all staff for their hard work and commitment 
throughout the period. 
Post-year end
In October 2017 we announced a placing of 19.99% 
of our issued share capital to raise £8.0 million net 
of expenses. 
This fundraise significantly strengthens Nanoco’s 
balance sheet and puts it on a strong footing for 
the opportunities ahead.
Outlook
The Group continues to make solid progress 
in commercialisation of CFQDs and expects to 
announce further progress from its healthy pipeline 
of projects. With the market developing more slowly 
than originally anticipated, we remain focused on 
careful management of costs ahead of the 
anticipated sales ramp-up. The Board remains 
confident that the opportunity for CFQDs, both in 
display and in other sectors, remains exciting and, 
moreover, that the Company has a competitive 
lead in this technology.
