Chief Executive’s Report
The principal objective for Volga Gas in 
2017 was to effect a transformation in 
the technology used to process the gas 
and condensate at the Dobrinskoye gas 
plant, from which the Group derives the 
overwhelming majority of its production, 
revenue and profits. During 2016 and early 
2017 , after extensive investigations and pilot 
tests, management concluded that a switch 
to Redox-based sweetening would be most 
advantageous – not only for reduced cost 
but also for the elimination of waste material 
that required disposal. This also had the 
advantage that it could be implemented with 
minimal modifications to the existing plant, 
saving significantly on capital expenditure 
that other alternatives would require.
In May 2017 , we commenced the switch 
to Redox processing and from June 
2017 onwards all of the gas processed at 
Dobrinskoye was with Redox. Although the 
change was achieved at low capital cost, 
in the first months after implementation, 
the plant throughput was kept at low 
levels while the process management was 
optimised. Throughput at the gas plant was 
gradually increased and in December 2017 
was averaged 533,000 m
3
 per day (18.8 
mmcf/d). However, the period of lower 
throughput at the gas plant was primarily 
responsible for an overall reduction in Group 
production, being 24% lower than 2016.
Offsetting the reduction in volumes in 
2017 , oil prices and the Russian Ruble both 
recovered steadily through the year and 
consequently the impact of lower sales 
2018 objectives and medium-term 
strategy
Management has the following key objectives 
in 2018:
— To increase the efficiency and processing 
capacity at the gas plant using Redox gas 
sweetening from the rate of 533,000 m
3
 
per day achieved at the end of 2017.
— Having nearly completed construction of 
the LPG plant, to commence production 
and optimise the marketing of the product.
— To complete the reservoir and technical 
studies on the VM field and to commence 
actions including workovers and 
reperforations of the well bores to 
mitigate future formation water 
production, thereby restoring maximum 
gas production and the extraction of 
reserves in place.
— Optimise the production of oil from the 
new horizontal well Uzen #101 and to 
manage the more mature oil wells in 
the field.
Current trading and outlook
Between January and March 2018, Group 
production averaged 4,084 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day, in line with management’s 
plan, given the anticipated higher levels of 
planned maintenance downtime in the period. 
For the coming months, management expects 
to maintain an average daily production of gas 
and condensate in the region of 3,800 boepd, 
resulting in Group production of 
approximately 4,500 boepd, excluding 
incremental volumes from the LPG project, 
which when the project is fully operational is 
expected to add a further 400 boepd. 
International oil prices strengthened 
at the start of 2018 and have remained 
relatively stable. Although it is a minor 
part of the Group’s output, oil production 
has increased as a result of additional 
volumes from the horizontal well Uzen 
#101 which has more than offset the 
natural decline in the mature oil wells.
In the current environment, and at current 
production rates to which may be added 
additional sales of LPG, management expects 
the Group’s financial performance in 2018 
to improve on that of 2017. Meanwhile, 
new capital expenditure commitments 
remain within projected cash generation, 
permitting a resumption of a sustainable 
distribution policy for shareholders.

volumes on the financial performance 
of the Group was less than it may have 
been otherwise. This is discussed in 
greater detail in the Financial Review.
In addition to the switch to Redox gas 
sweetening, the two major projects 
undertaken by Volga Gas during 2017 
were the construction of an LPG unit 
at Dobrinskoye and the drilling of the 
horizontal well Uzen #101 on the Uzen 
oil field in our Karpenskiy licence. These 
projects were the main use of the capital 
investment undertaken by Volga Gas in 2017 
and are expected to contribute materially 
to future revenues and profits. I will cover 
these projects in greater detail below.
Reserves update
Subsequent to the 2017 year end, the 
Company commissioned a new independent 
reserve report by OOO Geostream Assets 
Management (“Geostream”) as, late in 2017 , 
the presence of increased formation water 
was observed during gas production from 
certain of the production wells on the VM 
field. The report, dated 12 April 2018, has 
resulted in a reduction of 27% in the proved 
and of 28% in the proved plus probable 
reserve numbers for the Group’s oil and gas 
reserves. Although the estimate of original 
hydrocarbons in place is unchanged, the 
presence of formation water during gas 
production has led Geostream to apply a 
more conservative calculation of ultimately 
recoverable reserves from the VM field.
Management considers the new reserve 
estimates to be consistent with the currently 
available field data and, accordingly, has 
adopted the revised reserve estimates 
as the Group’s oil, gas and condensate 
reserves for the 2017 year-end accounts. The 
Group’s reserve statement is shown in the 
Operational Review on page 9. The impact 
of the reserve revision has been to increase 
the depletion, depreciation and amortisation 
charge of the Group compared to 2016, with 
consequent reductions in the profit and net 
book value of the Group’s assets. While the 
reserve revisions have not triggered any 
impairment charges, subsequent reserve 
evaluations may or may not lead to further 
revisions which may impair the assets. 
Following the revised reserve estimates that 
have been adopted, we are actively looking 
into technical and operational solutions 
to mitigate the impact of the reserves 
reductions and to maximise gas production 
through the Dobrinskoye gas plant.
