brand highlights
Burberry’s ambition is to bring pioneering British creativity and culture to the world by creating beautifully made products, 
inspiring with storytelling and shared experiences, delivering impeccable and distinctive services, and continually innovating. 
This underpins how Burberry seeks to connect with its customers globally, from runway shows, campaign talent and music

The Burberry brand continues to resonate strongly with luxury consumers around the world, ending the year as one of the  
best known luxury brands globally*.
Key focus areas during the year
Runway shows 
In February 2016, Burberry announced plans to change  
the way it creates, presents and sells its runway collections 
with the launch of its first ‘see-now-buy-now’ runway  
show. From September 2016, Burberry replaced its four-
show calendar of two mens and two womens shows, with 
two shows. The September and February shows featured 
both womenswear and menswear collections. The new 
show format and calendar were designed with a global 
customer in mind. More than 300 stores had three runway 
looks from the February 2017 collection, and the entire 
runway collection was available to purchase in 80 stores 
globally immediately following the runway show. Both the 
September and February collections were also available to 
purchase online as the products were shown on the runway. 
This industry leading change removed the traditional gap 
between the runway show and retail availability.
For the week following the September and February shows, 
the public were invited to visit Makers House, the Burberry 
show venue. In September, Burberry collaborated with The 
New Craftsmen, a selection of Britain’s finest craft makers, 
to create a daily changing programme of activities and 
installations showcasing their original works. In February, 
Burberry partnered with The Henry Moore Foundation to 
create an exhibition of Moore’s working methods and the 
evolution of his iconic sculptural ideas. The exhibition 
featured over 40 of his sculptures, monumental bronzes, 
working models, drawings and maquettes. 
Alongside this, a programme of events featured acoustic 
performances and workshops including life drawing, 
maquette and object making, textile printmaking and  
textile design. Makers House received over 20,000 visitors  
in September and over 30,000 visitors in February. 
Digital innovation 
Burberry is one of the most followed luxury companies  
on social media, with over 48 million followers and the 
brand is present on 20 social platforms including Twitter, 
Instagram, Facebook, Line, Kakao and WeChat. In March 
2017, Burberry was ranked Number 1 Digital Leader in the 
ContactLab Digital Competitive Map. Thirty-two major 
luxury peers were researched for the study and were  
rated across web, email, e-commerce and social media. 
During the year, Burberry launched WeChat commerce  
in China, and created a seamless commerce platform for 
Burberry on Facebook Messenger where customers could 
purchase Burberry products directly through the social 
media platform. Burberry also launched its first commercial 
app for iPhone with exclusive and personalised content. 
Burberry partnered with Snapchat for its February show  
by filming rehearsals, backstage activities and the Show 
itself using Snapchat Spectacles.
At the February Makers House show, Burberry built a 
portrait studio, a set inspired by Henry Moore’s studio. 
Guests were invited to have their portrait taken in the  
studio and share the image and GIF (animated image)  
on social media. This generated over four million 
impressions on social media in one week.

inspired styles for men and women. Each design is made 
from Burberry’s new trench leather, which is embossed 
with the pattern of gabardine by using special plates 
developed to create a unique leather finish. In May 2017, 
Burberry partnered with Mr. Bags, a Chinese influencer,  
for the exclusive WeChat shop launch of the DK88 in  
bright toffee colour.
