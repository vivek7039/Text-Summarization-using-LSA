CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to introduce the 2017 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements. During 2017, the Group has made very 
promising progress in the development of its MEX-GOL, SV 
and VAS gas and condensate fields in north-eastern Ukraine, 
with significant improvements in production rates, leading to  
a much improved financial performance. 
At the Group’s MEX-GOL and SV fields, production was 
reasonably stable during the first half of 2017, but in June 
2017, the new MEX-109 well, utilising improved drilling 
and completion techniques developed as a result of recent 
studies, was completed successfully and put on production, 
and in August 2017, following completion of its workover, 
the SV-2 well was also put on production. Together, these 
successes have nearly doubled output from the MEX-GOL 
and SV fields. In addition, the VAS field has continued to 
produce consistently during the year. With the improved 
contribution from the new wells on the MEX-GOL and SV 
fields, aggregate production at the end of 2017 from all fields 
was approximately 2,800 boepd. This compares with an 
aggregate production rate of approximately 1,700 boepd at 
the end of 2016, which represents an increase of nearly 65% 
over the year.
The fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine continues 
to improve, with a better economic outlook, GDP growth 
and improved stability in the Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange 
rates, although the inflation rate did increase moderately. 
Nevertheless, there continue to be stresses in the economy 
and weaknesses in the Ukrainian banking sector.
The Ukrainian Government has implemented a number of 
reforms in the oil and gas industry in recent years, which 
include the deregulation of the gas supply market in late 2015, 
and more recently, reductions in the subsoil tax rates relating 
to oil and gas production and a proposed simplification of the 
regulatory procedures applicable to oil and gas exploration 
and production activities in Ukraine. 
The deregulation of the gas supply market, supported 
by electronic gas trading platforms and improved pricing 
transparency, has meant that the market gas prices in Ukraine 
now broadly correlate with the imported gas prices. During 
2017, gas prices were reasonably stable, allowing for some 
seasonal variation, and were higher than in 2016. Furthermore, 
condensate and LPG prices were also higher in 2017 by 
comparison with the previous year.
As regards the Group’s financial performance in the year 
ended 31 December 2017, I am pleased to report that 
the Group made a profit of $2.3 million (2016: $1.3 million 
loss), mainly as a result of improved revenues from higher 
production volumes and hydrocarbon prices. Cash generated 
from operations during the year was higher at $18.0 million 
(2016: $10.0 million). 
Board and Management Changes
During the year, there were significant changes to the 
management and Board of Directors of the Company. With 
effect from the start of August 2017, Sergii Glazunov became 
Chief Executive Officer, having previously been Finance 
Director, and Yevhen (Gene) Palyenka was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer. Later in August 2017, Bruce Burrows joined 
the Board as Non-Executive Director, and Adrian Coates 
stepped down from the Board at the same time.
I joined the Board as Non-Executive Director in September 
2017, and was appointed Non-Executive Chairman in October 
2017. At the same time, Phil Frank joined the Board as Non-
Executive Director, and Keith Henry and Alastair Graham 
stepped down from the Board. On behalf of the Board,  
I would like to thank each of Keith, Alastair and Adrian for 
their valued contributions during their respective tenures with 
the Company.
Outlook
While there are still challenges in the business environment in 
Ukraine, the situation is improving and the Group is continuing 
to progress the development of its Ukrainian fields. After the 
operational successes of 2017 and the increased production 
output during the year, we are looking forward to achieving 
further successes in the development activities planned for 
2018 and delivering a steadily increasing production and 
revenue stream in the future.
In conclusion, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all 
of our staff for the continued dedication and support they have 
shown during the year.
