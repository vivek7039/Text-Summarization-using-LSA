AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
AVEVA DELIVERED A RESILIENT PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET GROWTH, STRENGTHENING 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, WINNING NEW CUSTOMERS AND 
DEVELOPING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO.
I am pleased to report that AVEVA 
delivered a resilient performance 
during 2016/17 , despite two of our key 
end markets, Oil & Gas and Marine, 
remaining subdued. Revenue increased 
7 .1% to £215.8 million (2016 – £201.5 
million) assisted by currency translation 
and profit before tax was £46.9 million 
(2016 – £29.4 million), supported by 
strong cost discipline. On an adjusted 
basis, profit before tax grew 7 .4% to 
£55.0 million (2016 – £51.2 million). 
The Group also increased cash from 
operating activities by 58.2% to  
£57 .2 million (2016 – £36.1 million). 
We are maintaining our progressive 
dividend policy and propose to 
increase the total dividend for the 
year to 40.0 pence per share (2016 
– 36.0 pence). This represents an 
increase of 11.1% over the prior year, 
underpinned by our confidence in the 
long-term prospects for the business.
AVEVA’s net cash position at the year 
end grew to £130.9 million  
(2016 – £107 .9 million). The Board 
believes that it is important to maintain 
a strong balance sheet. This gives our 
customers confidence in the strength 
of our business and allows us to have  
at hand sufficient resources to  
invest in AVEVA’s future growth, for 
example, by investing in Research & 
Development and capitalising on 
acquisition opportunities as they 
become available.
Delivering on our strategy
In addition to delivering solid 
results, we have remained focused 
on executing upon our strategy, in 
order to position AVEVA to achieve 
growth well into the future.
AVEVA achieved good momentum in 
sales of products beyond the core 3D 
design software that currently makes 
up the majority of our revenue. We 
also made good progress with our 
strategy of increasing our sales to 
Owner Operators (OOs), growth in 
the key North American market and 
in broadening our market exposure 
outside of Oil & Gas and Marine. For 
example, during the year we had 
considerable success in the Power 
market, winning contracts with 
companies including KEPCO E&C, 
Southern Company and TerraPower.
These successes were made possible 
by the strength of our technologies 
and people. We continued to 
enhance our existing products and 
develop new offerings during the year 
through our development centres 
in Cambridge and Hyderabad. 
Board developments
At the end of 2016, after 33 years 
with the Group and 17 years as Chief 
Executive, Richard Longdon stepped 
down from his role as Chief Executive 
and as a Director of the Company. 
Richard oversaw the most successful 
phase in AVEVA’s history and was 
the driving force in developing it 
into a global company. The Board 
and I are grateful to Richard for his 
contribution to AVEVA’s success.

We were delighted to appoint James 
Kidd as Deputy Chief Executive 
in July and as Richard’s successor 
as Chief Executive from 1 January 
2017 . James had been Chief 
Financial Officer and a member of 
the Board since January 2011.
We were also pleased to appoint 
David Ward to the Board as James’ 
successor in the role of Chief Financial 
Officer in July. David had been Head 
of Finance at AVEVA since 2011.
James and David were both key to 
developing AVEVA’s strategy and I 
have been impressed with the sharp 
focus that they have demonstrated 
in executing it in their new roles.
We also had changes within our Non-
Executive team. Jonathan Brooks and 
Philip Dayer both reached their nine-
year tenures during the year. Jonathan 
stepped down from the Board in 
November 2016 and Philip will retire 
at the AGM in July 2017 . I would like 
to thank them both on behalf of the 
Board for their contributions to AVEVA.
We welcomed two new Non-Executives 
to the Board. Christopher Humphrey 
joined the Board in July 2016 and 
assumed the role of Chair of the Audit 
Committee in November. Rohinton 
(Ron) Mobed was appointed to the 
Board in March 2017 . Christopher and 
Ron have a wealth of technology and 
information management experience, 
which will add further breadth and 
depth to the skills of the Board.
Summary
AVEVA is now in its 50th year, having 
been founded in 1967 as a government-
funded research institute created by 
the then UK Ministry of Technology at 
Cambridge University. The Company’s 
original mission, to develop computer-
aided design techniques for use by 
British industry, has been achieved 
and indeed greatly exceeded.
The Group now operates in more 
than 30 countries across the globe 
and provides the design technology 
that has created some of the 
world’s largest and most complex 
engineering assets. As I look ahead, 
the opportunities are as exciting as 
they have ever been, as industries 
look to drive efficiencies by adopting 
a Digital Asset approach throughout 
the life cycle of the physical asset.
We will continue to target growth, 
strengthening customer relationships, 
winning new customers in new areas 
and developing our product portfolio.
AVEVA’s progress would not be possible 
without the hard work and dedication 
of all our employees. The Board would 
like to express its sincere thanks for 
their considerable efforts. We would 
also like to thank our customers, 
shareholders and other stakeholders 
for their continued support.
