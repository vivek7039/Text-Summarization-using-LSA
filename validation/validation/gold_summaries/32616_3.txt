Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report 
Chairman’s statement
Strongly positioned 
for success
I am pleased to introduce the 
Group’s Annual Report and 
Accounts for the year ended  
31 January 2017 (‘FY17’). FY17 
has been a year of significant 
change where some difficult but 
ultimately necessary decisions 
have been made to put the 
Group on a path to realising its 
considerable potential.
Despite having only been Chairman since 
October 2016, it is already clear to me that the 
Group benefits from a first-class infrastructure 
and talented workforce who are committed  
to upholding the highest standards of quality  
and service as the Group strives to deliver  
on its strategy.
Although we announced in October 2016 that 
the expected FY17 outturn would be lower 
than previously anticipated, I am pleased to 
report that the Group has delivered on the 
revised forecast of £10.1m adjusted EBITDA. 
Revenue grew by 28% to £88.8m and the 
Group’s net debt position was substantially 
reduced to £13.0m following a £15.0m equity 
fundraise that was completed in November 
2016. I am grateful for the continued support 
and confidence shown by our major 
shareholders in the Group’s prospects that 
this considerable fundraise serves to highlight.
Focused and simplified strategy
The premise on which the Company listed  
on AIM in December 2014 remains intact.  
The Group is seeking to leverage its market-
leading position in the manufacture, procurement 
and supply of unlicensed medicines (‘specials’) 
and special obtains in the UK and use it  
as a platform to license and commercialise  
a pipeline of the top specials.
The Group is therefore closely aligned to  
the Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency’s (‘MHRA’) aim of reducing 
clinical risk by subjecting medicines to the 
licensing process and effectively moving  
them up the UK prescribing hierarchy.  
The component parts of the hierarchy  
are more fully explained on page 6.
Much of the Group’s strategy over the past 
five years has been to equip itself with the 
capabilities needed to fully address this 
hierarchy through both organic growth and 
selective acquisitions.
Quantum Pharmaceutical is now the market 
leader in the UK for the manufacture and 
supply of specials and special obtains; UL 
Medicines is number two in the UK market for 
sourcing and supplying imported medicines 
licensed abroad; Lamda is a leading specialist 
development, formulation and licensing 
business capable of guiding products through 
the licensing process; and Colonis is an expert 
product development and commercialisation 
business equipped to take unlicensed-to-
licensed (‘UL2L ’) products to market. These 
components are in place, are fully integrated 
and are key to future growth.
We must now focus on what we do well. 
Some of the Group’s difficulties this year are 
rooted in persevering with products where  
it has not been first to market. The sales and 
marketing capability needed to successfully 
launch products into such a marketplace  
is considerable and the expertise needed  
to compete effectively against incumbent 
product offerings is not a core competency  
of the Group. It would require substantial 
investment and time in advance of securing 
meaningful revenues for the Group to build 
this capability. 5

Strategic report 
The essence of the Group’s focused and 
simplified strategy is therefore to prioritise and 
concentrate its own launch efforts on UL2L 
products where it has first-mover advantage, 
and on larger niche generic non-UL2L 
products where there is a market opportunity. 
Meanwhile, we will seek to partner with 
businesses who specialise in marketing other 
types of non-UL2L products to fulfil the 
potential of the remainder of the portfolio.
The launch of Glycopyrronium Bromide Oral 
Solution 1mg/5ml (‘Glyco’) in August 2016 is a 
blueprint for the type of UL2L development and 
launch that is now our priority. I am encouraged 
by the way we executed on the launch and that 
Glyco’s sales performance has subsequently 
been in line with our pre-launch estimates. This 
bodes well for future UL2L launches and I am 
excited by some of the products in our pipeline 
that display similar characteristics to Glyco in 
terms of our estimate of their market opportunity.
The Group has also taken action this year  
to remove distractions and address 
underperforming businesses. The most 
significant example of these is NuPharm, 
which ceased trading in January 2017 
following a period of sustained operating 
losses. Although this decision was taken  
with great regret, the profitability profile of  
the Group is much stronger as a result and 
management are now wholly focused on 
growing the core Specials and Niche divisions.
It is critically important that all our resources 
and efforts are geared towards making our 
focused and simplified strategy a success  
and that there are no other distractions.
Corporate governance
The Board values corporate governance highly 
and believes that it is integral to the delivery  
of the Group’s strategy, to the generation of 
shareholder value and to the safeguarding  
of the long-term interests of its stakeholders.
As Chairman, I am responsible for the 
leadership of the Board and for ensuring its 
effectiveness in all aspects of this role. The 
Board is responsible for the Group’s strategic 
development, monitoring and achievement of 
its business objectives, oversight of risk and 
maintaining a system of effective corporate 
governance. More information about our 
corporate governance controls and processes 
is contained within the Directors’ report 
starting on page 28.
Board changes
During the year we announced a number of 
changes to the Board. Following the 
resignation of Martin Such as Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’) on 7 March 2016, Chris Rigg 
was appointed as his replacement.
On 12 July 2016 Andrew Scaife tendered his 
resignation as Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) 
and left his role on 29 July 2016 following 
which Chris Rigg was appointed Acting  
CEO on 1 August 2016. Chris was appointed 
permanent CEO on 19 October 2016 
alongside a new Board comprising myself, 
Dr John Brown as Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director and Christopher Mills 
as Non-executive Director. John Clarke and 
Sheila Kelly resigned from their roles as 
Non-executive Chairman and Non-executive 
Director respectively.
Gerard Murray was appointed CFO on 
23 January 2017, succeeding Chris Rigg,  
who had been performing both roles since 
1 August 2016.
Dividend
The Board has proposed not to pay a final 
dividend for FY17 as the Group intends to 
reinvest its profits to progress development  
of the product pipeline as rapidly as possible.
Our employees and stakeholders
We rely on the skills, experience and 
commitment of our team to drive the business 
forward. Their enthusiasm, innovation and 
perseverance remain key assets of the Group 
and are critical for its future success. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all  
of our employees, customers, suppliers and 
stakeholders for their continued support over 
the last year. 
Summary
This year’s results draw a line under the past 
performance of the Group. They mark the 
transition to a more focused and simplified 
business led by a new Board, and demonstrate 
real progress in executing our strategy. The 
Board is confident in the future prospects of 
the Group and we look forward to reporting on 
further strategic progress as we move forward.
