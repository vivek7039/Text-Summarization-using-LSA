 STRATEGIC REPORT
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
of this Division over the last four years is one of GAP’s major 
successes, and much praise goes to the management team  
and all Divisional colleagues for this achievement. 
This business is now more focused on customers and markets, 
with strength in subscriptions supported by a revitalised Consulting 
business and an exciting marketing services capability through 
Informa Engage. It has all the tools and talent to continue to 
steadily improve its growth profile in the coming years. 
The Academic Publishing Division, under the leadership of  
new Divisional CEO Annie Callanan, also reported improved 
underlying revenue growth at +2.0%, with revenues of £530m 
and adjusted operating profit of £154m.
This included another robust performance by our scholarly 
journals business, with high subscription renewals reflecting 
continued strong demand for our content. In our specialist  
Books business, a number of operational initiatives to improve 
publication efficiency and customer service supported 
performance, and, combined with a more stable market 
backdrop, led to positive growth over 2017 . 
Towards the end of the year, we further reduced our exposure  
to the more volatile end of the Books market through the sale  
of lower level textbook publisher Garland, which should help 
further stabilise the Books business in 2018.
We continued to invest in new growth opportunities through 
2017 , particularly in digital, data and open access (OA). In  
May, we invested in colwiz, a business developing research 
management software using artificial intelligence and machine 
learning technology. In September, we announced the addition  
of Dove Medical Press, a leading independent OA publisher, 
strengthening our position in Health Sciences and adding a 
valuable portfolio of established OA journals, and a platform  
for future expansion in this attractive and growing market. 
The Knowledge & Networking Division returned to positive 
growth in 2017 , with an underlying growth rate of 0.1%, reversing 
a decline of -4.1% in 2016. This follows four years of significant 
change designed to simplify the portfolio and focus the business 
on large, branded, international confexes and events in three  
key vertical markets, Life Sciences, Global Finance and TMT.  
In November, we completed the sale of a majority stake in 
Euroforum, our German and Swiss conference business, further 
increasing the focus on our major brands in core verticals.
Knowledge & Networking’s investment in digital communities, 
and in connecting audiences year round through networks and 
specialist content, continued to gather pace through the year  
and this is one of the areas where we expect to see more growth 
in 2018 and beyond.
A common feature across all the Operating Divisions is the 
continuous reassessment of business mix and proactive 
management of the portfolio to improve growth prospects, 
profitability and earnings quality. Much has been achieved to 
reshape the Group through GAP and this is reflected in its 
improving performance. We will maintain this focus in the  
future, continuing to reassess select non-core businesses  
to test whether we remain their best long-term owner.
INVESTING FOR GROWTH AND SCALE
The improving performance of the Group and Operating Divisions  
is in no small part due to the programme of investment and 
portfolio improvement undertaken as part of GAP.
Over the last four years, around £80m has been invested  
in a range of projects in all four Operating Divisions, as well as 
centrally in Global Support. These have focused on technology 
that enhances Informa’s core platforms, ranging from customer 
management systems and marketing automation tools to 
front-end delivery platforms. This has strengthened the Group’s 
capabilities, supporting the steady improvement in underlying 
performance and the delivery of consistent future growth and 
further scale. 
In 2017 , this GAP investment started to reap dividends, with a 
range of new products and platform enhancements launched. 
This was particularly evident in Business Intelligence, with 
upgrades and launches including improved data collection,  
new API functionality and full platform launches. 
These included a new platform for EPFR Global, our fund  
flow and asset allocation data business, the launch of Ovum 
Forecaster, a new product combining forecasts on broadband, 
cellular and TV services and technologies, and a new platform  
for Citeline, our clinical trials intelligence business, with a new 
web interface providing full access to data on more than  
265,000 trials and 400,000 investigators.
Elsewhere, in Academic Publishing, a single, enhanced 
platform for scholarly books content was introduced. In  
Global Exhibitions, the development and rollout of our 
MarkitMakr digital lead generation platform continued, as  
did the core digital platform in Knowledge & Networking.  
More details can be found in the Divisional review section. 
COMBINING AND INTEGRATING NEW BUSINESSES
Having acquired Penton Information Services, at the  
end of 2016, 2017 saw a multi-faceted integration 
programme to combine Penton’s 1,000 colleagues, 
exhibitions, intelligence brands and print and digital  
B2B insight and data products with Informa’s business 
structure, culture and commercial operations. 
DELIVER – DISCOVER – COMBINE
Planning for the integration started well in advance of the 
deal completing, but the initial focus for all the Informa and 
Penton teams remained on meeting year-end targets. At 
the same time, management teams prioritised discovering 
more about Penton and testing assumptions made around 
where and how each part of Penton’s business might best fit  
within Informa’s portfolio. 
The project moved into its Combine phase in early 2017, 
when the formal integration of businesses, people, culture 
and systems got underway. 
COLLABORATION AND GOVERNANCE
A steering committee was established to oversee and 
monitor the programme, led by Chief Integration Officer 
and Business Intelligence CEO Patrick Martell and 
comprising the CEOs of Global Exhibitions and Knowledge 
& Networking, the Director of Strategy & Planning, Director 
of Talent & Transformation and the Business Intelligence 
HR Director. The committee was supported by a dedicated 
project manager and met bi-weekly to discuss progress 
reports, agree key integration actions and collaborate on 
cross-business matters.
Each Division established workstreams to manage 
decisions and activity around commercial, marketing  
and financial integration, with sponsors and leads 
accountable for reporting progress and escalating issues. 
HR, technology and brand integration were managed at  
a cross-Group level by Global Support functional experts, 
to ensure a common approach was adopted in areas 
affecting all Divisions. 
PACE AND PROGRESS
The speed of combination varied by workstream, with 
priority given to the integration of key brands into vertical 
portfolios to allow commercial teams to quickly identify 
and seize revenue opportunities. 
To ensure minimal disruption to working practices and 
enable a more detailed period of discovery, Technology  
and HR changes were phased over the year. In HR, the 
integration provided an opportunity to rethink US payroll 
and benefits systems across Informa, and we took a number 
of steps to standardise and consolidate our processes in 
areas like time recording, holiday practices and benefit 
contributions for all US colleagues starting 2018.

In technology, colleagues from Penton were gradually 
incorporated into Informa’s environment, including 
onboarding to the Group’s digital workspace Portal in  
July 2017. While we complete the rollout of our new  
Group-wide ERP, certain legacy Penton platforms  
remain in place to support their operations. 
Project Manager Helena Redshaw (above) said: “The 
integration project started from a positive place, as  
cultural fit was an important part of the rationale for 
combining our businesses, and there was a strong  
appetite amongst colleagues to come together as  
one business and community. 
“There were lots of learnings along the way that we have 
fed back into our change management processes, including 
building in the flexibility to allow different workstreams to 
move quicker where they can, and ensuring colleagues are 
kept up to date on progress throughout the programme.”

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
/ /As the Group enters 2018,  
GAP may be complete, but  
its principles will continue to 
underpin how the business is 
managed and operated/ /
During 2017 , as in every year, I have been fortunate to spend  
time meeting customers and key business partners to hear  
their needs and experiences first hand. This helps to understand 
the direction and growth opportunities for their businesses and 
how we might be able to support this progress by enhancing  
and extending the specialist intelligence, content, connections  
and sales opportunities we provide. 
Highlights included meeting exhibitors at World of Concrete  
in the Construction & Real Estate vertical, touring the vast and 
impressive Fort Lauderdale Boat Show, hosting a reception  
with the government-sponsored Egyptian Knowledge Bank to 
promote our scholarly research and other activities in the region, 
and leading a panel of experts at the LeadersIn Tech Summit  
as part of London Tech Week. 
It was also encouraging to strengthen and extend our relationship 
with one of our key partners, the Principality of Monaco, during 
2017 . This saw us expand our existing partnership on the 
Monaco Yacht Show to our full international yachting portfolio, 
including the US-based events acquired with YPI in March.
AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLATFORM FOR 
GROWTH AND SCALE
Another area of investment and platform improvement in 2017 
has been the upgrade to our Group-wide financial reporting 
system, creating a common, more robust platform with the 
capabilities to provide efficient and effective shared services  
at scale. 
Like all large-scale technology deployments, this has been 
complex to manage, with some implementation challenges as 
legacy systems have been retired. However, the vast majority  
of the Group is now live on the platform and there is a target  
to achieve a business as usual state on the platform by the  
end of May, ahead of the half-year reporting period and before 
the anticipated completion of the offer for UBM plc.
INVESTING IN COLLEAGUES AND INCLUSION
The energy, ideas and contribution of colleagues across the 
world remain the lifeblood of our business and so the Group’s 
investment in people, and the support and opportunities available 
to them, remains critical. 
This is reflected in the range of benefits available to all colleagues, 
which includes our colleague equity/share incentive plan 
ShareMatch. Participation continues to grow, with close to  
20% of colleagues now members, boosted by an improved 
one-for-one share matching offer introduced in 2017 . 
I particularly enjoyed spending extended periods of time in the 
US during the second half of 2017 , meeting colleagues in small 
and large groups to hear personal experiences from around 
Informa, answering questions and having great discussions  
on our business and its future direction. 
Alongside such informal discussions, the Group has a more 
formal colleague engagement platform, Inside Informa. This 
enables colleagues to have their say on everything at Informa, 
providing valuable feedback that drives change and action,  
as well as being a useful measure of overall engagement levels. 
For example, following the Inside Informa conversation in 2016,  
new learning and development programmes were launched  
in several Divisions to provide greater opportunities for 
professional and personal advancement. 
To supplement this, a shorter, topic-focused Inside Informa  
Pulse was introduced in 2017 , in this case giving colleagues  
the chance to have their say on GAP. Encouragingly, 75% who 
expressed an opinion believed their business was now better 
placed to succeed, and the most commonly cited benefits of 
GAP were new and upgraded technology and opportunities  
to progress and develop personally. 
Informa continues to invest in the balance of talent at all levels 
across the Group, and our twin areas of focus are international 
diversity and gender mix. As the Group becomes increasingly 
international in reach, it is important colleagues around the world 
feel they have equal opportunities to succeed and progress.
Similarly, we have launched new initiatives to promote gender 
balance, including enhanced recommended recruitment practices. 
2018 will see the launch of AllInforma Balance, a network to support 
the skills and development of all colleagues, with certain elements 
specifically tailored to women. 
Informa has a balanced workforce overall, but female 
representation is lower in more senior roles. We will continue  
to  strive to provide the right support and encouragement  
for female colleagues to ensure they have every opportunity  
to progress through the Group.
GROWTH CONTINUATION AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES
The completion of the GAP leaves the Group more robust, customer-
focused and better equipped to deliver sustainable growth and 
performance. Informa has delivered on key GAP objectives:
•  We have built a scale position in B2B events and will,  
if the offer for UBM is successful, become one of the  
largest B2B events groups globally
•  We have expanded our presence and built a strong position  
in the important US market 
•  We have repaired our Business Intelligence Division and 
returned it to positive organic growth from its starting point  
of close to a 10% decline
•  We have streamlined and focused our Knowledge & 
Networking Division, returning it to positive growth in 2017
• We have built depth in a range of attractive vertical markets 
•  We have strengthened core capabilities across the Group, 
investing in enhanced platforms and infrastructure, and the 
talent and expertise to innovate and serve customers 
This provides a strong foundation for the future, and it is our  
belief there is much more for the Group to achieve. Our markets 
are attractive and growing, often fragmented and international: 
the ingredients for continued growth and scale in the future. 
As the Group enters 2018, GAP may be complete, but its 
principles will continue to underpin how the business is  
managed and operated. We will continue to invest in the 
business, encouraging innovation and expansion, and remain 
focused on our customers and the verticals in which they 
operate. We will retain our eagerness for growth, not at any  
cost, but growth that delivers value, creates opportunities  
and drives returns for our Shareholders.
This is why, in January 2018, the Board of Informa agreed a 
recommended offer for UBM plc, an opportunity to build on  
the foundations of GAP and create a leading B2B information 
services group, with the operating scale, industry specialisation 
and operational capabilities to deliver long-term growth and value. 
It is an exciting prospect for the future, one that offers major 
benefits for customers, new opportunities for colleagues and  
the potential to create significant value for Shareholders. I look 
forward to keeping everyone updated and informed on progress 
through the year ahead. 
My thanks to the Board and all my Informa colleagues who  
have put such energy and commitment into delivering on  
our GAP ambitions and for putting the Group in such a  
strong and exciting position for the future.
