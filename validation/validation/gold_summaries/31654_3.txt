 I am delighted to report that easyHotel 
has made great progress in implementing 
its strategy for growth. Strong trading 
across both the existing estate and the 
Group’s newly opened hotels has delivered 
increases not only in total systems sales 
but like-for-like revenues as well.
Strategy
We continue to target carefully selected locations 
to build our portfolio of owned and franchised 
hotels, adopting a methodical approach to the 
assessment of individual pipeline opportunities 
and applying strict investment return criteria. 
In addition, a number of initiatives have been 
progressed during the year to optimise the value 
of existing assets including investments to improve 
our revenue management systems and processes 
and our customers’ online booking experience.
The equity capital and bank debt we raised 
last year have enabled us to commit to a strong 
pipeline of new sites. Following recent acquisitions 
those funds are now substantially committed. 
Further refinements to our hotel development 
processes and design standards will deliver a 
lower risk, higher performing model for new 
projects. During the year, two new owned 
hotels have been opened in Birmingham and 
Manchester and both are trading strongly. 
Since the year end, our new owned hotel in 
Liverpool was opened on 1 November 2017 
and further projects are in progress in Newcastle, 
Barcelona, Leeds, Sheffield, Ipswich, Oxford and 
Cardiff. This significant increase in our owned 
estate, together with new franchised hotels 
opened in Brussels, Amsterdam Arena and 
Amsterdam Zaandam (and with others on 
the way), is providing an ever more solid 
foundation for our strengthening brand.
The benefit of our “new look” room design is 
evidenced by the above-budget performance 
we are seeing from our newly launched hotels 
which continue to exceed our own expectations. 
A programme to refresh two of three legacy owned 
assets (Croydon and Glasgow) will be completed 
within the coming months and we expect to see 
a similar positive impact on the revenues of those 
hotels. In addition, we have plans to upgrade 
our London Old Street 92-room hotel and, 
subject to planning consent, exploit the value 
of the remainder of the building through 
development of office accommodation.
Dividend
An interim dividend of 0.1 1p per ordinary share 
was paid on 30 June 2017 . The Board is now 
pleased to recommend to shareholders the 
payment of a final dividend of 0.22p per share 
on the basis of our enlarged share capital. Subject 
to shareholder approval at our forthcoming AGM, 
this dividend will be paid on 15 February 2018 to 
shareholders on the register on 19 January 2018.
Board and management team
The Board would like to thank everyone in 
easyHotel’s team for their part in delivering 
another successful year for the business. 
In particular, the Company has benefited 
from continuity within our skilled executive 
team. Chief Executive Officer, Guy Parsons, 
and Chief Financial Officer, Marc Vieilledent, 
bring a wealth of sector experience, hard 
work and commitment that enable us to 
make considerable progress. We are very 
fortunate to have Scott Christie’s wise and 
pragmatic contribution as Non-Executive 
Director and Chairman of our Audit and 
Remuneration Committees.
Outlook
Whilst the wider macroeconomic uncertainty 
continues to impact consumer confidence, 
we believe easyHotel is well positioned. 
The refinements that have been introduced 
to the business over the course of the last year 
are further strengthening our brand and ensuring 
that the easyHotel offering is one that can 
support delivery of the Board’s ambitious 
long-term strategy for growth.
