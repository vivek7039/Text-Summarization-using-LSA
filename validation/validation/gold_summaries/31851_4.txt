STRATEGIC REPORT 
AT A GLANCE
Strong cash generation and investment to 
deliver rollout of both the Revolución de Cuba 
and Revolution brands.
Our Revolution bars have been trading since 
1996 and are a destination of choice for 
customers who value a premium drinks and 
food-led offering.
Each Revolution bar has its own character, 
individual design and layout, with bar interiors 
tailored on a site-by-site basis to utilise the 
space available and the best attributes of the 
architecture of each bar.
The success of our Revolution brand is driven by 
our customers’ desire to be entertained outside 
of their homes in highly invested, exciting, quality, 
contemporary environments. The principal 
revenue streams are generated from our wide 
range of premium cocktails and drinks and our 
lunchtime and evening food offerings.
New Revolución de Cubas at Harrogate, Aberdeen, Reading and Glasgow were 
opened in the first half of the period, and were followed by two new Revolutions 
in Southend and Torquay in the final quarter.
The bar design differs from the Revolution 
concept, with Revolución de Cuba bars being 
characterised by their 1940s Cuban-inspired 
style, with dark woods, traditional bar counters, 
antique tiles, vintage furniture, Havana-style 
ceiling fans and original Cuban artwork and 
photographs, with each bar tailored to give 
it an individual character.
The success of our Revolución de Cuba brand 
is driven by the Cuban-inspired premium 
proposition offering cocktails, food and live music 
to a wide range of customers. The principal 
revenue streams are generated from our rum-led 
cocktail range coupled with a Spanish and 
Mexican-based tapas-inspired food menu and 
authentic live Latin music and entertainment.
