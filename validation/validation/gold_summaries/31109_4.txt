OUR NEW GROUP
Our business is divided into two divisions: pharmaceuticals and wholesale.
Overview
Products are supplied to animal health professionals both 
directly or through national distribution networks and fall 
into two categories: regulated pharmaceuticals and over 
the counter products. Products are either owned by the 
Group or on distribution from third parties. The Group 
invests significantly in its in-house development pipeline. 
The portfolio is very broad with over 300 products including 
pharmaceuticals, vaccines, biocides and nutraceuticals. 
The Group focuses on certain niche therapy areas including 
odontology, dermatology, otology and surgery/anaesthesia.
Overview
Medini is the wholesaling division based close to Bruges, 
supplying medical, veterinary and paramedical products to 
veterinary professionals throughout Belgium. The business 
has been trading for 25 years and is well established in this 
stable market. The extensive range of over 5,000 products 
includes own label and branded items ranging from small 
disposable items to larger capital equipment and diagnostic 
instruments. The company is a specialist in the supply of 
surgical instruments.
