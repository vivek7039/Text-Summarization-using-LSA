Chief Executive Officer’s review
2018 starts with two pieces of 
significant news. 
As previously announced, we have 
appointed a new Chairman, 
Rob Woodward, who joined Ebiquity 
on 1 March. Rob succeeds Michael 
Higgins who will retire after 12 years 
as Chairman of Ebiquity, following the 
AGM on 9 May.
Rob brings a wealth of both media 
and senior Board-level experience to 
Ebiquity. He was CEO of STV Group 
plc for nearly 11 years where he led 
their successful transformation into a 
pre-eminent digital media group. Prior 
to joining STV, Rob was Commercial 
Director at Channel 4 Television for 
four years and was previously a 
Managing Director with UBS 
Corporate Finance and lead partner 
for Deloitte’s TMT industry group in 
Europe. Rob is an experienced leader 
who has an inspiring track record in 
building teams and delivering 
successful outcomes. His approach 
and personality are a great fit for 
Ebiquity and I am looking forward to 
partnering with him.
I would like to express our deep 
gratitude to Michael Higgins for his 
significant contribution over the past 
12 years, where his guidance has been 
invaluable in the successful 
development of the Company. We wish 
him all the very best for the future. 
Additionally, in February 2018, we 
announced that we had entered into 
an agreement to sell our Advertising 
Intelligence business to Nielsen. The 
sale is subject to UK Competition and 
Markets Authority (‘CMA’) approval, and 
completion is anticipated to take place in 
the second quarter of 2018, assuming 
the CMA provides clearance following its 
high-level Phase 1 examination. If the 
CMA instead refer the transaction for a 
more detailed Phase 2 investigation, the 
completion would likely take place in Q4 
2018. The Advertising Intelligence 
business represents in excess of 90% of 
the reported revenue and underlying 
operating profit within the Market 
Intelligence (‘MI’) segment, and 25% 
of Group revenues and contributed 
£4.4 million to operating profit before 
allocation of overheads, and for this 
reason we refer in places of this report 
to revenue growth excluding the 
MI segment.
2017 financial  
performance overview
Revenues for the year to 31 December 
2017 grew 4.6% to £87.4 million. With 
the majority of revenue denominated 
in non-sterling currencies, revenue was 
boosted by sterling being on average 
weaker against the euro and the dollar 
in 2017 than in 2016. In total, currency 
movements benefited revenue by 3.4%, 
with acquisitions further increasing 
revenue by 0.4%. This resulted in 
like-for-like, constant currency revenue 
growth of 0.8%.
Excluding performance of the MI 
segment, which contains the Advertising 
Intelligence business, revenue growth 
was 6.7% and 2.3% on a like-for-like, 
constant currency basis. Revenue was 
more evenly phased across 2017 than 
in 2016, when revenue was front-half 
weighted. Like-for-like, constant 
currency revenue growth was 5.5% in 
the second half of 2017 compared with 
the second half of 2016. 
“ I would like to express our deep gratitude 
to Michael Higgins for his significant 
contribution over the past 12 years, where 
his guidance has been invaluable in the 
successful development of the Company. 
   We wish him all the very best  
for the future.”
10 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 As previously highlighted, revenue 
performance from the US business 
was well below management 
expectations, and this impacted the 
Group’s revenue growth year-on-year. 
In our US MVM segment (excluding 
FirmDecisions, our contract 
compliance business), the trend we 
observed in the first half of the year of 
clients facing cuts to their marketing 
and advertising budgets and 
consequently deferring Media 
benchmarking spending, continued 
into the second half.
In the US MPO business unit, after 
delivering greater than 50% revenue 
growth between 2014 and 2016, 
revenue declined in 2017. The US MPO 
business had a high concentration of 
revenue with a small number of clients. 
The two biggest clients reduced spend 
– mainly driven by internal 
reorganisations – which caused 
revenue to fall by 19.8% in 2017. US 
MPO revenues were higher in H2 2017 
than H1 2017, through the addition of 
new clients in Q4 2017. Given the scale 
of the US advertising market, and our 
relative size, we feel positive about our 
mid- to long-term opportunities. With 
new leadership of our US MPO and US 
Media business units now in place we 
expect to see a sustained turnaround 
in 2018. Excluding the performance of 
the US MVM and MPO segment (but 
including US FirmDecisions), the MVM 
and MPO segments grew by 10.0% 
and 7.4% respectively on a like-for-like, 
constant currency basis.
The MVM segment reported revenue 
up 9.2%, an increase of 5.2% on a 
like-for-like, constant currency basis. 
As clients focused on the issue of 
media transparency, this significantly 
benefited FirmDecisions, which 
recorded exceptional revenue growth 
in 2017. Outside of the US, MVM 
revenue was in line with management 
expectations, with continued good 
progress in Europe, South-East Asia, 
and Australia offsetting slightly 
weaker performance in China, resulting 
from a change in management post 
the end of the earn-out period.
In the MPO segment, reported revenue 
fell by 2.3% compared to 2016 and was 
down by 7.7% on a like-for-like, 
constant currency basis. Performance 
from the MPO segment was impacted 
by the significant decline in revenue 
from the US MPO segment. Revenue 
from the MPO segment outside of the 
US grew by 6.4%, with revenues from 
MPO Effectiveness services outside of 
the UK representing 10% of total 
revenue. The year saw a scaling up of 
our MPO Effectiveness services in 
Continental Europe and our MPO 
practice in APAC. The UK MPO 
business continued to deliver double-
digit revenue growth of 17.1%, while 
revenue from our MPO team in Spain 
(acquired as part of Media Value in 
February 2016) declined in 2017, 
reflecting high staff turnover during 
the year.
Revenue from the MI segment declined 
by 0.9%, and declined by 3.1% on a 
like-for-like constant currency basis. 
Revenue from the Advertising 
Intelligence business grew by 0.1% on a 
like-for-like constant currency basis, with 
a slightly weaker second half. Revenues 
from our project based Reputation 
business declined as expected from 
£2.0 million in 2016 to £1.2 million in 
2017. In March 2018, we entered into an 
agreement to sell the trade and assets 
of our Reputation business to Echo 
Research Holdings Limited. Completion 
will take place on 31 March 2018. 
Underlying operating profit was 
£12.0 million. This represents a drop in 
operating margin from 2016 of 1.7pp 
to 13.8%. This reflects lower 
profitability from the US MPO 
business, combined with planned 
investment in our Growth Acceleration 
Plan – notably in investing in MPO 
Effectiveness resources in new 
markets. Investment in the Growth 
Acceleration Plan was scaled back 
during 2017 and cost control 
measures  were implemented in the 
US MPO business during 2017, but 
these were not sufficient to offset 
the revenue decline.
Margins in the MVM segment were 
consistent with 2016, as strong 
performance from our Contract 
Compliance business offset lower 
profitability from our US Media 
benchmarking business. Margins in the 
MPO segment declined sharply in 2017, 
reflecting the revenue decline in the 
US MPO business, together with the 
investment in the expansion of the 
MPO segment in Europe and APAC. 
Central costs, which are not allocated 
to a segment, were in line with the 
prior year.
Underlying profit before tax was 
£11.0 million. Statutory operating 
profit was £5.5 million, down from 
£7.8 million in 2016, and statutory 
profit before tax decreased to 
£4.5 million, from £6.6 million in 2016. 
The lower statutory operating profit 
and profit before tax reflect both 
lower underlying profitability as well 
as an increase highlighted items. 
Highlighted items are detailed in the 
CFO’s report.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Our service offerings.
In the last quarter of 2016, we defined 
the core purpose of Ebiquity to be 
‘creating clarity for our clients’. 
The consequence of the clarity that 
we create for marketers – through 
independent, impartial advice, 
delivered by the most knowledgeable 
and experienced consultants in the 
industry – is better informed 
marketing investment decision-
making. Through our different service 
offerings, we empower our clients to 
focus on the metrics that matter for 
their businesses. We then show them 
how to use these to judge what’s 
working well for them, what’s not, 
and how they should adjust their 
media and marketing investment 
plans accordingly.
‘Creating clarity’ is the North Star 
which guides everything we do. This 
includes how we advise and guide our 
clients, and is the foundation that 
underpins our long-term strategic 
ambition to become the leading 
media and marketing analytics 
consultancy, globally.
For the past few years, we have gone 
to market with three, core practice 
areas: Media Value Measurement, 
Marketing Performance Optimisation, 
and Market Intelligence.
 
Media Value 
Measurement (‘MVM’)
Ebiquity is the global market leader in 
media performance benchmarking, 
media agency management, and 
contract compliance.
We enable our clients to increase 
media efficiency and transparency 
through media performance reviews, 
benchmarking, and measurement.
Dietmar Kruse 
Practice Principal,  
Media Performance
“ Advertisers face many challenges in 
media today. Transparency, 
programmatic, and meaningful 
metrics for walled-garden 
platforms like Google and Facebook 
– to name but three. By defining 
digital media benchmarks, we help 
our clients to create clarity.”
And we enable them to make the 
right, long-term decisions – including 
finding and working with the right 
agency partners.
Laetitia Zinetti 
Practice Principal, Media 
Consulting
“ Good relationships between brands 
and their agencies need constant 
vigilance. With the right support 
and a thought-through, end-to-end 
process, brands can ensure their 
agency relationships – both 
well-established and new – deliver 
for the long-term future.”
We also assess agencies’ compliance 
with contractual terms via our specialist 
contract compliance business, 
FirmDecisions. In 2017, FirmDecisions 
undertook more than 300 contract 
compliance audits covering activity 
in 70 markets. 40 of the world’s 
leading 100 advertisers consulted 
with FirmDecisions over the course 
of the year.
Stephen Broderick 
Global CEO of FirmDecisions
“ It is only through well-written, 
regularly-updated contracts that 
marketers can secure the level of 
transparency they desire. With the 
industry changing so fast, brands 
need to review and update their 
contracts regularly to stay ahead 
of the game.”

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Marketing 
Performance 
Optimisation (‘MPO’)
We guide clients to decide how much 
they need to spend on marketing, 
where to allocate, and how to optimise 
their marketing investments. We help 
them choose which analytics 
technologies to select, and how to 
improve digital customer journeys. 
Our work in this practice has two 
distinct service offerings: econometric 
modelling and customer experience 
analytics.
Mike Campbell 
Head of International Effectiveness
“ Marketers are rewarded by the 
C-suite for delivering real and 
tangible ROI. And it’s only by 
understanding the relative and 
absolute contribution of all channels 
and platforms – taking and 
attributing the Total View, online 
and offline – that they can 
accomplish this.”
Tim Hussain 
Practice Principal,  
Tech – Europe
“ There are so many options for 
marketing technology that many 
marketers don’t know where 
to turn for simple, clear, and 
impartial advice. By building 
a team from right across the 
industry – and by remaining 
staunchly independent – we are 
helping our clients make informed 
advertising technology decisions.”
Market Intelligence 
(‘MI’) 
For almost 20 years, we have provided 
clients with a clear picture of their own 
and their competitors’ in-market 
creative executions, ad spend, and 
media strategies. Our market-leading 
family of Ebiquity Portfolio media 
platforms was joined in 2017 by 
Ebiquity Portfolio Digital, providing 
comprehensive coverage of creative 
and spend data for digital advertising 
content. This is supported by specialist 
insight, market, and earned media 
research experts who combine 
automated analytics with native-
language human analysis. The sale 
process of the AdIntel business 
required significant time investment by 
our senior management over the 
course of 2017.
Morag Blazey 
Managing Principal, Intel
“ With the sale of the Advertising 
Intelligence business, the 
combined entity will be a strong 
global player, with the scale and 
strategic focus to continue the 
level of investment needed to keep 
the business evolving and deliver 
better long-term career growth.”

Changing structure, changing reporting 
As the media industry is changing rapidly, 
so Ebiquity is transforming and developing 
to meet the needs of the world’s 
marketers and brand custodians.
Continued transformational change in 2017
14 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 From 2018 onwards, we will also, 
therefore, move from segmental 
reporting as MPO, MVM, and MI, to 
reporting by 1) Media, 2) Analytics and 
Tech, and until such time as the sale of 
the Advertising Intelligence business is 
completed, 3) Intel.
Michael Karg, PhD
Group Chief Executive Officer
Christian Polman 
Chief Strategy Officer
“ By creating a three-practice 
business that addresses our clients’ 
needs in Media, Analytics, and Tech, 
we’ve made our market offering 
both more relevant and more 
buyable. We’ve shown our clients 
that we understand the challenges 
they face in the ever-more complex 
media and marketing ecosystem.”
As the media industry is changing 
rapidly, so Ebiquity is transforming 
and developing to meet the needs of 
the world’s marketers and brand 
custodians. When I joined Ebiquity 
as Group CEO in 2016, we launched 
a Growth Acceleration Plan designed 
to achieve a compound annual growth 
rate of 10% by 2021. This strategy 
is designed to make our business 
the best-equipped partner to help 
our clients to build accountability 
into their marketing investments.
The sale of our Advertising Intelligence 
business is clear evidence of our 
transformation in action. Creating 
a more operationally-aligned, 
streamlined business will allow us to 
respond better to our clients’ needs 
and focus on our Growth Acceleration 
Plan moving forward.
Accordingly, we have now restructured 
our business into three core service 
offerings. This restructure better 
reflects both advertisers’ needs 
and the reality of the media and 
marketing ecosystem today and 
for the years to come.
Operating under an agile, One Ebiquity consulting model, we have now structured ourselves as:
Ebiquity  
Media
covering services such as media 
performance benchmarking, media 
agency management, and contract 
compliance
Ebiquity 
Analytics 
incorporates areas such as 
marketing effectiveness, market 
mix modelling, total view 
attribution, and data-driven 
customer experience optimisation
Ebiquity  
Tech
comprising services such as 
strategy, vendor selection, and 
implementation for ad tech, 
martech, and data management
