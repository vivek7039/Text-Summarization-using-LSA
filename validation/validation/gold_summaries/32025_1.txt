 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
How does Brexit impact NWF?
We are a UK business, with three divisions which 
all performed well in the global financial crisis as 
they supply basic products to meet the country’s 
needs for Feeds, Food and Fuels. We have not 
seen any changes in the demand for our products 
and services to date and monitor the situation closely.
Who are your largest shareholders?
We have no shareholders greater than 5% but a 
number of significant pension funds and investment 
funds below 5% with whom we meet regularly.
Which is your favoured division?
All three businesses are unique and deliver benefits 
to shareholders and have development potential. 
In addition, through operating in three separate 
markets the overall risk profile of the Group is reduced.
Does the pension scheme constrain the 
development potential of the Group?
Our pension scheme is closed to both new 
members and future accrual and is carefully 
monitored by the Board and managed carefully 
alongside professional advice. We have a strong 
asset base and significant banking facilities to help 
invest in growth opportunities.
Are you just a dividend/yield stock?
Whilst we recognise the value in the dividend, 
we are looking to deliver total shareholder return 
through a combination of share price accretion and 
a progressive dividend policy. We are looking to be 
strong and resilient but are also ambitious for the 
development of NWF. 
Is the Group susceptible to weather and 
commodity price changes?
Commodities can impact the Group in our 
Feeds business as we buy forward in line with the 
market and have a capability to outperform when 
conditions move in our favour. With an oil business 
that focuses on heating oil in the winter, cold 
weather will benefit the division, but an ability 
to sell a range of oil products has demonstrated 
some effective mitigation in recent milder conditions.
Q&A
with Chief Executive Officer, Richard Whiting
NWF delivered a solid performance 
last year with increased activity in 
all three divisions and the benefits 
of the diversified business model 
resulted in record earnings 
per share.
STRATEGIC REPORT NWF delivered a solid performance last year with 
increased activity in all three divisions and the 
benefits of the diversified business model resulting 
in record earnings per share. The increase in 
profitability and strong cash generation allowed 
the Group to continue its investment strategy, 
completing major feed mill expansions in the year. 
The Group delivered headline operating profit 
up 3.4% to £9.0 million (2016: £8.7 million) and 
headline profit before tax up 2.4% to £8.5 million 
(2016: £8.3 million). Headline earnings per share 
were up 3.7% to a record level of 14.0p 
(2016: 13.5p).
Cash management remains strong with net debt of 
£13.0 million, representing 1.0x EBITDA. This has 
been achieved by generating net cash of £2.1 million 
after interest, tax, dividends and net replacement 
and maintenance capital expenditure of £4.0 million, 
but before development spend of £5.2 million, 
as a consequence of the trading performance and 
further sustainable working capital improvements.
Outlook
In Feeds, margins and volumes are in line with our 
expectations for this time of the year. Our mills in 
the North, Cheshire and the South West are fully 
operational and aligned to the needs of our farming 
customers in these key areas of the country.
In Food, we are focused on business development 
activity to maintain utilisation levels at the Wardle 
site and have won some small new accounts to 
date. The Palletline operation continues to expand 
and we are looking at further options to increase 
this segment of our business. We remain focused 
on continuing to provide excellent levels of service 
and value to our customers and supermarkets 
across the UK.
In Fuels, we have a proven depot operating model 
and have demonstrated that the business can 
deliver a solid result even when market conditions 
are adverse. Volumes remain robust for the time 
of year.
The Group has established a solid platform for 
development, has strong cash flows and flexible 
banking facilities to fund growth and has a 
strong asset base that provides resilience. 
We will therefore continue to review acquisition 
opportunities, building on our successful track 
record of acquiring and integrating businesses.
Performance to date in the current financial year 
has been in line with the Board’s expectations. We 
expect to benefit from a full year of efficiencies at 
our new expanded Feeds operational base. 
Overall, the Board therefore remains confident 
about the Group’s future prospects.
