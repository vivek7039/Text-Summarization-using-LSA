 06 ZPG Plc Annual Report 2017
Dear Shareholders
We have expanded considerably over 
the past 12 months as a result of strong 
underlying growth and the announcement 
of five new acquisitions and two new 
strategic partnerships.
We saw strong performance in our Property 
division, driven by a continuation of returning 
portal partners, strong demand for our 
upsell products and further migration of our 
software partners to cloud-based products. 
Our Comparison division also traded well, 
reaching a new milestone of over 1 million 
energy switches in a 12 month period and 
saving consumers over £400 million off 
their household bills over that period.
Financial performance
Total revenue increased by 24% to 
£244.5 million driven by a strong underlying 
performance across both divisions together 
with the inclusion of acquisitions during 
the Period. 
Statutory profit for the year was up 2% to 
£37.4 million after the impact of increased 
exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible 
assets arising from acquisitions and 
share-based payments. Statutory basic 
EPS marginally decreased at 8.8 pence 
as a result of a 5% equity placing of ZPG’s 
ordinary issued share capital in January to 
help fund strategic acquisitions.
The past year has been another 
transformative one for ZPG and, on behalf 
of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
Company’s results for the year ended 
30 September 2017.
Another 
transformative year 
for ZPG

Strategic report
The Board uses a combination of both 
statutory and adjusted performance measures 
when reviewing the performance of the 
business. The adjusted performance measures, 
including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted 
basic EPS, provide additional information 
in line with how financial performance is 
measured by Management and reported 
to the Board. Both of these measures are 
also used in determining the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors and Management 
and are used by the Company’s external debt 
providers to assess performance against 
covenants and determine the interest charge. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 25% to 
£96.4 million (2016: £77. 1 million), and 
adjusted EPS increased by 20% to 
15.2 pence (2016: 12. 7 pence).
During the year we increased our overall 
credit facilities by £125 million including 
updated leverage covenants in order to help 
fund our acquisitions. ZPG remains highly 
cash generative and as at 30 September 2017 
the Company’s net debt position was 
£191.5 million (2016: £146.3 million ).
Acquisitions
We continued our strong track record 
of successful M&A activity to help deliver 
our mission:
• In November 2016, we acquired 
TechnicWeb, one of the UK’s leading 
estate agency website design and 
hosting businesses.
• In January 2017, we acquired Hometrack, 
the UK’s leading provider of residential 
property market insights and analytics.
• In March 2017, we acquired ExpertAgent, 
one of the UK’s leading cloud-based estate 
agent software solutions.
• In September 2017, we acquired 
Ravensworth, the UK’s leading provider of 
on-demand print and creative marketing 
services to UK estate and letting agents. 
• On 1 O ctober 2017, following the end 
of the Period, we acquired Money, one 
of the UK’s leading financial services 
comparison websites. 
These acquisitions are all part of the 
Company’s continuing mission to be the 
platform of choice for consumers and partners 
engaged in property and household decisions. 
They also further increase the number of 
partners that we work with and enhance the 
Company’s comprehensive product offering 
for both our consumers and partners.
Dividend
The Company’s dividend policy is to pay 
between 35% and 45% of profit after tax 
in dividends to shareholders. In line with 
our dividend policy, the Board has proposed 
a final dividend of 3.8 pence per share to 
be paid in respect of the year ended 
30 September 2017.
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting (AGM), this will be 
paid on 8 February 2018 to all shareholders 
on the share register as at 8 December 2017. 
An interim dividend of 1.9 pence per share 
(2016: 1.5 pence per share) was paid in 
June 2017 . Therefore, the total dividend for 
the year ended 30 September 2017 will be 
5.7 pence per share (2016: 5.2 pence per share), 
which represents a 40.4% pay-out ratio.
Governance
There is an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge 
of ZPG within the Board. This means that 
the Board is able to discharge its duties 
and responsibilities effectively and can 
direct and lead the strategic direction 
of the Company. The Board is committed 
to compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and full details of the 
work of the Board and its Committees 
during the year are set out in the Corporate 
Governance Report.
Board update
During the year, the Board reassessed 
Grenville Turner’s independence and it was 
agreed that since Grenville stepped down 
as the Chairman of Countrywide Plc, a 
customer and previously a major shareholder 
in ZPG, in April 2016 and sinc e Countrywide 
ceased to be a shareholder of the Company 
from September 2016 onwards, Grenville would 
be considered independent for the purposes 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
from the conclusion of the Board meeting 
in July 2017 onwards. Further details of 
the Board’s determination of Grenville’s 
independence are set out on page 52. 
Therefore, at least half of the Board now 
comprises Non-Executive Directors 
determined by the Board to be independent. 
Biographies of all members of the Board 
appear on pages 50 and 51.
In January 2017, Stephen Daintith stepped 
down as a Non-Executive Director nominated 
by DMGT pursuant to its relationship 
agreement with the Company, entered into 
at the time of the Company’s initial public 
offering. James Welsh was nominated by 
DMGT to replace Stephen. James acts as 
an observer on the Audit Committee and 
the Remuneration Committee. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank Stephen 
for his hard work and significant contributions 
to the Company and welcome James to 
the Board.
Capital structure
In February 2017, 20,897,684 new Ordinary 
shares in the Company were placed at a 
price of 365 pence per share to help fund 
M&A activity. The placing was heavily 
oversubscribed and has helped to increase 
the breadth of our institutional ownership. 
The Company currently holds 135,317 shares 
in treasury.
DMGZ Limited remains the largest single 
shareholder in the Company with a holding 
of 29 .8%. Alex Chesterman, Founder & Chief 
Executive Officer, holds 0.97%. The number 
of shares held by institutional shareholders 
has increased from 64.3% to 68.8% over 
the past 1 2 months. The Company continues 
to build up a register of respected 
institutional shareholders.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s next AGM will be held on 
30 January 2018. The resolutions at the AGM 
will be conducted on a poll, as we believe 
that this method is the most inclusive, enabling 
the views of the widest number of shareholders 
to be taken into consideration. The AGM is 
a great opportunity to meet the Board and I 
would like to encourage our shareholders to 
attend. I will be at the AGM, along with the 
other members of the Board, and look 
forward to seeing some of you there.
It has been an exceptionally busy and 
exciting year for us. Looking ahead, we will 
continue to focus on the execution of our 
key strategies and to drive shareholder value. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
everyone in the Company for their contribution 
and commitment over this past year.
