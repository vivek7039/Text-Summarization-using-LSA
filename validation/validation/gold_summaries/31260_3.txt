Recent Performance
The Group has increased its underlying profit for the year, which 
is a very encouraging result. However, it is disappointing to 
report that the strong growth in both revenue and profitability 
has been significantly impacted upon by the ongoing legacy 
contractual dispute with Cyden Homes Limited and the poor 
second half trading performance of the Utilities division. 
 
Group revenue increased by 16.48% to £291.77 million 
(2016: £250.49 million) with operating profit decreasing by 
46.88% to £1.19 million (2016: £2.24 million). Excluding 
the deleterious effect of the legacy contract normal trading 
profitability improved by 40.44% to £8.30 million (2016: £5.91 
million). Earnings per share declined by 71.80% to 7.31p (2016: 
25.95p).

undertaken. Robust and effective governance is more essential 
than ever. Procedures and controls continue to be reviewed on 
a regular basis to ensure the protection of shareholder interests.
Our People
Our people are the cornerstone of the Group, particularly in 
an organisation that still undertakes a significant proportion 
of its workload utilising its own resources. In an increasingly 
competitive market, the attraction, development and retention 
of the calibre of resource, with the appropriate skills required 
to satisfy the growth potential of the Group, is of paramount 
importance.
We are intent on maintaining the development of a sustainable, 
ethical business that cares for its individuals, the environment 
and the communities where it both impacts on and draws 
its resources from. Investment in leadership, skill-based 
and professional qualification attainment training has been 
maintained to allow each individual to contribute to their full 
potential. Testament to this is the number of training days 
completed increasing by 23.7% over the previous year.
To achieve our strategic targets the creation of a more diverse 
workforce is essential and in the construction industry in 
general gender disparity still continues. This is the first year that 
a Gender Pay Gap report has been published and it reflects 
the lower proportion of women in senior roles within the Group. 
This, coupled with only an 11% total female representation 
within the Group is outdated. A more progressive and 
embracing approach is now being adopted to secure the 
injection of female talent that is required to take the Group 
forward and provide a different perspective to the business.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the 
employees for their hard work and commitment during this 
last year as the business is entirely dependent upon their 
contribution.
Health and Safety
The well-being of all the Group’s employees is of paramount 
concern to your Board. The cycle of improved performance 
has been maintained with the “Accident Frequency Rate” (AFR) 
reducing to a highly creditable 0.04 (2016: 0.11). The culture is 
now well embedded with the emphasis moving from “Safe to 
Safer”.
Opportunity for Growth
The Group has promising opportunities for growth in all its 
chosen markets and as the key customer relationships continue 
to mature, projects of a higher value are becoming available. 
The AMP7 retendering cycle by certain water companies 
equally offers a further opportunity for future expansion within 
the water industry. The Group is currently engaged in several 
joint ventures, which currently are all delivering positively. The 
Elan Valley Aqueduct, in particular, already being the recipient of 
several awards.
Outlook
The secured order book for completion in the current year is 
£299 million (2017: £225 million) and the Group is forecasting 
further sustainable growth this current year based upon this 
and further opportunities in the pipeline.
