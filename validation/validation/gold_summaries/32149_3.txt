 Chairman’s  
statement
Sir John Parker 
Chairman
 Pennon Group performed 
well in the year, delivering on 
its strategy of market-leading 
performance across its 
businesses. 
Dear Shareholder
Pennon Group performed well in the year, delivering 
on its strategy of market-leading performance, 
efficiency and investing for growth. The Group has the 
UK’s top two water businesses as measured by return 
on regulated equity (RoRE) while Viridor’s expanding 
portfolio of Energy Recovery Facilities (ERFs) is on 
track to generate further growth in earnings over the 
next few years. The Group’s Shared Services Review 
addressed a key strategic objective to drive value 
through increased efficiency during the year.
The Group’s final dividend of 24.87 pence per 
share reflects an increase of 7.1% and maintains 
our long-standing sector-leading dividend policy 
of RPI plus 4% year-on-year growth. This should 
see dividends per share almost doubling over 
10 years to 2020. 
Pennon is committed to 
providing a safe place for our 
people to work, where health 
and wellbeing comes first.
Since my previous report we have continued to make 
good progress in establishing an effective Group 
structure by drawing together all aspects of the 
Group under the Pennon umbrella. Our CEO, with the 
support of a high-calibre executive team, is pulling 
together support functions at Group level that were 
previously held within each subsidiary. The two 
Managing Directors who are running the water and 
waste businesses as operational divisions report 
directly to the CEO. Pennon’s Non-Executive 
Directors are now also members of the South West 
Water board, along with three dedicated South West 
Water non-executive directors, one of which is 
currently a vacancy.
Safety
The position of health and safety as the first item 
on the agenda for every Board meeting reflects the 
importance I and my colleagues attach to this crucial 
area. It also underlines our determination to increase 
employee engagement, address the culture and 
behaviours that lead to accidents and learn all 
relevant lessons for the future from any incident. 
Regrettably, a tragic incident occurred in August 
2016, resulting in the death of a Viridor employee 
whilst at work. Our thoughts are with his family, 
friends and colleagues as we work with the Health 
and Safety Executive in relation to this incident.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 We strive for the highest standards of health and 
safety to achieve our objective of a harm free 
environment. Pennon is committed to providing a 
safe place for our people to work where health and 
wellbeing comes first. The Board has supported the 
appointment of a Group director of Safety, Health, 
Quality and Sustainability, who will devise and 
implement a strategy to raise the Group’s health 
and safety performance.
Employees and culture 
Throughout the Group, there is a spirit of pride and 
professionalism and these are key qualities at a time 
of change. We have no shortage of new talent joining 
the company too, through graduate recruitment 
and our award-winning apprenticeship programmes. 
We are determined to recognise talent in both the 
Group’s businesses and to support development 
of people from early on in their careers, not just in 
top-level succession planning. 
As many aspects of the Group’s structure are still 
relatively new, we intend to provide more information 
about Pennon’s culture and values in next year’s 
annual report. Our subsidiary companies each have 
a strong sense of purpose supported by their own 
set of corporate values and this provides a sound 
foundation on which to build. I firmly believe that by 
getting the structure and governance of the Group 
right, and by attracting and developing the right 
people, the right culture and values will follow.
We are developing a culture 
that can be lived throughout 
the Group.
Meanwhile, on behalf of the Board, I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank all our employees for their 
professional approach and their dedication to the 
many communities and stakeholders we serve daily. 
Shared services and other 
Group synergies 
Efforts to centralise key corporate services and 
operational functions following the Shared Services 
Review reflecting our more unified Group are 
progressing well. This is part of an efficiency 
programme that is increasing integration, 
encouraging the sharing of best practice and 
creating shareholder value. This work has been 
facilitated by the creation of the role of Group Chief 
Executive Officer, which has now been in existence 
for over a year and is binding the Pennon Group more 
closely together.
Sustainability
As a leading environmental infrastructure company, 
the Group actively contributes to the UK’s long-term 
needs for water, energy and waste management and 
we aim to ensure that all our business activities have 
a positive economic, social and environmental impact. 
Our evaluation of risk consistently addresses 
sustainability requirements. The Board’s Sustainability 
Committee oversaw the Group’s performance during 
the year in maintaining a responsible approach to 
business operations.

clear lines of sight into the subsidiary companies

values that will be shaped by employees during 
the year ahead

Strategic report Governance
The Group’s revised framework for governance and 
decision-making introduced in April 2016 is operating 
well and allowing us to pursue synergies across the 
Group. Further details are provided on pages 58 to 
62. Our Senior Independent Director, Gill Rider, 
completed an assessment during the year of the 
new approach. This was conducted alongside an 
independent external evaluation of the Board’s 
structure, operation and performance. Based 
on these appraisals and on my own experience, 
I believe the Group has a robust governance 
structure that is delivering efficient and transparent 
decision-making while preserving the degree of 
regulatory independence that Ofwat requires for 
the water business. I commend the Group’s 
commitment to the new governance framework.
The Group has a robust 
governance structure that 
is delivering efficient and 
transparent decision-making.
Board changes
Ian McAulay stepped down as the Chief Executive 
Officer of Viridor during the year and we thank him 
for his contribution and wish him well in the future. 
Phil Piddington was appointed to the new role of 
Managing Director of Viridor in September 2016. 
The change in the management team and structure 
at Viridor, which mirrors the arrangements in place 
at South West Water, better reflects the objectives 
of the Group and will drive stronger accountability. 
Moreover, the appointment of Phil Piddington 
demonstrates that the Group is adding new skills 
and executing succession planning well. 
Steve Johnson stepped down as a non-executive 
director of South West Water in April 2016 following 
his appointment to a new external executive position.
Rigorous testing is a 
key part of ensuring 
a high quality water 
supply for customers

Pennon Board 
visits  Ardley ERF
Board members regularly visit operational 
sites and take the opportunity to meet 
employees and see a plant at work. In April 
2016 the Board visited Bournemouth Water’s 
headquarters and received a tour of the water 
treatment works.
The Board meeting in February 2017 was held 
at Ardley ERF and included a tour of the plant 
and its award-winning Visitor Centre which 
received 3,483 visitors this year. 
Board members also met the Ardley-based 
Energy trading team that implements the 
Group’s energy risk management strategy 
and has aligned energy contracts to optimise 
cost and carbon benefits. This same team 
also manages the energy trading for both 
output and usage, which has helped the 
Group achieve greater energy efficiency.
