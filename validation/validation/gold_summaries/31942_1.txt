Chief Executive’s report 
 
Towards the latter part of this breakthrough year, the Group has commenced generating commercial 
revenues from products and services that are well placed to offer unique solutions over a sustained period 
of competitive advantage in the future.   
 
SAWSense 
SAWSense is a leader in the development of Surface Acoustic Wave ("SAW") wireless, battery-less, 
sensor systems that offer significant advantages over legacy systems in common use. The business 
continues to be involved in several live projects in conjunction with major global industrial companies. In 
the short to medium term, the primary source of ongoing revenue is dependent upon the level of customer 
chargeable engineering activity and royalties, which was £0.29m in 2017 (2016: £0.42m). 
In the prior year, pilot production had commenced of sensor kits to measure temperature, vibration and 
torque on a new range of industrial equipment recently launched by a large European OEM. Whilst the 
technology continues to be under commercial evaluation, the customer has yet to determine how the 
benefits it offers are to be monetised.  Accordingly, there can be no certainty of future income from this 
source.  
We continue to develop potential applications in other sectors, most notably automotive, although 
commercialisation in these areas is not considered to be imminent. 
In July 2016, SAWSense entered into a significant licensing agreement with GE for the use of our 
patented, wireless, passive SAW technology in a certain specific torque application. The Group received 
a non-refundable license fee of $0.50m on completion in July 2016, with a further $0.25m received in 
March 2017 following successful technical validation. In addition to the fee, GE will pay to Transense a 
perpetual sales royalty in respect of unit sales upon commercialisation, although this is not likely to arise 
for several years. More recently the Group has been involved in discussions with a number of other 
divisions within GE regarding further projects and the relationship between the Group and GE continues 
to progress well. 
 
Translogik 
iTrack 
Our iTrack products provide a range of features that allow mine operators to track their vehicles’ tyre 
temperature, pressure, speed, braking and location in real-time and receive early warning of potential 
problems, hazards or opportunities. 
In September 2016, we successfully launched the new iTrack II system, a combination of sensor and 
transmission technology which we believe offers unparalleled features and benefits to mine operators 
across the world.  We set out to maximise functionality and connectivity in a single comprehensive system, 
comprising rugged and reliable hardware, connectivity with other technologies, and meaningful real-time 
output. 
The control unit is mounted in each truck, and transmits live data across various protocols to iTrack servers 
at one of three global control centres. Dedicated iTrack experts are on hand to analyse live and historic 
data, determine trends and create custom reports and warnings. Mine operations will have access to tyre 
temperature, pressure, sensor function, GPS and speed data on easy to read, customisable screens. This 
data can provide invaluable signals, not only to avoid tyre failures and increase life, but also to increase 
truck speeds, availability and productivity. Our offer provides the equipment on finance or operating lease 
although our preference will be towards operating leases with additional charges for data provision and 
monitoring.

Chief Executive’s report (continued) 
 
The market response to launch has been very encouraging and we have subsequently generated live 
trials on 14 sites covering 3 continents/territories. Trials have generally been successful, and whilst the 
rate of adoption meets our high expectations, the trial duration and lead times to roll out and revenue 
generation are often extended by understandable bureaucratic and operational delays.  
 
Probe 
During the year, several multinational tyre manufacturers have commenced the implementation of new 
software platforms that have been integrated with the probe and it has become clear that our product is 
the tread depth tool of choice for Bridgestone, Goodyear and Continental, amongst others and as a result 
our probe revenue in the final quarter of the year experienced a marked upturn. 
 
In addition to this we have, since the year end, received our first significant order for our PCAS, from Tiger 
Wheel in South Africa. PCAS is a software system coupled with our tread depth probe which enables a 
tyre fitter to complete a fast, accurate tread depth audit of a passenger car and produce a customer friendly 
report which acts as a visual aid for the garage to sell tyres and additional services such as alignments. 
We are hopeful this initial order will lead to further sales in South Africa and elsewhere.  
 Current trading and outlook 
 
 
Since the beginning of the new financial year on 1 July 2017, revenues have shown a significant increase 
on the run rate of the prior year.   iTrack II was adopted by two Glencore mines in Australia during June 
2017, and in early August 2017, a further Australian mine operated by BHP. These systems are now in 
implementation, and revenues have commenced.  Several other opportunities are at a reasonably 
advanced stage, and we expect further order activity in Australia, Latin America and Southern Africa in 
coming weeks. 
 
Furthermore, as indicated above, order intake for probes has started to build momentum, and has already 
reached a level comparable with nearly 60% of the aggregate order intake for last year. 
 
We continue to engage with GE and others on commercialisation of SAW projects in a variety of 
applications, although we do not anticipate strong growth in revenues in this area in the short term. 
 
Accordingly, we consider that the outlook for the next financial year is satisfactory.
