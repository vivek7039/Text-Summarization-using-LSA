 SCALING UP
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
 “I AM DELIGHTED WITH OUR 
RESULTS AND EXCITED ABOUT 
OUR FUTURE.”
I am pleased to report on a very satisfying 
year in Frontier’s continued development. 
We completed the transition of our 
business to our chosen multi-franchise 
self-publishing model with the successful 
launch of our second franchise, 
Planet Coaster, and we are excited 
about the potential for our third 
franchise, Jurassic World Evolution. 
Meanwhile, Elite Dangerous continues 
to grow its addressable audience and 
is performing well.
Our long-term ambition is to become a 
global leader in entertainment and we are 
scaling up to continue our multi-franchise 
success story. Our recent strong self-publishing 
performance, as well as our long history of 
delivery and capability, positions us very 
well to achieve this. We have established a 
scale-up plan to achieve our next step which 
includes investments in people, organisation, 
geographical distribution and facilities. To 
support these plans we took a strategic 
investment from Tencent in July 2017, 
raising £17.7 million. This will enable us to 
further deepen the success of our franchises, 
reach new audiences, enrich the audience 
experience and continue to grow their number.
We continue to develop our organisation 
to fulfi l our goals. In particular, we are 
focusing on our management teams and 
our infrastructure. As noted in last year’s 
report, Jonathan Milner stepped down 
from the Board as a Non-Executive Director 
in July 2016 and Charles Cotton joined in 
his place. I would like to again express my 
thanks to Jonathan, who was a great 
help during our transition. Charles has 
a successful worldwide track record in 
high-growth technology companies and has 
been a valuable source of advice and wisdom 
since he joined the Board. In April 2017 we 
further strengthened the Board with the 
appointment of Alex Bevis as CFO and 
Company Secretary. Alex brings extensive 
board experience as VP Finance and CFO 
of high technology growth companies from 
his work at CSR plc and Xaar plc. 
I am delighted with our results and excited 
about our future. On behalf of the Board, 
I take this opportunity to thank our people 
for their dedication, engagement, skill and 
professionalism that has produced such 
pleasing progress for the Company.
