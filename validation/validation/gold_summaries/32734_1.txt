CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
The results set out within this report show continued growth of the business during the year ended 30 April 2017.  
The year has seen the integration of new business into Guernsey, Geneva and Mauritius together with expansion into the 
UK and Middle East.
Group Activity
This year has seen considerable change within the Group 
culminating in raising external capital and listing on The 
International Stock Exchange in April 2017. As anticipated, 
the listing has delivered many benefits for the Group.
We have made considerable progress integrating our 
previous acquisitions whilst maintaining strong organic 
growth.
We have restructured the governance regime and we were 
delighted to appoint two experienced non executives, 
Andrew Haining as Non-Executive Chairman and Iain Stokes 
as Non-Executive director and Chair of the Audit Committee. 
The executive directors who previously sat on the Group 
Board now sit on the Management Committee.
Andrew has a wealth of experience in mergers and 
acquisitions over a 30 year career in banking and private 
equity. Iain was previously Group Managing Director at 
Mourant International Fund Administration (‘MIFA’) where 
he was part of the executive team that managed the sale of 
MIFA to State Street.
Performance
The year ending 30 April 2017 saw Group revenues grow 
to £35.1m. This represents a 26% uplift against 2016. It has 
been achieved through a combination of acquired revenues 
and continued organic growth.
The core business has grown strongly with a compound 
annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17% over the last five years 
and 19% during 2017.
Unadjusted EBITDA (£8.3m) grew by 29% during the year as 
our smaller, more recently established businesses matured 
and the integration of acquired business was completed. 
The Group has fully expensed significant amounts of short 
term and one off costs associated with its listing and its 
recent acquisitions. As the Group continues to evolve we 
expect to reap the benefits of this investment.
Our Trust and Corporate Division remains the largest 
segment of our business and it performed well last year with 
revenues rising to £22.3m.
The Funds Division has another strong year with a 28% 
growth in revenue. Our IFM AIFM business grew particularly 
strongly.
The Pensions Division continues to build critical mass 
and despite a very competitive environment, is delivering 
growth for the Group.
Within Ancillary Services, our Treasury and our Asset Finance 
businesses performed very strongly. During the year, we 
made the strategic decision to dispose of our interest in 
United Ventures and this process was completed well before 
the year end.
Staff
Our staff are fundamental to our success. The Group 
employs more than 300 people across 9 jurisdictions. The 
vast majority of colleagues are client facing and spend 
their time dedicated to delivering service excellence to our 
widely varied clients.
We actively encourage our colleagues to undertake 
professional qualification and engage in continuing 
professional development. More than 68% of staff are either 
qualified or studying for a professional qualification. We 
believe this ethos delivers a high level of professionalism 
across the Group that is at the core of our culture and 
business approach.
We want our employees to benefit from their collective 
efforts and the Group’s success. Over 53% of staff members 
have an equity interest in the Group. Since the year end we 
introduced a buy-as-you-earn share scheme to extend this 
further, with 27% of our staff choosing to participate in the 
scheme.
New Business
The revenues of our core businesses grew strongly last year, 
continuing a long term trend of growth.
As the Group grows, we continue to refine our approach 
and the new business pipeline remains good across all three 
Divisions. 5 www.praxisifm.com

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT (continued)
Projects
During the year a new version of the core administration 
platform was installed, with Jersey migrating across from 
their legacy system.
Exposure to cyber threats and the potential impact is 
greater in Financial Services than in other businesses. We 
have invested considerable time and resources in order to 
protect our businesses. Additionally we have invested in 
training and system monitoring to limit the impact caused 
by any potential interruption.
Integration of Acquisitions
During the prior year, the Group acquired 100% of the 
equity in Ampersand Management which had offices in 
Geneva and Mauritius. This acquisition, together with that 
of Balmor Management, has had a very beneficial impact on 
the performance of our Geneva operations and the teams 
are fully integrated into the existing PraxisIFM business.
The Group has successfully integrated the Confiance 
team and clients into our Guernsey Trust operation and 
the combined business is performing above our initial 
expectations at the time of acquisition.
The UK Fund Administration business acquired in 2015 has 
been fully integrated into our Fund Administration Division.
Acquisitions and New Ventures
During this Financial Year the Group made two further 
acquisitions and opened one new operation.
Cavendish Corporate Investments is a Guernsey company 
specialising in the business of writing pensions and annuities 
on human life and bespoke annuities.
Ryland Gray is based in the United Arab Emirates and 
specialises in the administration of End of Service Benefit 
Schemes. 
The Group was delighted to obtain the first license for Trust 
Administration in Abu Dhabi Global Markets. Subsequent to 
the year end the Group also obtained the first license for 
Fund Administration in Abu Dhabi Global Markets.
Summary
We have had a busy 12 months and I would like to take the 
opportunity to thank everyone who has helped the Group 
to date.
