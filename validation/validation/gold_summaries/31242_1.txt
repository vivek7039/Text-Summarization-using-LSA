Statement from 
the CIO of the 
Investment 
Manager
Gary Channon
April 2018
If 2016 was a year for sowing, as we did in a substantial way after the Brexit vote, 
then 2017 was a year of reaping. The alchemy that produced the strong performance 
for the year was an attractively priced portfolio of businesses delivering strong 
fundamental returns in their underlying businesses. Each of our 3 housebuilders 
was up around 50%, as was our new addition in 2016, easyJet. Most of the portfolio 
performed strongly.
Rising prices and good news make it harder to find bargains and so the year ended 
without us having made any new investments. The cash position increased to 5.2% 
at year-end.
Phoenix acting through all its accounts acquired a controlling position in Hornby 
plc during the year, that triggered a mandatory bid and we followed that up with a 
capital raise. At the end of those steps Phoenix, through all the accounts and funds 
it manages has an aggregate interest in 75% of the company. The Aurora Investment 
Trust for its part owns 14%.
We took this unusual move to enable the Company to adopt a strategy that we 
think will lead to a successful revival of the core business. What we have given up in 
terms of liquidity will be gained in the value we believe comes from having some say 
in the levers of value creation within a company. Some of these are protective; we can 
prevent things that in the past have subtracted value, like overpriced acquisitions, poor 
capital allocation and a lack of frugality. On the positive side, it allows us to choose 
who should manage the business and we did that. Lyndon Davies joined Hornby 
in October 2017 as CEO, with an agreement to buy the business he founded and 
built, Oxford Diecast. Lyndon has a great track record as a successful entrepreneur 
who competed with Hornby. He has a keen awareness of the Hornby’s strengths, 
weaknesses and potential; we couldn’t be happier to have him on board.
Hornby is an example of us using all the means at our disposal to make attractive 
investments for our clients whilst protecting the downside risk. In the past this has 
taken many forms, not just purchasing equity, and we expect to continue to approach 
investments that way in the future. Post the year-end and ahead of the publication 
of this report, Phoenix announced a deal to make an investment in Stanley Gibbons, 
which, if it completes, we will tell you about in next year’s report. In structuring 
that transaction we have sacrificed convention and appearances for downside risk 
protection and ultimate returns.
As the UK heads towards Brexit we may see more turbulence in markets and 
from our perspective, we welcome that because it is in those conditions that short-
term valuations on the stock market are most likely to get out of kilter with long-term 
intrinsic values (i.e. what they are likely to be really worth to a long-term investor). 
However, even in strong markets, individual businesses come unstuck and have big 
share price falls. Occasionally one of those will be in our candidate universe and we 
will get an opportunity to act. This has happened in early 2018 with Dignity plc.
A long-term focus on the future, an almost obsessional focus on the competitive 
dynamics of business, observed first hand in the field and a willingness to be patient 
for long periods of time, (acting only occasionally, when values merit it) will, we 
believe, continue to deliver attractive long-term returns for our investors. Over 20 years 
we have developed a disciplined approach to investment using a system and process 
that continues to learn from its shortcomings. This reduces our error rate, limits losses 
when errors are spotted and ultimately builds a portfolio that we understand the value 
of, with a good measure of confidence. Today’s portfolio is priced at almost half of the 
intrinsic value we estimate it contains and although that is not a guide over the short-
term, (which we characterise as less than 3 years), it has, historically, been the best 
guide for our long-term expectations. Strategic Report

Proposed change of investment policy
At this year’s AGM we will be asking shareholders to vote on proposed amendments 
to Aurora’s Existing Investment Policy. The major changes are mentioned in the 
Chairman’s Statement and outlined in more detail on page 9.
A few years ago, shortly before his death, I had the very good fortune to meet with 
Peter Cundill, a highly successful Canadian investor once named by Warren Buffett as 
a potential successor. Amongst many other things Peter told me that given the level 
of knowledge and expertise we had about our companies we were unnecessarily 
restricting ourselves by only investing in the listed equity. His view, which I have come 
to share, was that having gained a good understanding of a company’s value we 
should look for the best risk adjusted way of making our investment, anywhere in the 
capital structure. We have been approaching things in that way since.
We would have sought to alter the Existing Investment Policy at some point, the 
catalyst for doing so now is the recent investment by other Phoenix Funds in Stanley 
Gibbons, the world’s leading stamp and coin dealing business. The two substantial 
changes are to allow investment in unlisted companies and in companies listed in 
countries other than the UK (limited to 10% and 20% at cost prices, respectively). 
Our investment in Stanley Gibbons takes an unusual form, structured to protect 
our downside risk and making it a far superior investment to buying only the listed 
equity. Our overall investment in Stanley Gibbons comprised the purchase of four 
assets: 58% of the equity (listed shares), the bank loan, a portfolio of stamps and a 
receivable from the administration of a Guernsey entity. We hope to be able to allocate 
Aurora its share of the Stanley Gibbons investment and we need to change the 
Existing Investment Policy to do so.
We have invested in Stanley Gibbons and Hornby because they fit our profile of 
having great long term potential to make attractive returns for shareholders whilst 
being currently available at attractive prices.
These changes do not herald any change in our investment philosophy or principles 
which have served us well at Phoenix for the past 20 years.
