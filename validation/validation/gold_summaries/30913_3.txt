 We are in the midst of a necessarily 
ambitious transition: from a diversified 
company, back to its core; to a customer-
focused provider of value-added services 
and solutions; to a digital partner, providing 
data-led insights into the whole energy 
experience of our customers; to an offering 
that provides products, expertise and 
guidance, not simply molecules and 
electrons; to a business model in which we 
can control our own destiny to a far greater 
degree than in the past.
This would be a tough undertaking even in a 
benign and supportive political environment. 
As it is, the pressures we have faced from 
this quarter in our important home market 
have raised the degree of competitive 
difficulty and created an air of uncertainty 
that weighed heavily on our share price 
in 2017 . I am disappointed that the many 
actions we have taken to help vulnerable 
customers, bring old tariff models to an 
end and reward loyalty have received little 
recognition from politicians. 
Our response has been to strive to make 
Centrica more resilient to our external 
environment. This requires a fundamental 
repositioning of our organisation, processes 
and systems, integrating a hitherto 
fragmented structure, always in the service 
of our customers. This must all necessarily 
be executed at pace, because to stand 
still in our fast-moving sector is to invite 
obsolescence, and because our employees 
understandably want to get to the other side 
as quickly as possible. There is a palpable 
desire within Centrica to find new ways of 
accelerating cultural change, building 
innovative capabilities and better meeting 
our customers’ expectations at a lower cost.
Accordingly, the business is being rebuilt 
on a firm foundation. Underlying everything, 
and essential to long-term value creation, 
has been the considerable work done by 
Iain Conn and his senior leadership team in 
focusing on our core businesses of energy 
supply and services, and the propositions 
which our customers expect today and 
desire tomorrow. 
All the while ensuring that the fundamentals 
of change – our purpose, our new values and 
new ethical standards – are fresh, relevant 
and deep rooted, with safety, compliance 
and conduct at the top of our agenda.
The strategic transition is being delivered well 
and all of our declared financial targets have 
been met. But there have also been areas of 
weakness, particularly in our North American 
power book during the second half of the 
year. The impact of competitive and pricing 
pressures here was exacerbated by a 
seasonally weak performance from our 
North American gas business and the 
discovery of an historical accounting issue. 
Our control systems are being enhanced 
and improved and the accounting issue 
was verified as having been a one-off. 
But not before deep damage had been 
done to confidence in the Company and 
its prospects, with commensurate harm to 
our share price layered on top of the impacts 
of the current political uncertainty. There 
was an understandably strong reaction 
from investors and doubts emerged 
about the detail and deliverability of the 
Centrica strategy.
I hope that our Executive team went a long 
way to addressing these concerns at the 
Preliminary Results in February. They 
reminded our stakeholders that the first 
phase of our strategic repositioning has been 
successfully completed. They reinforced the 
point that our Consumer division remains 
stable and profitable, with the prospect of 
real growth, and that there is further scope 
for cost efficiency gains. 
They offered explanations, not excuses, 
for the performance issues in our Business 
division. Above all, they sought to reassure 
investors that, through our changing 
portfolio, cost efficiency and divestment 
options, Centrica has a strengthening 
resilience to uncertainty.
As ever, we recognise that the good 
governance of the Company is essential to 
the delivery of our strategy. So, in that spirit, 
let me offer a window into the business of 
your Board in 2017: the issues which will 
dominate our agendas in the coming year 
and our plans to build further on the new 
governance approaches to risk mapping, 
stakeholder engagement and board 
development that we have implemented 
in recent years.
The first and key question we revisit at each 
meeting, and in the round each October, is 
whether we are pursuing the right strategy. 
It can be tempting to alter course in the face 
of strong headwinds. And this has been the 
subject of renewed challenge by your Board 
since our trading update in November.
Our strong and shared contention is that 
strategy is not about short-term adjustments; 
it is about staying true to our purpose and 
aligning ourselves with the fundamental 
forces – consumer power and choice, 
decentralisation and digitisation in particular 
– that are changing the energy world, 
affecting both our customers and the planet. 
So, we believe the answer to be clear. 
Nothing has happened to invalidate the 
strategy which we set out in 2015.
2017 was a difficult year for Centrica and,  
to my deep regret, for our shareholders.
Chairman’s Statement
Our vision is clear,  
our determination is 
unshakeable, our 
governance is robust 
and we are confident 
that we will return 
Centrica to real and 
sustainable growth.

Strategic Report | Chairman’s Statement In 2018, our focus is very much on strategy 
delivery and performance management. 
We are concentrating on those things which 
we can control and we are prioritising the 
performance of our existing businesses over 
expansion. We are confident that the shape 
of the business we now have is the right one 
to deliver growth over time and achieve our 
strategic goals. 
Meanwhile, we have continued to revise and 
refresh our approach to risk management to 
ensure that we have a stronger framework in 
place as we pursue our strategic objectives. 
In 2017 , we focused on embedding our 
redesigned process. The risk management 
framework makes a positive contribution to 
good decision-making and business growth 
and will be even stronger for the lessons 
learnt last year. Your Board discussed all 
aspects of our perceived risk exposure, 
with particular emphasis on process safety, 
political pressures, strategic delivery, cyber-
security, capability development and 
leadership succession. 
Inextricably linked to leadership succession 
is our approach to the attraction and 
retention of key people, a component of 
which relates to their remuneration. This year 
we are putting a new Remuneration Policy to 
the vote at our Annual General Meeting and 
have sought, through extensive dialogue, 
to understand and reflect the evolving 
consensus of the body of our investor base. 
We recognise in our recommended Policy 
an increasing investor discomfort with 
reward for input if and when performance 
outcomes are lagging.
So, we are proposing that annual bonuses 
should be more closely tied to shareholder 
experience, regardless of the quality and 
intensity of the Executive team efforts. Longer-
term reward remains very much aligned to the 
fortunes of shareholders, with deferred stock-
based schemes ensuring that only sustained 
performance and growth is rewarded. But to 
strengthen this link further, we are proposing 
to add a Total Shareholder Return measure 
to the Long Term Incentive Plan. More details 
are set out in the revised Remuneration Policy 
on pages 90 to 97 of this report.
Throughout 2017 , our Executive team 
worked tirelessly to deliver the first phase of 
the strategic transformation and, in the eyes 
of your Board, exceeded our expectations 
in their ability to close difficult divestments, 
navigate complex changes in the 
organisation in a very sensitive manner and 
bring home promised efficiency gains three 
years ahead of schedule. But that good 
strategic work was overshadowed by the 
disappointed expectations of short-term 
performance and the impact of UK 
government pressure, with the net result of 
a significant fall in the value of your Company.
Our current Remuneration Policy would 
have resulted in significant annual bonuses, 
though considerably less than last year, even 
after adjustment for the effects of weather 
and commodity prices. The impact of the 
painful shareholder experience of 2017 
would have had little impact on the 
calculated outcome. The newly proposed 
Remuneration Policy goes some way to 
redressing this mismatch. But, pending its 
adoption, your Board decided that discretion 
should be exercised under the current policy 
to reflect recent events, even though a 
significant portion of the impact was beyond 
the control of the Executive team.
Accordingly, no annual bonuses or pay 
rises were awarded to the Executive 
Directors for 2017 and, provided the new 
Remuneration Policy is adopted, stock awards 
under the forthcoming Long Term Incentive 
Plan will be reduced. This reinforces the 
broad and collective accountability of the 
Executive leadership.
In other matters, your Board spent much 
time over the past year ensuring that the 
business has the right teams in place with 
the right leadership style to achieve our 
strategic objectives. The future of our 
Company depends on having the best 
talent and on the motivation of that talent. 
Once again, our people have surpassed 
my expectations and I would like to thank 
them for all their hard work.
But we, as the leaders of this business, 
must do more to support our own people. 
Employee engagement levels fell again in 
2017 as the transition process continued. 
Our Gender Pay Statement showed that 
women at Centrica are paid on average 12% 
less than men, although we have a strong 
track record of equal pay for equal work. 
This gap can be explained in part by the 
legacy of traditionally male-dominated field 
engineering roles in our business. But it must 
be closed and we are committed to doing so.
So, I have asked our Non-Executive Director, 
Joan Gillman, to undertake a review of key 
employee matters and how we might assure 
ourselves that the voice of our people is 
being heard loud and clear in the boardroom. 
Joan has wide-ranging experience in the 
media and communications sector, with 
a very evident empathy towards the 
importance of engagement, teamwork and 
diversity. Her review will allow her to bring 
more Centrica-specific content to her 
boardroom contributions and challenge.
We bade farewell to Lesley Knox who 
stepped down after six years of much 
appreciated service as a Non-Executive 
Director, for which she has our sincere 
gratitude. We are in the process of seeking 
a successor who will bring, not only digital 
insights into customer segmentation and 
journeys, but also the voice of the customer 
into the boardroom, ensuring that we avoid 
circularity and insularity of thinking.
To that end, we in particular need to focus 
more on our weakest performance if we are 
truly to improve customer experience levels 
and open up the powerful possibility of our 
customers becoming our advocates. This 
is the most reliable route to dealing with the 
trust gap that confronts business as a whole 
and the energy supply sector in particular. 
As Board members, we all have personal 
experience of handling complaints from 
customers who contact us directly. We 
cannot help but be affected by what we 
sometimes hear. But the flow is still too 
anecdotal to be helpful in holding the 
Executive team to account on its drive to 
improve service. So, once recruited, I will be 
asking our new Non-Executive Director to 
consider how best to keep our boardroom 
dialogues deeply connected to our 
customers, their needs and our responses.
In summary, what we are trying to achieve 
at Centrica is not easy. In fact, it is one of the 
most ambitious changes attempted by any 
company in one of the most competitive and 
challenging sectors of the economy. But we 
are not doing this out of ambition. We are 
doing this because it is absolutely necessary 
for the future of this business that we adapt 
to the changes in the energy landscape and 
that we find new ways to meet the changing 
needs of our customers.
We believed this in 2015 when we set out our 
new strategic direction. We believe it now. 
Our future is in the hands of our customers 
and, by extension, our own hands. We may 
occasionally stumble on the road and be 
jostled by powerful external forces. But 
our vision is clear, our determination is 
unshakeable, our governance is robust 
and we are confident that we will return 
Centrica to real and sustainable growth.
