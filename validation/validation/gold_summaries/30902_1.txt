 Chief Executive’s review
Dear shareholder,
On 31 December 2016, Tullett Prebon 
acquired the Global Broking and 
Information Business of ICAP plc, creating 
TP ICAP, the world’s largest interdealer 
broker. As a result, 2017 was a year of 
significant change, growth and achievement 
for our new firm and our employees. 
TP ICAP has a unique position at the heart 
of the world’s financial and energy markets, 
providing liquidity and data to a broad 
and diverse array of market participants 
including banks, asset managers, hedge 
funds and energy and commodities firms. 
John Phizackerley
Chief Executive
Financial performance
During 2017, we have seen the benefit of 
the diversity of our product portfolio and 
geographic footprint and this has enabled 
us to deliver a resilient performance in a 
low interest rate, low volatility environment.
Underlying operating profit was £263m, 10% 
higher than the pro forma for 2016 of £240m 
and underlying operating profit margin of 
15.0% is 0.8 percentage points higher than 
in 2016 pro forma. Underlying earnings 
and earnings per share were £184m and 
33.3 pence per share compared to £188m 
and 34.0 pence per share pro forma for 2016.
Reflecting costs of the integration, statutory 
operating profit was £102m, 44% lower 
than the pro forma for 2016 of £181m and 
statutory operating profit margin of 5.8% is 
4.9 percentage points lower than in 2016 pro 
forma. Statutory earnings and earnings per 
share were £87m and 15.8 pence per share 
compared to £128m and 23.2 pence per 
share pro forma for 2016.
Integration progress
A key driver behind the transaction that 
created TP ICAP was the identification of 
synergies inherent in its combination. At the 
time of announcement of the transaction we 
estimated this to be £60m per year with the 
full run-rate to be achieved over three years. 
This has subsequently increased to a stretch 
target of £100m per year to be reached by 
2020. The majority of these savings come 
from support and infrastructure areas. 
Launching the integration was our top 
priority in 2017 and by the end of that  
first year we achieved annualised  
run-rate savings of £52m per year. 
We started the integration by appointing 
a unified senior management team made 
up of the best people from the two firms. 
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
12 Strategic report Single leaders for divisional, functional and 
corporate support areas were key to providing 
early clarity and direction to the organisation. 
At the same time, we moved quickly to 
constitute our governance structures, 
committees, policies and procedures. We have 
created single support functions in Finance, 
Legal, Risk, Compliance and HR, successfully 
co-located support staff and removed 
duplication. We have migrated our finance 
systems on to a single general ledger 
platform, rationalised our internal approvals 
processes, brought in globally aligned “Know 
Your Customer” and anti money laundering 
policies, and consolidated our swap execution 
facilities (‘SEFs’) from three to two. We have 
also embarked on the process of reducing the 
large number of redundant legal entities in 
the new combined corporate structure. 
In 2018, we are moving to phase 2 of 
the integration programme which will 
take us increasingly from integration to 
transformation. Not only do we aim to 
combine the infrastructure platforms of the 
two businesses but we seek to optimise and 
transform our operations to create a more 
efficient and scalable corporate function 
infrastructure. We will increase our 
capabilities and headcount in our Support 
Services Centre in Belfast as part of this 
programme. We also plan to extract 
efficiencies from procurement and from 
our non-compensation expense base.
In mid-2018, we will move in to our new US 
Headquarters in Lower Manhattan where all 
our New York brokers will be located under 
one roof. In addition, our combined UK-
based Energy & Commodities team will be 
housed in a single location in London’s West 
End. There are other office moves planned 
including a new London office in early 2019.
Business development
Our business lines are organised into four 
global divisions (Global Broking, Energy 
& Commodities, Data & Analytics and 
Institutional Services) and they all have 
inherent growth opportunities in 2018. 
Global Broking is the largest contributor to 
revenues and profits in the Group. Our focus 
is very much on increasing productivity 
through a range of initiatives including 
adopting and leveraging technology, 
selective new hires, active management of 
underperformers and a few selective desk 
mergers to leverage stronger relationships 
and liquidity pools where appropriate.
We provide our customers with efficient 
and effective ways of trading via multiple 
protocols, such as Central Limit Order 
Books (‘CLOB’), Volume Matching, Crossing 
Solutions and Request For Quote (‘RFQ’).
The Electronic Markets team is an integral 
part of the Global Broking division and is 
responsible for improving hybrid platform 
functionality, developing pure-electronic 
services, and enhancing our clients’ 
workflows. In 2017, our electronic Volume 
Matching platforms were functionally 
enriched and deployed into new products 
globally, resulting in record traded volumes 
and revenues were up 30% year-on-year. 
We launched an RFQ platform for FX 
Options, delivering a hybrid workflow with 
effective price discovery and the ability to 
disseminate liquidity to the market through 
an Applications Programme Interface (‘API’). 
Our brokers remain vital to our clients and 
key to our success and we focus on retaining 
star performers. While average broker 
pay-outs as a percentage of commissions 
declined again in 2017, actual revenue 
and contribution per broker rose.
TP ICAP is the world’s largest Energy & 
Commodities broker with offices in 20 
locations globally and coverage of a very 
broad set of products across three brands – 
T ullett Prebon, ICAP and PVM. It also has 
our most diverse customer base, with nearly 
90% of its revenue coming from non-banking 
clients, such as commodity producers and 
consumers, refiners, energy companies, 
utilities, hedge funds, asset managers and 
trading companies. 
“TP ICAP ended 2017 a larger ,  
stronger and more confident business.  
Our Group is more diverse in product  
offering and client reach than 
ever before.”

Average revenue per broker is the highest in 
this division. In January 2018, we acquired 
SCS Brokers, a US-based oil and softs 
brokerage company. We are consolidating 
seven back office deal management systems 
into one global platform. As in other parts of 
our business, we invest in technology, taking 
opportunities to deploy innovative solutions 
to give our clients the best service. 
In 2017, the Coalition survey of major bank 
revenues noted that commodities revenues 
have reached their lowest levels since 2006 
because of ongoing weakness in energy 
products, lower volatility, reduced client 
activity and trading underperformance.
Despite this difficult environment, we 
retained our leading position. With our 
diversified portfolio of businesses we are 
well-placed to take advantage of any 
increased market activity.
We plan to continue to grow our presence 
through recruiting more brokers. At the 
same time, we will continue to make the 
business more efficient and continue to 
invest in our platforms. 
We are enthusiastic about the prospects for 
our Data & Analytics business because it 
stands to benefit from rising demand for 
independent pricing products. We already 
represent the broadest global coverage in 
proprietary neutral OTC data, generated 
by our execution divisions, and we see 
the opportunity to add value through 
enhancing this existing dataset. 
We also have the potential to reach a 
wider customer base through the use of 
new technologies. In 2017 we continued 
to innovate, rolling out new services and 
products across a wide spectrum of asset 
classes. We added a pricing product in 
Government bond strips for GBP and EUR. 
We have added pricing products for the 
liquid natural gas markets. 
The implementation of MiFID II is also 
increasing demand for unbiased OTC pricing 
data. We are investing in our data sales 
capability and how we make those sales. 
We are also looking at increasing the range 
and pace of new product development 
and we are exploring the possibility of 
collaborating on creating OTC indices 
products underpinned by our data feeds. 
During 2017 , the Institutional Services division 
added agency FX, FX options, listed futures 
and options, and rates to its range of flow 
products. The division is also working closely 
with clients to develop and provide structured 
product solutions, such as asset backed loans, 
property derivatives, and secondary trading 
of hedge fund, private equity and real estate 
investments. We see great potential to grow 
our breadth of activities in this division and 
our acquisition of COEX Partners in November 
is an important part of this strategy. The 
company provides execution services in listed 
futures and options and FX, and brings more 
than 50 client facing employees with strong 
customer relationships. COEX has recently 
expanded its product range to include equity 
derivatives in the US.
This year, our focus will be on adding 
more breadth and depth to our footprint 
in EMEA, expanding in the US, and 
evaluating potential bolt on acquisitions.
People
We invested in and engaged with all our 
employees in 2017 . Retaining, recruiting and 
cultivating a diverse and talented workforce 
remains a key objective for the Group. 
We continued our multi-year recruitment 
campaign to bring in the next cohort of 
brokers. In June 2017, we conducted our first 
engagement survey as TP ICAP, achieving 
a 70% response. Understanding employee 
sentiment across a broad array of issues has 
allowed us to prioritise actions and shape 
our culture positively. 
Change has been a consistent theme 
throughout the year, and supporting our 
employees by providing formal training has 
helped equip them with the skills to achieve 
our integration objectives. As we continue 
to implement specific integration targets 
such as right-sizing the Group, we have 
endeavoured to be open and fair. 
We have created an employee representation 
forum in London called ‘involve’ and have 
mechanisms in place to consult and 
communicate with our staff. By the end of 
2017 , we achieved alignment across our main 
centres for key health benefits (medical, life 
assurance and income protection) reinforcing 
the importance of equitable treatment and 
emphasising the importance we attach to 
wellbeing at TP ICAP. 
Conduct and culture
We take every opportunity to emphasise 
the importance of conduct and culture at 
all levels of the Group. With regular 
communication we promote our agenda 
using events such as formal Town Halls, 
informal listening sessions and regular 
team meetings. 
At the end of 2017 all TP ICAP employees 
were required to watch a bespoke video 
called ‘Respect@Work’ which clearly set out 
the Company’s expectation for how people 
should interact and treat one another and 
what they should do if they see anything 
contrary to this in the workplace. Training 
employees on our standards and compliance 
with our policies is ongoing. 
In 2017, we published a new ‘Culture and 
Conduct Monitor’. This will assess specific 
elements of our culture and we will issue it 
twice a year. 
Finally, we continue to embed strong 
discipline in performance management 
through our annual year-end appraisal 
process for corporate support staff, 
and for our brokers we have instigated 
‘Performance, Conduct and Bonus’ forms 
which assess non-financial factors tied to our 
core values of Honesty, Integrity, Respect 
and Excellence. 
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
14 Strategic report At TP ICAP we are not afraid to do things 
differently. 
We have moved away from standard 
City hiring methods to help find the next 
generation of talent by investing in an 
Early Careers Programme (‘ECP’), open 
to candidates from all backgrounds. 
The ECP applicants undergo two stages of 
screening and profiling before we select a 
final group to take part in a Recruitment 
and Assessment Academy Day. Here, 
hopefuls take part in a series of skill-based 
tasks, a final interview and Q&A panel.

This selection methodology is blind to 
gender, ethnicity and academic background 
and is based purely on the key attributes of 
an individual and the needs of the business. 
In 2017, we held Academy Days in London 
and New York, receiving over 2,000 
applications globally and hiring 36 trainee 
brokers. The hires have a broad range of 
skills and backgrounds – including school 
leavers, graduates and ex-military. 
The ECP is part of our commitment to 
inclusive hiring, and we look forward to 
welcoming more new joiners in 2018.

Corporate responsibility
We know society has increasingly high 
expectations of us. We also know that our 
employees, and the next generation, care 
deeply about the sort of company they want 
to work for. 
Inter-dealer broking has always been an 
area where talented individuals can flourish, 
and it is our responsibility to ensure we cast 
the net far and wide when looking for, 
and developing, new talent. We call this 
‘A Voice for All’.
Our emphasis on corporate social 
responsibility and good corporate 
citizenship means we look for opportunities 
to help our communities and inform those 
who want to participate. For example, 
employees are given two days paid 
volunteering leave a year, and we make 
funds available to support their personal 
charitable fund-raising efforts. ICAP has a 
strong record in charitable support, and on 
5 December, held the 25th annual ICAP 
Charity Day. This long-established and 
well-loved tradition sees us come together 
across the globe to raise money for good 
causes, while also having a great deal of 
fun. As usual, the team participation was 
outstanding. This year we welcomed a host 
of celebrities and our guest of honour, the 
Duchess of Cornwall, to our offices in 
London, and events were held in locations 
around the globe. We raised more than 
£4.7m for this year’s chosen charities, 
bringing the grand total we have raised 
over the last 25 years to nearly £140m.
MiFID II
The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
II (‘MiFID II’) is a European Union law that 
provides harmonised regulation across the 
Member States with the aim of increasing 
competition and protection in investment 
services. Preparing for MiFID II, which came in 
to force on 3 January 2018, was a major 
workstream for TP ICAP during 2017 and the 
culmination of several years of investment 
and effort in many corporate areas. 
MiFID II has a broad impact on many facets 
of the functioning of European markets, 
including the trading in OTC products. The 
directive requires the trading of some OTC 
financial instruments to take place on a 
multilateral trading facility (‘MTF’) or an 
organised trading facility (‘OTF’) – the latter 
is a new type of venue that covers hybrid 
broking activity. These venues resemble 
in many ways traditional exchanges. 
We received regulatory approval for all 11 
of our venues in 2017. 
TP ICAP is a leading liquidity and market 
data provider in many major OTC asset 
classes. MifID II requires market participants 
to pursue best execution. We are confident 
that our venues will become the go-to hubs 
for the best liquidity, keenest pricing and the 
required data and analytics, assisting in 
this best execution obligation. The cost 
and sophistication to provide institutions 
with this value-chain requires significant 
resources. We believe that liquidity will 
gravitate towards the market players who 
can handle this complexity and make this 
level of investment. As a result, we are 
confident that MiFID II strengthens our 
value-proposition as a market infrastructure 
player and venue operator.
Brexit
Our work to prepare for Brexit has been 
hampered by political uncertainty which 
persists into 2018. As a result, we have 
now moved from analysis and planning, 
to decisions and action without a full 
understanding of the final outcome of the 
negotiations between the UK Government 
and the EU. We already have an extensive 
Continental European footprint including 
branches and subsidiaries, premises and 
front office and support staff that service EU 
clients from Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and 
Madrid. We are now in talks with a number 
of European financial regulators to establish 
what we and they require should TP ICAP 
base its post-Brexit European hub in one of 
their locations. During the coming year, we 
will need to do what is necessary to ensure 
we can provide uninterrupted service to our 
clients after Brexit and seek to avoid any 
consequential reductions in trading volumes.
Awards
We were pleased to win a number of industry 
awards during 2017, including Global 
Capital Overall Broker and Overall Interest 
Rates Broker of the Year, Credit Derivatives 
Interdealer Broker of the Year, and Data and 
Analytics Vendor of the Year. These awards 
are an endorsement of the strength of our 
offering, and testament to our commitment 
to excellent client service.
Looking ahead
TP ICAP ended 2017 a larger and stronger 
business. Our Group is more diverse in product 
offering and client reach than ever before and 
this positions us well to manage the cyclical 
and divergent nature of the markets and 
sectors we serve. I firmly believe that we will 
continue to play a central role providing 
liquidity at the heart of the global financial 
and energy markets enabling them to trade 
effectively and transparently.
Looking forward, political and economic 
factors are likely to continue to affect asset 
prices and volatility during 2018. This will 
present numerous opportunities. With a clear 
strategy and sustained focus on operational 
excellence, I am confident TP ICAP will 
continue to be resilient and successful. 
We are a truly international and culturally 
diverse business, employing people to 
provide first-rate services and expertise 
to our clients. I would like to thank everyone 
at TP ICAP for their hard work in 2017, and 
hope they will take pride in the business they 
helped create, and in the future success we 
intend to enjoy.
