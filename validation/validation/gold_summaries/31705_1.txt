  Our focus is to enhance our 
growth and market positions 
across both the Tamdown and 
TriConnex businesses as we 
continue to drive shareholder 
value. In order to do this our 
strategic priorities are focused 
on increasing market share 
within existing geographies, 
expansion into new regions, 
diversifying into new growth 
sectors and leveraging 
TriConnex as the UK’s leading 
provider of utility connections, 
to maximise opportunities for 
Tamdown. These goals can be 
achieved by a combination of 
organic growth and by selective 
bolt-on acquisitions, which 
meet with our strict criteria of 
being earnings enhancing and 
a cultural fit. 
 Additionally, we aim to attract, 
retain and develop the best 
people by investing in training 
and support which means we 
have a knowledgeable workforce 
with transferable skills. 
 We believe one of Nexus’ 
differentiating factors is our 
culture and commitment to 
customer service.
 What are the key 
highlights of the  
full year results?
 The key highlight for us this 
year has been the successful 
listing of the business in July on 
AIM. This is the first step on a 
journey for the Nexus Group as 
a publicly quoted company.
 The revenue being maintained 
at the prior year level, despite 
a period of uncertainty 
following the EU Referendum, 
demonstrates the robustness of 
the Nexus business model, our 
strong market positions and our 
proven track record as a trusted 
partner for our clients. 
 The order book is at a record 
level of £202.7m and with 
the continued investment in 
resources, the Group is well 
placed to deliver its growth plans. 
 What are your key 
priorities for the  
business going forward?
 Our ultimate aim is to 
build a business that is the 
leading provider of essential 
infrastructure services to the 
housebuilding and commercial 
sectors in the UK and to 
continue to create value for all 
our stakeholders. 
 In short, this means delivering 
a consistent strong financial 
performance, working in 
partnership and developing 
strategic relationships with our 
clients, whilst ensuring that 
our employees have the skills, 
experience and expertise to 
deliver time-critical quality 
services to all our customers.

6  In addition to the Help to 
Buy funding, the Government 
announced in the budget a 
variety of support packages 
to address the structural 
undersupply in the UK 
housebuilding market. The 
new policies are expected to 
bring the total support for 
housing to at least £44bn over 
the next five years, with the 
intention of increasing the 
number of houses completed 
to 300,000 per year by 2025. 
In addition, the Government 
have committed to improving 
the planning environment and 
making more public sector 
land available for residential 
development.
 Nexus predominantly operates 
within the more economically 
resilient areas of the South 
East of England and London, 
where we believe the housing 
shortage is even more acute 
than other parts of the UK. 
 We’re confident that both 
Tamdown and TriConnex will 
benefit from this landscape 
of structural undersupply in 
housing, Government stimulus 
for the sector and a drive 
to increase volumes from 
customers operating in the 
affordable housing market. 
 You mention that you  
will be focusing on 
enhancing value for  
all stakeholders, what 
exactly do you mean  
by that?
 Our aim is to be an investment 
for our shareholders that 
both grows in value as well as 
providing a good return. Our 
dividend policy is stated to be 
progressive, whilst maintaining 
an appropriate level of dividend 
cover. Our Board’s current target 
is to pay annual dividends 
based on a dividend cover of 
3.0 times the Group’s adjusted 
profit after tax. 
 Other key stakeholders are our 
clients and employees. Our 
clients are front of mind in 
terms of our aim to continue to 
develop partnerships with them, 
providing excellent services, 
advice and support which 
enables the housebuilders to 
deliver quality housing on time 
and on budget. 
 With its existing very strong 
base of blue-chip customers, 
including nine of the top ten 
largest housebuilders in the UK, 
Tamdown has the expertise and 
experience to continue to deliver 
services on multi-phase projects 
across a broad range of regions. 
 With the deregulation of 
the utilities market, Nexus 
through TriConnex, can 
provide innovative added value 
services for housebuilders 
and commercial real estate 
clients. TriConnex has already 
developed a reputation 
for customer focus and 
responsiveness, flexibility, 
quality of service and reliability 
in this respect. 
 We believe we have an 
exceptional workforce and we 
seek to continue to attract and 
retain the best people through 
competitive pay, a culture 
of empowerment, attractive 
training and development 
schemes and future leadership 
programmes. We offer 
apprenticeships, high levels of 
training and development, a 
graduate programme and a 
degree programme.
 In terms of your key 
markets – housebuilding 
and commercial property, 
what is your view of these 
markets?
 As you are probably aware, the 
Government announced in 
October that the Help to Buy 
equity scheme will receive an 
additional £10bn of funding to 
support the purchase of homes. 
The new funding is nearly 50% 
higher than that used in the 
first four years of the scheme’s 
life and adds to the £5.4bn of 
previous funding, which to date 
has assisted in the sale of more 
than 134,000 homes.
