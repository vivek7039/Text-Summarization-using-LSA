 Spread bet
The Group’s spread betting product is offered exclusively in the 
UK and Ireland as profits from spread betting are currently free 
from capital gains tax and stamp duty in these jurisdictions. 
Spread betting provides similar economic benefits to those 
experienced when investing in an underlying asset, but without 
the costs and limitations associated with physical ownership. 
With a spread bet a client bets a specific stake size per point 
movement of an instrument, rather than trading a specific 
number of shares or units. Our spread betting instruments 
allow a client to take long or short positions. As spread betting 
is a leveraged product, losses can exceed deposits. 
Example 
If a client feels that the price of a particular instrument is likely 
to fall, they can place a sell bet or ‘go short’ . Conversely, if they 
believed that the price will go up, they can place a buy bet, or ‘go 
long’ . If the market moved in the direction they predicted, they 
make a profit. If the market moves in the opposite direction to 
what they predicted, they make a loss. 
When you spread bet, you buy or sell an amount per point 
movement, such as £5 per point, which is known as your ‘stake’ . 
For every point the instrument’s price moves in your favour, you 
gain a multiple of your stake. For every point the price moves 
against you, you lose a multiple of your stake.
CFD
A CFD is a cash-settled investment based on currencies, 
commodities, treasuries, indices and shares, providing economic 
benefits similar to an investment in an underlying asset without 
certain costs and limitations associated with physical ownership. 
A CFD is a leveraged product which has the potential to magnify 
profits as well as losses. In the UK, CFD trades currently do not 
incur stamp duty tax charges, in contrast to trades in traditional 
financial investments, such as equity securities. Our clients can 
trade in fractions of units per CFD, and we charge commission 
on CFD trades for equity shares while there is a spread charge 
for all other asset classes. Our CFD instruments allow a client to 
take long or short positions. As a CFD is a leveraged product, the 
Group requires varying levels of margin to be posted in respect 
of the full value of a client’s position. Margins vary depending 
on a client’s position and the type of instrument in which the 
client invests.
Example 
If a client believes that the price of a particular instrument 
is likely to fall, they could place a sell trade or ‘go short’ . 
Conversely, if they think the price will rise, they could place a buy 
trade or ’go long’ . If the market moved in the direction they 
predicted, they would make a profit. If the market moved in the 
opposite direction, they would make a loss. When you trade 
CFDs, you buy or sell a number of units. For every point the 
price of the instrument moves in your favour, you gain based on 
the number of units you have bought or sold. For every point the 
price moves against you, you make a loss.

Stockbroking (Australia only)
CMC Markets offers Australian clients the opportunity to trade Australian shares on the ASX and SSX. Clients can choose from a wide 
variety of investment instruments, including shares, managed funds, warrants and ETFs. The Group offers two stockbroking platforms: 
the Standard platform, which provides everyday self-directed investors with advanced tools and research; and the Pro platform, which 
gives frequent traders integrated access to institutional-like trading tools and professional charting.
Binaries and Countdowns
Countdowns is a limited risk product that enables clients to 
place trades over a range of short-term timeframes. The client 
decides the timeframe starting from time of trade as opposed 
to selecting a pre-determined expiry time. Countdowns has 
been rolled out internationally to the majority of markets where 
the Group has an office and has proven popular with both new 
and existing clients.
The Group also offers binaries in the majority of its 
international markets. With binaries, the client’s risk and 
potential profit are determined at the point of trade entry. 
Clients are offered the opportunity to place a trade depending 
on whether they believe a particular market’s price will be 
above or below a certain level at a specific time in the future. If 
their trade is “in the money” at the end of the specified 
timeframe, they will be credited with the amount agreed at the 
point of trade entry; if they are “out of the money” they will 
forfeit their stake. Clients also have the opportunity to close a 
binary trade prior to the time of expiry as the odds of the 
instrument being above or below a pre-determined level 
change when the price in the underlying market changes. The 
Group offers four types of binaries: Ladder, One T ouch, Up/
Down and Range across 22 instruments including certain 
indices, commodities and FX pairs.
*  Binary prices are always quoted between 0 & 100. If the price is closer to 100 then we are pricing the event as more likely to occur, while if the price is closer to 0 
then we are pricing the event as less likely to occur.
  If you believe the binary event will not occur you can sell the binary. In the example above you would sell the binary at 18.5 and if the event does not happen your 
profit is equal to (18.5 – 0) x £5  £92.50. If the event did occur then your loss is equal to (18.5 – 100) x £5  -£407.50.
**  Binary positions may be closed partially or fully prior to the binary expiry except for during the ‘Pre-Close’ period which may be different for each product and expiry.

therefore the binary 
ﬁnished below the strike 
price and settles at 0
 
Loss = (0 – 27.4) x £5
= -£137
 
* If the Countdowns price finishes equal with the settlement price at the end of the expiry, the trade will end in a draw and a percentage of your stake is returned. The 
percentage of your stake returned will differ depending on the product traded and expiry.
 If you believe the settlement price will finish below the Countdowns price at the end of the expiry then you can choose to place a ‘Below’ trade. If the price finished below at 
expiry then you would receive a payout of £36 ((£20 x 80%) + £20 initial stake). If it finished above then your loss would be limited to your stake size of £20.
