 Overview | Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 8
In the Strategy section from page 12 of  
this Annual Report, we talk more about  
the background to our strategy and the 
review we are undertaking. For the rest  
of my Review I want to look at the progress 
we made towards our goals in 2012, as  
well as consider some of the setbacks  
we encountered.
Scientiﬁc leadership
In a research and development-based 
business such as AstraZeneca, I believe 
that everything starts with a focus  
on patients and great science. It is our  
ﬁrst priority.
AstraZeneca has a unique combination  
of scientiﬁc capabilities in small molecules, 
biologics, immunotherapies and antibody 
engineering. This puts us in a strong 
position to develop the targeted novel 
medicines and combinations (such as 
drug-antibody conjugates) required to meet 
patient needs in the future. Reviews that  
we have held with scientiﬁc experts outside 
AstraZeneca have further reinforced my 
conﬁdence in our underlying science base.
We have much to do to realise our full 
scientiﬁc potential but made some progress 
in 2012. On the regulatory front, we received 
approvals in Europe for Zinforo, our 
intravenous antibiotic, Caprelsa, our thyroid 
cancer treatment, and Forxiga, a product  
of our diabetes alliance with BMS. In the  
US, FluMist Quadrivalent was approved,  
the ﬁrst four-strain inﬂuenza vaccine  
to be approved by the FDA.
I am both excited and honoured to  
have been asked to lead AstraZeneca. 
Throughout my career I have had enormous 
respect for its people and what they have 
achieved. Since joining in October, I have 
seen for myself the passion and commitment 
that exists within the Group to improve the 
lives of patients around the world. 
This level of energy should come as no 
surprise as our innovative medicines mean 
that more people than ever before are  
able to lead longer and healthier lives.  
As we seek to show throughout this  
Annual Report, successful pharmaceutical 
innovation, delivered responsibly, adds  
value not only for patients and shareholders 
but also for healthcare systems and the 
communities in which we work.
The challenge
Leif has already described in his Chairman’s 
Statement how, in addition to the well-known 
challenges that confront the pharmaceutical 
sector, the loss of exclusivity of several  
of our major brands largely deﬁned 
AstraZeneca’s ﬁnancial performance in 
2012. I believe that our ability to provide  
an acceptable level of return to you in the 
years ahead will come from an undiluted 
focus on delivering great medicines to 
patients through innovative science and 
global excellence in development and 
commercialisation. Underpinning that  
focus are three priorities: achieving  
scientiﬁc leadership, returning AstraZeneca 
to growth and making it a great place  
to work.
Across the entire pipeline of 84 projects,  
39 successfully progressed to the next 
stage of testing in 2012, including 12 
projects into ﬁrst human testing. Nineteen 
projects were withdrawn. While we met  
our target for Phase III investment decisions 
for the year, we did not meet our value 
targets for those projects.
To increase the value of our pipeline, we aim 
to access the best science and molecules 
regardless of origin. Our portfolio was 
strengthened during the year by a number 
of successful business development 
initiatives. Our collaboration with Amgen 
encompasses ﬁve clinical stage projects in 
inﬂammation, including brodalumab, which 
has already entered Phase III development. 
In April 2012, we entered into an agreement 
to acquire Ardea, which added lesinurad,  
a Phase III project for the treatment of gout, 
to our portfolio. We also signiﬁcantly 
expanded our diabetes alliance with BMS 
through its acquisition of Amylin.
Overall, we completed a record number  
of more than 60 important business 
development deals in 2012 that helped  
us to strengthen our scientiﬁc leadership  
in key therapeutic areas, expand our 
pipeline and improve our capabilities. They 
also helped underpin business growth in 
both Established and Emerging Markets.
Return to growth
Our second priority must be to return 
AstraZeneca to growth. Our performance  
in 2012 reﬂected a period of signiﬁcant 
patent expiry and tough market conditions 
globally. Despite the challenges we  
face, I am excited about AstraZeneca’s 
fundamental strengths, which will be key  
in returning AstraZeneca to growth.

Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Brilinta/Brilique, our treatment for acute 
coronary syndromes, is now approved  
in 88 countries and launched in 82. I believe 
that, while performance since its launch  
has been disappointing, especially in the 
US, Brilinta/Brilique has the potential to 
become a major product for AstraZeneca, 
given its signiﬁcant mortality beneﬁts relative 
to the standard of care. We have moved 
quickly to improve our sales, marketing  
and medical support to this important 
medicine. Early indications from some 
markets, combined with the favourable 
proﬁle of this medicine, suggest that we  
are on the right path.
Taking full advantage of our expanded 
diabetes alliance with BMS also presents  
a signiﬁcant opportunity. With the addition 
of Amylin products such as Byetta and 
Bydureon, we now have treatment options 
for patients from early stages of Type 2 
diabetes to the pre-insulin stage. The launch 
of the extended portfolio in the US, only  
a few weeks after we concluded the deal, 
demonstrates how swiftly we can move  
to bring a range of treatment options  
to physicians and their patients. 
With our well-established commercial 
strength, we are in a strong position to  
bring our medicines to patients in Emerging 
Markets. Conditions have been tough in 
Mexico, Brazil and some other markets,  
but strong growth in countries such as 
Russia and China shows how much our 
products are valued in these markets.
A great place to work
Skilled, committed employees are essential 
if AstraZeneca is to realise its full potential. 
Unfortunately, the 2012 global employee 
survey showed a reduction in the scores  
in the majority of categories. These scores 
were disappointing. While they might be 
regarded as understandable given our 
challenging environment and the ongoing 
transformation of the business, my SET 
colleagues and I are committed to working 
harder to ensure employees have an 
improved understanding and conﬁdence  
in our future direction.
More positively, it was encouraging to  
see the high level of motivation that exists 
across AstraZeneca to help us succeed. 
This was something I witnessed at ﬁrst hand 
as I spent time with colleagues on site in the 
weeks after I joined the organisation. I want 
to build on this and make AstraZeneca a 
great place to work – a simpliﬁed business 
that comprises a diverse and talented 
workforce operating in a high performance 
culture, which enables us to bring great 
medicines to patients.
Senior Executive Team
In January 2013, we announced changes  
to our Senior Executive Team, which were 
designed to provide sharper management 
focus, as well as devolving and accelerating 
decision making. Changes include 
increased representation of the Company’s 
scientiﬁc expertise, product portfolio and 
key regions. Members of the new SET  
are shown on pages 108 and 109 and  
I look forward to working with them all on 
delivering our strategic goals. As a result  
of the changes, two senior roles were 
eliminated – President of R&D, held by 
Martin Mackay, and Executive Vice-
President, Global Commercial, held  
by Tony Zook. Both Martin and Tony  
left their respective roles in January  
2013, and I would like to thank them  
for their contribution and the exemplary 
leadership they have shown.
Innovation and growth
In closing, I would like to thank everyone in 
AstraZeneca for their support and making 
me feel so welcome. My ﬁrst three months 
as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer conﬁrmed the 
nature and scale of the challenges we face. 
Those months also conﬁrmed my view that 
within the organisation we have both the 
capabilities and skills necessary to achieve 
scientiﬁc leadership, return to growth and  
be a great place to work. I am sure that  
by being true to our mission of bringing 
innovative medicines to patients we can 
meet our short- and medium-term goals 
and thereby deliver our longer term 
aspirations for the business.

Our innovative medicines are playing a part in increasing survival rates and 
improving quality of life for patients in important areas of medical need.
For example, Brilinta/Brilique, our treatment for acute coronary syndromes, shows a 21% relative reduction in cardiovascular 
mortality against the current standard of care over a 12 month duration of therapy. 
In the UK, the government has announced it is to extend the inﬂuenza vaccination programme to all children, recommending  
use of our nasal spray vaccine, Fluenz. Even with moderate vaccination uptake, the UK alone could see around a 40% drop  
in the number of people affected. That would mean at least 11,000 fewer hospitalisations as a result of inﬂuenza and around  
2,000 fewer deaths a year. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 11

Innovation is not always about ‘breakthrough’ discoveries – medical progress 
can often be delivered just as effectively through incremental improvements.
