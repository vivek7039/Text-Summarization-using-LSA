TENURE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
I am pleased to be able to address 
Shareholders for the first time as Chairman 
of Helical. After leading the Company 
as Chief Executive for 32 years I was 
delighted the Board selected Gerald Kaye 
to be my successor and am confident 
he will lead the Company with distinction 
for many years. 
The Company has had a good year 
despite an uncertain background 
following the decision to leave the 
European Union. The rationalisation of 
the portfolio leaves the Company with 
a focused portfolio balanced between 
a London investment and development 
programme providing both capital and 
rental growth opportunities and a high 
yielding regional investment portfolio. 
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
The composition of the Board is discussed 
in greater detail in the Nominations 
Committee Report on pages 76 to 77. 
Following the changes implemented at 
the 2016 AGM, the Board consists of a 
Non-Executive Chairman, four Executive 
Directors and five independent Non-
Executive Directors, a balance which 
satisfies governance requirements for 
a FTSE 350 Company, notwithstanding 
that we are currently outside of that index. 
There are no changes proposed at the 
AGM on the 13 July 2017 and none are 
anticipated before 2019. Good governance 
is reflected in the contribution that a 
diverse Board offers and the Company 
will seek to make further progress in this 
area in future years. 
BOARD DECISIONS
Much of the year was taken up in 
discussion of the changing economic 
and political environment and outlook 
for our markets, against a background of 
the decision to leave the European Union 
and other geopolitical factors. In addition, 
the Board meeting agendas during the 
year contained many issues including:
• A review of the Group’s corporate, 
property and financial strategy; 
• A complete review of the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 and the 
introduction of new policies on 
diversity and slavery;
• Consideration and approval of significant 
property transactions; and,
• Completion of the changes to the 
composition of the Board as outlined  
on page 76.
It has been another good year at Helical with a 
reshaping of the Board completed, equity recycled 
through the sale of almost £200m of assets and 
the Company’s activities streamlined. We have 
also sought to strengthen our compliance with 
Corporate Governance requirements.

CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW ANNUAL STRATEGY REVIEW 
In March 2017, the Board considered 
the Executive Directors’ Annual Strategy 
Review of the business, examining the 
economic, geopolitical, societal and 
environmental risks affecting the business. 
This review reaffirmed the Company’s 
principal objective of combining 
investment and development activity 
to ensure maximum shareholder returns 
whilst managing risks appropriately. 
BOARD EVALUATION 
For the first time, the Board Evaluation 
was undertaken by an external advisor 
and the results of this review are outlined 
in the Governance Review on pages 72 
to 75. I am pleased to report that the 
overall findings noted that Helical has 
an effective Board with many strengths. 
Recognising that some improvements 
can be made, the Governance Review 
also notes the actions to be taken during 
the year to 31 March 2018 and I will 
be reporting on these in the 2018 
Annual Report. 
BOARD COMMITTEES
The work of the Nominations, 
Remuneration and Audit and Risk 
Committees are discussed in detail in 
their individual reports on pages 76 to 97. 
With regard to remuneration and in the 
light of increasing shareholder scrutiny 
of this area I note that Shareholders 
approved the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy at the 2016 AGM with 97% in favour 
and no changes are being proposed at 
the 2017 AGM.
INVESTOR RELATIONS
We have an extensive programme 
of meetings and presentations with 
shareholders throughout the year with 
the majority of these taking place in the 
periods following our annual and half 
year results. 
The Chief Executive, Gerald Kaye, 
and the Finance Director, Tim Murphy, 
attended the majority of these meetings 
during the year with the remaining 
Executive Directors, Duncan Walker and 
Matthew Bonning-Snook, also attending 
as appropriate. The Senior Independent 
Director, Richard Gillingwater, attended 
a small number of meetings. Richard 
Gillingwater and I are available to meet 
Shareholders if they wish to discuss any 
matters with us. 
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow 
Non-Executive Directors, Gerald Kaye and 
his Executive team, the senior property 
professionals, finance team and all the 
staff for their hard work during the year. 
The following pages describe in greater 
detail our governance structure and the 
work of the Board and its Committees.
