The Property Franchise Group PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We provide responsive local lettings 
and sales services nationally through 
recognised property brands
What we do
Lettings and property management
We are one of the largest managing agents  
in the UK of residential properties with a deep 
understanding of lettings and a clear view of 
how to develop value in the long term from  
a portfolio. Our franchisees are fully insured 
members of professional bodies, supported 
by specialist software, who know their  
local rental market and manage all  
properties locally.
Estate Agency
We operate on a no sale no fee basis. We 
cater both for the majority of sellers who 
prefer to instruct an agent operating from 
high street premises and for the growing 
segment of sellers who choose to use an 
agent without a high street office. Two of our 
brands have been engaged in estate agency 
for more than 150 years.
How we do it
We rely on the motive power of local people 
who are committed to operating franchises 
under our brands to the highest levels of 
professionalism and service. Our brands are 
household names in their local communities, 
regions and nationally. Whilst the majority  
of franchisees operate through high street 
offices and have been with us for many years,  
a growing number of new franchisees choose 
to offer a 24/7 online service though 
EweMove.
Our success
We are a multi-award winning group with 
recent successes including gold for EweMove 
for best franchise estate agency at the  
Sunday Times awards in 2016 and silver for 
best franchise at the 2017 Negotiator awards. 
Just as importantly we have grown the 
revenue of our network of franchises through 
joint effort and support year on year  
since 2005.
Where we focus 
The Group has a strong 
presence in lettings and 
currently manages 52,000 
properties on behalf of 
landlords which amounts 
to a town the size of 
Gateshead. It also has a 
growing presence in 
estate agency.

Launched in late 2013, EweMove has rapidly grown to a network  
of 120 franchises at the year end. The EweMove franchise model 
combines the recruitment of local property experts (“LPEs”), 
typically serving micro territories of 20,000 households through a 
centralised 24/7 technology platform, with the traditional features 
of a full estate agency service and a consumer fee predicated  
on completed sales, rather than listings. It has been the UK’s  
“No 1 Most Trusted Agent” on Trustpilot since 2016.
