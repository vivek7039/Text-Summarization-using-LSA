Chief Executive’s review
“2017 has once again demonstrated the quality of Bodycote’s business. 
The Group’s revenue growth, combined with continued discipline on 
costs, helped lift headline operating profit by 24%. Return on sales 
increased to 18.0% from 16.6%. ”
S. C. Harris
Group Chief Executive
Overview
Bodycote reported revenue growth of 14.9% to £690.2m (2016: 
£600.6m), with revenue benefiting from foreign exchange translation 
gain. At constant currency, revenues grew 9.6%, including a 
contribution of 2.9% from acquisitions completed in 2016.
The following review reflects constant currency growth rates unless 
stated otherwise.
General industrial markets returned to growth after a multi-
year negative trend. Moreover, this growth was broad-based, 
with improvements in general industrial demand occurring in 
all of our served geographies. Group revenues generated from 
the general industrial sectors, which represent some 39% of 
our business, grew 10%, which was well above the growth in 
background demand. Of this growth, 4 percentage points came 
from acquisitions made in 2016. The remainder of the Group’s 
outperformance in general industrial versus the market came from 
the increased penetration of Specialist Technologies (which grew 
14% in this sector), as well as an element of some customer 
restocking. 
The decision we took to preserve the capacity at our T exas/Oklahoma 
facilities is being well rewarded, as we have also seen a reversal of 
the sharp declines that we had experienced in onshore oil & gas 
demand. Growth in onshore oil & gas saw a strong sequential increase 
in 2017 , driven predominantly by demand from unconventional drilling 
activity in the Permian Basin. In the rest of the energy sector, subsea 
revenues continued to decline and large-frame industrial gas turbines 
(IGT) are also in retreat following cutbacks at the original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs). It is worth noting, however, that requests for 
quotation in the subsea sector have picked up considerably. In total, 
revenues from the energy sector increased by 4%.
Civil aviation grew 6% with our UK operations continuing to add 
significant business. This increase will require new facilities to 
be built in 2018 in the UK in order to service forecast demand. 
North America also started to contribute to the growth in a more 
meaningful way as the build rate of LEAP engines continues to 
grow. Bodycote has a much stronger position on the LEAP series 
than it did on the previous CFM56, which is a testament to the 
success of the focused sales and investment programme that has 
been undertaken over the last decade.

The automotive business saw growth of 14% with the majority 
of this increase coming from the car and light truck sector. This 
compares to background demand growth in Europe of low single 
digits and a slight decline in the USA. Our strong performance 
benefited from the contribution from the acquisitions made in 2016, 
together with the investments we have made in Emerging Markets 
and Specialist T echnologies. 
In our Specialist Technologies, we achieved double-digit revenue 
growth across our Specialty Stainless Steel Processes (S
3
P), low 
pressure carburising (LPC) and Corr-I-Dur
®
 (CiD) technologies. 
However, several factors dragged on overall sales growth during the 
year. The HIP Product Fabrication (HIP PF) and Surface Technology 
businesses are focused largely on oil & gas outside of the USA, 
with particular emphasis on subsea and these revenues continued 
to decline. In addition the weakness in IGT volumes resulted in a 
slowdown in the HIP Services business towards the end of the 
year. Also impacting our HIP Services business was an unplanned 
outage during the second half (which was fully resolved by year 
end). Forecast growth in all the Specialist Technologies looks strong. 
The five sites we acquired in 2016 are performing well. They  
are all Classical Heat Treatment sites within the AGI division and 
contributed £23.0m of revenue in 2017 , with return on sales in line 
with the Group. It is also worth highlighting that revenues at these 
facilities have accelerated since coming into the Group as a result 
of the benefits derived from being part of the Group’s network of 
facilities.
With careful cost discipline in the face of growing revenues,  
the Group’s headline operating profit grew 24% to £123.9m  
(26% growth in statutory operating profit to £119.4m) and the 
return on sales improved to 18.0% (2016: 16.6%). Once again, 
we increased our prices ahead of cost inflation. This is an area of 
heightened focus for the Group especially as we are entering a 
period of higher input cost inflation in some markets. It is worth 
noting, however, that Bodycote typically performs well in higher 
inflationary environments.
The Group’s strong profit improvement, coupled with a headline tax 
rate of 22.9% (2016: 27 .5%), increased basic headline earnings per 
share to 49.2p (2016: 37 .0p). Basic earnings per share increased to 
51 .0p from 35.2p.
The return on capital employed rose in the current year to 19.3% 
from 17 .1% in 2016. 
Free cash flow increased to £83.0m (2016: £60.5m) as a result 
of our improved profitability and in spite of increased capital 
expenditure to support the future growth of the business. Headline 
operating cash conversion was, once again, above 90%, yielding a 
net cash position at the end of the year of £39.6m (2016: £1 .1m).
Strategic progress
The Group’s strategy encompasses the drive for operational 
efficiency and improvement in return on sales; growth in markets 
with higher long term structural growth; the expansion of the 
Group’s footprint in rapid growth markets; the focus on revenue 
growth in Specialist Technologies; and growth through targeted 
acquisitions, where these are more attractive than investing in new 
facilities. The Group has a minimum 20% hurdle rate return when 
looking at investments.
During 2017 we made further progress against our strategy, 
delivering higher Group return on sales of 18.0%. We believe there 
is still the opportunity to further improve from both management 
led initiatives, particularly in our AGI division, and growth in our 
higher return Specialist Technologies. 
In 2017 we continued to invest in areas with superior growth 
potential, with a deliberate bias towards investments in rapid-
growth markets, Specialist Technologies, and long-cycle 
programmes, particularly in civil aviation: Emerging Markets 
revenues increased 26% to £54.1m, representing 8% of Group 
turnover, with growth in Mexico and China both above 40%. We 
will continue to invest to support the future of our business in these 
rapid growth markets. During the year, we commissioned several 
new LPC and S
3
P lines. In HIP Services we acquired the HIP assets 
from Doncasters Group Limited’s UK business and a new mega-HIP 
was ordered for Europe which will come online in 2018. Further 
new facilities are expected to be commissioned in 2018 for both 
Specialist Technologies and Classical Heat Treatment in our focus 
geographies and markets. The additional capacity that will come on 
stream in 2018 will add to our ability to deliver strong growth and 
superior return on sales over the coming years.
We also continue to look at acquisition and investment 
opportunities that will grow our business. These are traditionally 
small bolt-on facilities that can provide us with infills to our existing 
network. Where opportunities to buy such facilities do not exist, 
we will build new facilities; these obviously have a ramp-up period, 
but have the advantage of being designed exactly in line with the 
Group’s technology and operational efficiency focus. Since 2014 
we have invested £164m in both acquisitions and investment for 
growth in new and existing facilities, with revenues from the latter 
still ramping up as these plants typically take 3–5 years to reach full 
production. 
Organisation and people
Bodycote is a service business, and first-class service is delivered 
by passionate and professional people, who understand their 
customers’ needs and meet their demanding requirements time 
and time again. We will continue to invest in training and developing 
our employees to ensure that our talented workforce remains one 
of our competitive advantages.
Summary and outlook 
2017 has once again demonstrated the quality of Bodycote’s 
business. Strong growth was achieved through contributions 
from contract wins on automotive and aerospace programmes, 
excellent growth in Emerging Markets (where our investments are 
yielding good returns), and broad-based growth across the general 
industrial sectors, an element of which was due to some customer 
restocking.
The Group’s revenue growth, combined with continued discipline 
on costs, helped lift headline operating profit by 24%. Return on 
sales increased to 18.0% from 16.6%.
To ensure that the business continues to deliver good results, we 
will continue to focus on efficiency, maintaining price discipline 
in light of increasing inflation across many economies, and the 
execution of our successful strategy.
Our business, by its nature, has limited forward visibility, but we 
have entered the year with good momentum. Accordingly, and in 
spite of the foreign exchange headwind at current exchange rates, 
2018 has started in line with our expectations.
