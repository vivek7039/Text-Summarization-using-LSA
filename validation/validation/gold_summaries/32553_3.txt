 I am delighted to report that the Group 
has delivered good results in 2016/17.
Strategic progress
The strategic plan set out by the 
management team in May 2015 is 
progressing well. Identity Solutions and 
Product Authentication businesses 
delivered strong revenue and operating 
profit growth, further improving and 
diversifying our business mix, while 
the currency business performed 
with resilience.
In January 2017, we completed our first 
acquisition in 14 years, adding DuPont 
Authentication to the De La Rue family. 
With a strong intellectual property 
portfolio, global blue-chip customers and 
a committed and experienced workforce, 
it is an excellent strategic fit and will 
be a great addition to the Group. 
The banknote manufacturing footprint 
restructuring programme is progressing 
to plan. Our continuous focus on improving 
efficiency and careful allocation of capital 
has provided a solid platform to support 
further growth. 
We completed the sale of the 
underperforming Cash Processing 
Solutions business in May 2016. 
Financial performance
Revenue grew 2% overall, reflecting 
the strong volumes from the Currency 
segment and the good progress made 
in the Identity Solutions and Product 
Authentication businesses during the 
year. Adjusted operating profit* was 
similar to last year at £70.7m despite 
the conclusion of a material security 
features contract last year. On an IFRS 
basis operating profit was £70.2m, up 
from £66.8m last year, reflecting lower 
exceptional charges in the current year. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share* 
decreased by 2% due to the benefit of a 
non-recurring tax benefit in the prior year.
Cash generated from operating 
activities, which includes the impact 
of discontinued operations, was up 9% 
at £64.3m. The benefit of higher profits 
in the year was offset by adverse working 
capital movements due to the timing of 
shipments and a reduction in advanced 
payments. Following the $25m acquisition 
of DuPont Authentication, which was 
funded from the existing credit facility, 
net debt as at 25 March 2017 increased 
by £14.8m to £120.9m.
Dividend
In order to deliver long term shareholder 
value and maintain financial flexibility 
to sustain future growth, the Board 
proposes to leave the dividend 
unchanged and is recommending 
a final dividend of 16.7p per share 
(2015/16: 16.7p per share). This, together 
with the 8.3p paid in January 2017, 
will make a full year dividend of 25.0p 
per share. 
The Board
The Board and I feel that we have the 
right balance of skills and experience 
to support the management team. 
The appointment on 21 July 2016 of 
Nick Bray, Chief Financial Officer of 
Sophos Group plc, as a Non-executive 
Director and Chair of the Audit Committee, 
has further strengthened the Board. 
Nick brings extensive experience in 
the technology and information security 
industries and we welcome him on board.
Rupert Middleton, Chief Operating Officer 
and Executive Director, has informed the 
Board of his intention to step down from 
the Board after the AGM on 20 July 2017. 
We are grateful for his contribution and 
wish him well for his future. The position 
will be replaced by the newly created role 
of Chief Operations Director which will 
not be a Board position. A search has 
commenced to identify suitable internal 
and external candidates.
Culture and people
We are committed to fostering a 
dynamic, agile and high performing 
culture that drives the growth of the 
business. Our people are critical to the 
successful execution of our strategy and 
to fulfilling our purpose. We continue to 
engage with and invest in our people 
through training and development.
In December 2016, we undertook an 
employee survey and were delighted 
that 85% of our colleagues participated 
and provided us with their feedback. 
While the results of the survey were 
highly encouraging, we recognise 
we have more to do in a number of 
areas and the survey provides us with 
invaluable insights to act upon. 
142
Countries exported to in the last three years.
3,150
We employ around 3,150 people worldwide.
Our people are committed to serving 
our customers and are often the 
difference between De La Rue and our 
competitors. In 2016/17, they managed 
to deliver high volumes in both print 
and paper despite the disruptions from 
the footprint restructuring programme. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank them for their continued 
commitment and dedication. 
Corporate responsibility
I am proud that we have signed the UN 
Global Compact, aligning our strategy 
and operations with the principles 
on human rights, labour, environment 
and anti-corruption. In line with our 
core values, we are committed to the 
integration of broader social, ethical, 
and sustainable practices across our 
day-to-day business. Further information 
can be found in our corporate responsibility 
section on pages 42 to 49.
Outlook
We started the year with good momentum 
and a strong order book of £387m. 
While the sustained weakness of sterling 
gives us a competitive advantage in the 
export market, most of our sales are 
invoiced in sterling and therefore do not 
automatically result in higher margins. 
We will continue to increase investments 
in R&D, product management and sales 
capability. Taking this into account, 
as well as the increased costs of 
raw materials, the Board is confident 
of continued progression and its 
expectations for the financial year 
of 2017/18 remain unchanged.
