 Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 06
I am pleased to report a very successful year of 
strong sales and earnings growth and significant 
progress in the development of our business, with the 
commissioning of our largest ever capital investment 
project and the creation of an important strategic 
partnership with Nike.
2017 performance
Group sales grew 22% to £70.15m (2016: £57 .38m)  
and profit before tax and exceptional item also grew 
22% to £8.81m (2016: £7 .23m). Earnings per share 
before exceptional item rose 17% from 13.69p to 
16.04p. Profit before tax increased by 8% to £7 .55m 
(2016: £6.99m) and earnings per share was up 3%  
to 13.70p (2016: 13.25p). 
All business segments reported strong sales growth 
and our pipeline of commercial opportunities 
developed positively throughout the year. We have 
continued to invest in product and market development 
as well as the governance structure to support an 
increasingly international, high-growth business. 
Investments
The first phase of investment, HP1, at our site 
in Kentucky, USA has now been successfully 
commissioned, increasing Group high-pressure 
autoclave capacity by over 20%. Further capacity 
investment, this time in low-pressure autoclaves and 
infrastructure, at a cost of £12m, was approved during 
2017 for our Croydon, UK site, primarily for expansion 
of our ZOTEK
®
 range of HPP foams. 
The Board has also assessed a number of additional 
capacity options. It has decided, as a first step, to 
proceed with the installation of a second high-pressure 
autoclave (HP2) at our site in Kentucky at a cost of 
some $9m, which also includes a supporting extrusion 
line. The investment should deliver similar incremental 
capacity to HP1 and is expected to be commissioned 
in late 2019. 
An introduction from our Chairman

This is an exciting time for Zotefoams. We have a 
strong portfolio of differentiated products and growth 
opportunities and we will continue to invest in capacity 
to enable these to be delivered. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 4.02p per 
ordinary share (2016: 3.90p) which, if approved by 
shareholders, would make a total of 5.93p per ordinary 
share for the year (2016: 5.75p), an increase of 3.1%. 
This reflects the Board’s continued confidence in the 
Group’s future and is in line with the targeted policy of 
paying a progressive dividend. If approved, the final 
dividend will be paid on 24 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register on 20 April 2018. 
Board changes and governance
In August 2017 the Board appointed Doug Robertson 
as a Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit 
Committee. Doug succeeded Marie-Louise Clayton, 
who retired from the Board on 30 September 2017 
and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank her 
for her contribution both as Non-Executive Director 
and Audit Committee Chair during the six years 
that she served on the Board. After 10 years on the 
Board Richard Clowes will be retiring at the AGM on 
16 May 2018 and, to prepare for this, on 2 January 
2018 Jonathan Carling joined the Board as a Non-
Executive Director. I would like to express my thanks 
to Richard for his guidance and significant contribution 
to the Board throughout his tenure. We are pleased 
to announce that Doug Robertson will be replacing 
Richard as the Senior Independent Director upon his 
departure. We have a refreshed Board with a good 
balance of experience to challenge, guide and support 
the Executives in the delivery of our strategy. 
The Board considers that it has fully applied all of 
the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during 2017 . More information  
is provided in the Corporate Governance report. 
People
Zotefoams relies on the skills, effort and dedication of 
our people and ensuring that we have the right people 
and talent for the future needs of our business is 
critical. I would like to welcome those who have joined 
during the past twelve months and extend my thanks 
to each and every one of our hard-working employees 
who have made 2017 a very successful year.

Chairman
