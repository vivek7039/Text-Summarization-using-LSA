Annual  
Report on  
Remuneration
The Annual Report on Remuneration describes 
how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (“The 
Policy”), approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting in July 2015, has been applied 
in the financial year ended 31 March 2017, 
and how it will be applied in the financial year 
commenced 1 April 2017.
During the course of 2016/17, the 
Remuneration Committee was engaged in a 
number of key matters, including:
 — Determining salary increases for the 
Executive Directors and Executive Committee 
members, together with the overall level of 
salary increases for employees across  
the Group
 — Setting and subsequently reviewing the 
outcomes for corporate, business unit and 
personal targets under the annual bonus 
scheme for Executive Directors and Executive 
Committee members

1. Basic salary is stated as a per annum figure based on current annual salary at the end of 2016/17. Actual salaries paid in the year were £766,156 (Robert Noel) and £498,724  
(Martin Greenslade) .
2. Benefits consist of a car allowance, private medical insurance, income protection and life assurance premiums.
3. The pension allowance shown is a cash emolument of 25% of base salary. 
4. The annual bonus for 2015/16 was estimated in last year’s report and therefore the amounts for the bonus deferred into shares have been adjusted to reflect actual values. The impact of  
the adjustment was a reduction of £3,527 for Robert Noel and a reduction of £2,296 for Martin Greenslade.
5. The long-term incentives for 2016/17 have been calculated using a share price of £10.35 (which is the three-month average to 31 March 2017) . The long-term incentives vesting in 2015/16  
were estimated in last year’s report, so have been adjusted to reflect actual values. The impact of the adjustment was a reduction of £31,076 for Robert Noel and a reduction of £21,021  
for Martin Greenslade.

1.   Remuneration outcomes for Directors during the year
In this section, we explain the pay outcomes for Directors in relation to the financial year ended 31 March 2017. Table 47 shows the payments we expect 
to make and then tables 49 and 50 give more detail on how we have measured the performance outcomes with respect to the annual bonus and LTIP 
in the context of value created for shareholders.
1.1 Directors’ emoluments (Audited)
The basis of disclosure in the table below is on an ‘accruals’ basis. This means that the annual bonus column includes the amount that will be paid 
in June 2017 in connection with performance achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2017. It should be noted that the annual bonus figure 
has been estimated for the purposes of the table, as final data on the Company’s Total Property Return versus the peer group using the benchmark 
(i.e. all March-valued properties) will not be available until after the date of this report’s publication. The estimate has been derived from the most up-
to-date performance information available, and any payment made will be based on the final performance data when received and verified. 
The values shown for the 2014 LTIP awards vesting for the three year performance period ended 31 March 2017 are based on estimated 
achievements against the performance measures and calculated using the average share price for the quarter then ended. The actual share price is  
not known at the time of writing as the awards do not formally vest until July 2017. 
 — Monitoring Directors’ compliance with the 
Company’s share ownership guidelines
 — Monitoring developments in stakeholder 
sentiment on executive pay and corporate 
governance more generally, including 
participating in consultation exercises  
where appropriate.

1.2 Annual bonus outturn
In the year under review, each Executive Director had the potential to receive a maximum annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary. Of this, 130% was 
dependent on meeting Group targets and 20% dependent on meeting personal targets. All targets were set at the beginning of the year. The following 
table confirms the targets and their respective outcomes. The on-target bonus expectation is 75% of salary.

Key business targets
Development lettings – specific targets were set for both 
the London and Retail portfolios, with a focus on the 
London developments and Westgate Oxford (opening 
in 2017) and the extension of White Rose, Leeds. Net 
effective, rather than headline, rents were used as the 
key measure of performance. 
18.2 — The outturn is calculated on the basis of a threshold of £23.4m, and a 
maximum of £34.0m 
 — Both the Retail lettings targets, at Oxford and Leeds, were exceeded, 
while London lettings achieved threshold levels. £28m was achieved  
in total.
 — This element of the bonus therefore paid out at 66.4% of the maximum.
12.1
Residential sales – specific targets were set for the 
Victoria residential developments.
4.2 — The outturn is calculated on the basis of a threshold of £65m. 
Achievement is calculated on a straight-line basis from threshold to the 
maximum of £102m
 — The Group secured relevant sales of £51m, which was below threshold
 — This element of the bonus therefore was not paid.
0.0
Project budgets – specific aggregate and individual 
budget targets were set for projects in both London and 
Retail (Nova, New Street Square, 20 Eastbourne Terrace 
and White Rose).
6.2 — Although three out of four of the named developments were completed 
to target budgets, one (Nova) was not
 — This element of the bonus therefore was not paid.
0.0
Customers – recognising the importance of creating a 
truly customer-focused culture, specific targets were 
set around the rollout of internal and external customer 
excellence programmes. An improvement to (already 
high) customer satisfaction scores was also sought.
7.8 — The proposed rollout of the internal customer excellence programme was 
delayed to coincide with the launch of the new Landsec brand in June 
 — However, a programme of external customer engagement activities has 
been delivered, and customer satisfaction scores in London and Retail 
were maintained
 — This element of the bonus therefore paid out at 66.6% of the maximum.
5.2
People – ensuring that the office move to Victoria was 
maximised as an opportunity to embed the purpose, 
vision and values and create a step change in a more 
collaborative and innovative culture, to be measured 
through movement in “before” and “after” employee 
surveys versus a recognised external benchmark.
5.2 — The relevant survey scores improved by 35%
 — This element of the bonus therefore paid out in full.

initiatives in the most energy-intensive sites. 
5.2 — In order to achieve maximum payout, three levels of sustainability 
training, including a core mandatory module completed by at least 95% 
of employees, needed to be delivered. In addition, quantifiable energy 
reduction initiatives should be identified for implementation in two thirds 
of our most energy-intensive sites
 — The target on training was achieved in full, and energy reduction 
initiatives were identified in 88% of energy-intensive sites

1.3 Long-Term Incentive Plan and Matching Share Plan outturns
The table below summarises how we have assessed our LTIP performance achievement over the three years to 31 March 2017. Awards granted in 2014 
under the LTIP for this period are subject to performance conditions that measure and compare the Group’s relative performance against its peers in 
terms of Total Property Return (TPR) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR), with each measure representing 50% of the total award. Please see table 61 
for more detail on how vesting levels are determined. 
The performance calculation for awards granted in 2014 and vesting in 2017 are illustrated below:

For awards granted in 2015, the Group’s performance over the two years to 31 March 2017 would, if sustained over the three year period to  
31 March 2018, result in 0% of the LTIP share awards vesting. For awards granted in 2016, performance over the one year period to 31 March 2017  
would, if sustained over the second and third years of the period to 31 March 2019, result in 22.4% of the LTIP share awards vesting. Governance

3. Application of Policy for 2016/17
3.1  Executive Directors’ base salaries
Having conducted a detailed benchmarking exercise of both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer roles in 2015, the Committee 
concluded that no formal exercise was necessary this year, in line with emerging best practice. It has therefore awarded both Executive Directors a base 
salary increase of 2%. This is in line with the average increase received by employees across the Group, excluding promotions and exceptional increases. 
Accordingly, the following salary increases will take effect from 1 June 2017:

The fees for Non-executive Directors were reviewed In December 2015 following a market benchmarking exercise, and took effect from 1 April 2016.  
They have remained unchanged for 2016/17. When Nicholas Cadbury was appointed to the Board on 1 January 2017, he received the published base  
fee of £70,000 per annum.

4. Comparison of Chief Executive pay to Total Shareholder Return
The following graph illustrates the performance of the Company measured by Total Shareholder Return (share price growth plus dividends paid) against 
a ‘broad equity market index’ over a period of eight years. As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, this is considered to be 
the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graph. An additional line to illustrate the Company’s performance compared with the FTSE 100 
Index over the previous eight years is also included.
Adjacent to this chart is a table showing how the ‘single figure’ of total remuneration for the Chief Executive has moved over the same period. 
It should be noted that Robert Noel became Chief Executive in March 2012.

5. The context of pay in Landsec
5.1  Pay across the Group
a. Senior Management
During the year under review, bonuses (including discretionary bonuses) for our 16 most senior employees (excluding the Executive Directors) ranged 
from 37.6% to 74.5% of salary (2016: 40.1% to 114.2%). The average bonus was 55.6% of salary (2016: 67.0%). The LTIP and MSP awards made to Senior 
Management vested on the same basis as the awards made to Executive Directors.
b. All other employees
The average pay increase for all employees, including the Executive Directors, was 2.0%. Including salary adjustments and promotions for employees 
below the Board, this rose to 2.4%. The ratio of the salary of the Chief Executive to the average salary across the Group (excluding Directors) was  
13:1 (£768,668:£58,683).

2. See note 11 to the financial statements.
6. Dilution
Awards granted under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements, which cover those made under the LTIP , MSP , Deferred Share Bonus Plan and 
the Executive Share Option Plan are satisfied through the funding of an Employee Benefit Trust (administered by an external trustee) which acquires 
existing Land Securities Group PLC shares in the market. The Employee Benefit Trust held 792,556 shares at 31 March 2017.
The exercise of share options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all employees who have completed more than one 
month’s service with the Group, can be satisfied by the allotment of newly issued shares. At 31 March 2017, the total number of shares which could be 
allotted under this Scheme was 354,783 shares, which represents significantly less than 1% of the issued share capital of the Company.
7. Remuneration Committee meetings
The Committee met four times over the course of the year, and all of the members attended all meetings. Simon Palley chaired the Committee, and 
the other members during the year were Dame Alison Carnwath, Edward Bonham Carter and Cressida Hogg. The Committee meetings were also 
attended by the Chief Executive, the Group Human Resources Director, and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who acted as the 
Committee’s Secretary.
Over the course of the year, the Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary legal matters from Aon Hewitt. It has also made use 
of various published surveys to help determine appropriate remuneration levels and relied on information and advice provided by the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director. Aon Hewitt has voluntarily signed up to the Remuneration Consultants 
Group Code of Conduct. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. Aside from some support in benchmarking 
roles below the Board for pay review purposes, Aon Hewitt has no other connection with the Group. For the financial year under review, it received fees 
of £76,290 in connection with its work for the Committee.
