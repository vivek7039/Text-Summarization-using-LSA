Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
Significant  
growth globally
The Group’s strong performance  
reflects the continuation of  
our proven strategy. 
Ross Graham
Chairman 07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
I am delighted to report another excellent 
performance, with the Group having 
delivered significant revenue growth,  
whilst maintaining margins, to achieve  
a 55% increase in adjusted profit before  
tax to €23.0m in the year (2016: €14.9m). 
The Group’s strong performance reflects  
the continuation of our proven strategy  
to supplement strong organic growth with 
acquisitions that further extend the Group’s 
services and geographical reach to position 
us as the leading creative and technical 
services provider to the global video games 
industry. We made eleven acquisitions during 
the year, including two of our largest to date, 
VMC and Sperasoft. These acquisitions have 
enabled us to form a new Engineering service 
line of scale, add co-development expertise, 
expand the capacity of and capabilities  
within our existing service lines considerably 
and extend our geographical reach into 
Eastern Europe. 
In addition, we have invested in expanding 
capacity at many of our studios including 
Montreal, Zhengzhou, Manila, Dublin, Madrid 
and Tokyo during the year with further 
investments in expansion planned for 2018. 
Managing and funding growth
Part of the success of the Group can be 
attributed to the ability of the management 
team to source, execute and integrate 
acquisitions effectively across the globe  
and across our service lines whilst retaining 
the Keywords culture, which is a particular 
competency the team has built since IPO. 
That this has been accomplished across  
all of our service lines, now embracing  
over 40 studios in 20 countries, during  
2017 is a notable achievement. 
During the year, we raised £75m via a  
placing (before expenses), which was very 
well subscribed and we would like to thank 
our shareholders for their continued support. 
Since the year end, we have agreed terms  
for a new bank facility, initially for €75m over  
a three-year term with the option to extend 
the facility to €105m and by a further two 
years. The new facility replaces the existing 
€35m facility and is on improved terms. 
Together with our strong cash generation  
(the Group finished 2017 with €11.1m of  
net cash) this gives us further headroom  
to make acquisitions.
We are very comfortable with this level of 
debt, given that a high proportion of the 
Group’s revenues can be predicted with 
some certainty, and seek to maintain a  
mix of funding for our growth strategy  
which both gives us the flexibility to  
act on our investment decisions and 
enhances shareholder value. 
People and Board
The Group’s progress is a great credit to 
every single Keywords person who has 
helped make it happen. During the year  
our CEO, Andrew Day, was accorded the 
honour of being voted as CEO of the year  
at the Grant Thornton Quoted Company 
Awards 2018, a much-deserved tribute for 
someone who has been the very essence  
of Keywords – its dynamism, client focus  
and culture – but the award is also a tribute  
to the whole Keywords team.
I would like to thank my fellow Directors, 
whose complement has been strengthened 
by the appointments of Charlotta Ginman 
and Georges Fornay during the year. Both 
have added their own strengths to the  
Board, which benefits from a diversity of 
views in its highly constructive discussions 
which I believe ensures the Board operates 
effectively, to the benefit of the Group  
as it grows. Charlotta brings with her 
extensive investment banking, technology 
and mobile industry and PLC experience 
whilst Georges brings with him strong  
video games industry expertise.
I would also like to thank the senior 
management team and all the hard-working 
employees within the Group. There is a 
tremendous spirit within the businesses which 
makes Keywords a success, with a culture of 
continuous improvement which encourages 
everyone to make their own contributions 
towards consistently ensuring we provide  
the best service possible to our clients. 
Dividend
In line with our progressive dividend policy, 
and allowing for the need to retain resources 
to fund future growth of the Group’s business 
and its strategic aims, the Board is pleased  
to recommend a final dividend of 0.98p  
per share which, following the interim 
dividend payment of 0.48p per share,  
will make the total dividend for the year 
ending 31 December 2017 1.46p per share, 
an increase of 10% compared to 2016. 
Summary and outlook
Following a highly successful 2017, we 
entered 2018 with pro forma revenues of 
€225m derived from a more diversified, 
better balanced business with an expanded 
range of services and locations that will 
support our aim to increasingly become  
a key strategic partner to the major  
games companies.
It is a pleasure to Chair a Group which has  
a strong business model that supports 
profitable growth and high cash conversion, 
where the strategic aims are clearly defined, 
and that serves an industry which is growing 
fast in which we can increase our share by 
offering an expanding array of services. 
The Keywords team remains highly focussed 
on delivering the high standard of work we 
have come to be known for and maintaining 
the trust and confidence of our clients as  
we grow both organically and by acquisition.  
I am, therefore, confident that the Group will 
make further progress as it continues to build 
upon its strengthened services platform with 
considerable scope for further growth.
