Chairman’s Statement
Strategic Report
 
I am delighted to be reporting to you as the newly appointed Chairman 
of Dixons Carphone plc. It is great to be back at a business I served for 
more than a decade. Importantly, I would like to pay tribute to the 
achievements of my predecessor, Sir Charles Dunstone, one of the UK’s 
great entrepreneurs, who founded half of this business that has gone on 
to be one of the world’s major retailers, serving millions of customers 
every year in 10 countries and employing more than 43,000 people.
It has been a remarkable and sometimes challenging year. 
In the days after the referendum on the UK’s membership of 
the EU, the Company’s share price fell by as much as 34%, 
as retailers were considered vulnerable to a post Brexit 
slowdown. In this environment and despite the uncertainty, 
the team got on with their job of making the business 
stronger by serving our customers better. 
In the UK & Ireland our new 3-in-1 stores bring together 
Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse in an exciting 
shopping environment and we are very pleased with the 
initial results of these stores. We have also improved 
our online capabilities, particularly with a new Carphone 
Warehouse web platform and we have experienced strong 
online sales growth across all our brands. 
And it’s not just about great products. Team Knowhow, our 
new services brand, is piloting a range of expanded services 
in the Leeds and London conurbations. We think that this 
support will be ever more important to help customers 
to get the best from the amazing world which modern 
technology can offer. 
We also have become an important centre to help 
customers choose the best providers of other services. 
We successfully integrated Simplifydigital into the Group 
and both in store and online made switching your energy, 
broadband or TV service easy. Go to one of our stores and 
try our 30 second challenge to save you money!
In the Nordic region, our expanded distribution centre in 
Jönköping, Sweden, one of the largest in Northern Europe, 
was completed to time and on budget with its own railway 
station inside the centre. It distributes across the Nordics 
and we expect to see benefits in stock availability and 
efficiency. 
We continue to gain market share across our businesses. 
A particular mention should be made of Kotsovolos in 
Greece which further enhanced its position as market leader 
with 3ppts market share growth against a clearly difficult 
economic environment.
The hard work of all our people and the management team 
led by Seb – and a huge thank you to all of them - have 
helped deliver a 10% growth in headline profit before tax 
on 9% higher revenue with total profit before tax increasing 
£123 million. This is an excellent achievement at a time 
when many retailers are struggling. This has allowed 
the Company to announce a dividend of 7.75 pence per 
share for the full year, an increase of 19%, to be paid on 
22 September 2017. 5 Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17
 
Strategic Report
In business, it is not just what a company does but how it 
does it that matters and we are proud of our contribution 
to the societies in which we operate. Our relationship with 
our key stakeholders and the way we manage the business 
in a sustainable manner are set out in our Corporate 
Responsibility Statement on pages 28 to 35. We believe 
that our unique expertise in technology can be used to 
help tackle social issues and we are hugely supportive 
of our colleagues’ roles in contributing to good causes. 
Dixons Carphone is proud to be a founding partner of 
Heads Together, which seeks to support those with mental 
health issues. We are also a Charity Partner of the Mix 
which supports the physical and mental wellbeing of young 
people. This was recognised when Dixons Carphone were 
shortlisted for Charity Partnership of the Year.
The future holds many opportunities and a few challenges 
and uncertainties. But we are well positioned. We have 
invested to make our stores best in class. We are market 
leaders in our key markets. We believe that the future 
will become more connected and more complicated. 
Customers will choose and buy through a mix of online 
and offline. We will be there with them providing technical 
knowhow and unbiased independent advice together with 
the ever important great prices, excellent service and great 
choice. Our job is to provide great value for customers and 
shareholders alike. 
Finally I would like to take this opportunity to express 
my thanks to not only Sir Charles but also Tim How and 
Baroness Sally Morgan who will both be stepping down 
from the Board following the 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
Tim and Sally have been long-serving members of the Board 
and have provided invaluable support and guidance during 
their terms. I wish them both all the very best in their future 
activities. I am also pleased to welcome Fiona McBain to 
the Board; Fiona’s business leadership, in particular in the 
financial services sector, will be a great asset as we evolve 
our consumer services propositions.
