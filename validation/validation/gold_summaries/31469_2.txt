Highlights and contents
Front cover:
G4S provides technology and physical security services for the three consortia building the 
Thames Tideway tunnel. G4S is securing the project as a fully-integrated partner for security 
across all 21 construction worksites.
The Thames Tideway tunnel is a £4.2 billion construction project, designed to stop London’s 
iconic River Thames from being polluted. A cleaner Thames and a more attractive riverside will 
help underpin London’s economic prosperity, attracting more tourists, and boosting the use of 
river transport. It is also expected to help revitalise small local businesses and the commercial 
fishing industry, by encouraging healthy marine life.
