Introduction 
2017 has seen strong progress for Lightwave, with advances in, technology, products, marketing, sales and 
distribution. 
 
Technology and Products   
We design and develop hardware devices and software. Our range of almost 100 smart home devices now includes 
the recently launched Generation 2 which is also a part of the Apple HomeKit offering. Manufacturing is outsourced 
to Asia and mainland Europe. Platform hosting is with cloud based operators. We have continued to grow our 
technology team and intend to bring in more talent as we invest in the further product development necessary to 
scale the Company. 
 
As well as completing the development of the Generation 2 technology, launched just a few weeks ago, we also 
completed significant enhancements to our cloud-based platform. This included integration with Google Assistant 
voice control for the Google Home device. Consumer uptake of our Amazon Alexa integration has continued with over 
8,000 Lightwave customers now using our Amazon Alexa “Skill” for voice control. 
 
We have filed a series of patent applications to provide protection to our technology and plan further filings of new 
developments. 
 
Marketing  
Our marketing uses consumer oriented messages such as “Your Home. Smarter”. We recently launched a new website 
under the brand “Lightwave”. In addition to product description and guides, the website now offers full online 
ordering. We are now using various digital marketing techniques to generate direct sales demand, build market 
awareness and develop the Lightwave brand. This is supported by media relations programmes to secure coverage in 
both specialist and generalist outlets.   
 
Sales and Distribution 
We sell both our Generation 1 and 2 devices primarily through distribution partners. We have recently added Exertis 
as a distributor to enable us to supply Apple, who are retailing our Generation 2 devices both online and in UK and 
UAE stores. We will continue to develop our distribution strategy to ensure we market our devices effectively and 
generate increasing demand.   
 
A growing proportion of our sales are being made directly to consumers. As well as providing another route to market 
this has significant benefit for us to fully understand the customer experience and to be able to directly tap in to their 
feedback.

 2017 Results 
The revenues for the year more than doubled to £3.03 million (2016: £1.44 million) through further stocking by our 
distributors and direct consumer sales. Gross profit also more than doubled to £1.08 million (2016: £0.47 million) in 
line with the increase in revenue. Gross margin rose to 35.5% (2016: 32.5%) with direct consumer sales starting to 
make a material contribution. We recognise the scope to improve margins as we scale operations. Administrative 
expenses increased to £2.12 million (2016: £1.49 million) as the Group invested further in sales, marketing, research 
and development. Capitalised development costs under IAS38 increased to £0.69 million (2016: £0.51 million) driven 
mostly by the investment in our Generation 2 technology. As anticipated, the amortisation of intangible assets 
increased substantially to £0.3 million (2016: £0.1 million) in line with our policy of amortising as projects reach 
completion. 
 
Research and development tax credits of £0.25 million (2016: £0.21 million) were recognised as other income before 
stated pre and post tax losses of £0.85 million (2016: £0.84 million). As we achieve financial progress through our 
increased revenue and gross profit, we  plan to invest more in technology and marketing for the medium to longer 
term. Our distributor order book, which at 30 November 2017 month end exceeded £700,000 at current exchange 
rates. As the smart home market becomes faster moving, we are seeing shorter lead times for orders and direct 
consumer sales have no order component. 
 
Cash absorbed from operations increased to £0.89 million (2016: £0.63 million) with inventories up in support of our 
direct consumer sales activity. Cash invested, mostly in the development of our technology increased to £0.72 million 
(2016 £0.52 million). Cash balances at 30 September 2017 were £220,000 (2016: £2,000) even as we approached the 
conclusion of the programme to launch Generation 2 into Apple HomeKit. 
 
The year end balance sheet saw shareholders’ equity much improved to £1.22 million (2016: deficit £0.17 million) 
after the December 2016 fundraising of £2.2 million met the cash outflow from operating losses and the continued 
investment in technology. Long and short term loans and borrowings were substantially reduced to £0.59 million 
(2016: £0.99 million).

Strategy 
We continue to believe there is an opportunity for a UK Company that offers a wide and deep range of integrated 
smart home solutions to achieve significant scale. The competitive environment remains broadly the same as it has 
done for some time, in that gadgets, single device and single market segment solutions prevail, while we offer a 
distinctive, stylish and affordable smart home experience. During 2018 we will focus on the following key steps: 
• Undertaking a rolling launch of a comprehensive range of new Generation 2 devices, from early 2018;
• Enhancing our recently redesigned app to give our customers increasing capabilities for the coordination and
control of their smart home;
• Broadening our cloud platform capabilities with further integration and interoperability features for non-
Lightwave devices and software;
• Continue building our marketing function and increase investment to build our brand, utilising product and
customer focused approaches;
• Expand our direct sales function, introducing a field based home visit sales team;
• Add further distributors that complement and extend our distribution capability;
• Launching an international device range, following an indication from Apple that they are actively considering
offering our Generation 2 sockets and switches to their online and retail customer base in 25 European countries.
Outlook 
2017 has been a pivotal year for the Group. Having launched Generation 2 devices into the market we are now moving 
to pursue our goal of creating a scaled Company able to compete with the major brands in the smart home market.  
In 2018 we will move to strengthen our management team in marketing, sales and technology, enhancing the talented 
group which has achieved considerable progress to date. We recognise the ability to retain and attract suitably 
qualified and experienced staff will be critical to our success and growth. 
Consumer awareness and understanding of the benefits of smart home technology continues to rise, and our market 
opportunity is increasingly large. Our relationship with Apple is a significant asset that supports our growth in the UK 
and which should also allow us to enter international markets efficiently. We look forward to building a great company 
in the rapidly growing smart home market.
