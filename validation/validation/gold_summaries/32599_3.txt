Chairman’s Statement
T oday’s Business is Built on a Proud Heritage
The Group’s shares were first admitted 
to trading on AIM on 5 May 2016.
The Company has achieved the main 
strategic objectives which were set 
by the Board at the time of the Initial 
Public Offering (IPO), namely the 
implementation of the Morses Club 
Card and the purchase of Shelby 
Finance Limited, whose online system 
has been used as the platform for the 
recent launch of our online lending 
product trading as Dot Dot Loans. As a 
result of these investments, the Group 
has continued to grow both its revenue, 
by 10% and adjusted profit by 5% to 
£99.6m and £17 .7m respectively. 
Reported PBT grew by 8% to £11.2m.
