 ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 10
Following the strong performance in the 
year ended 30 July 2016, I am very pleased 
to report further growth across the 
business for the year ended 29 July 2017, 
despite challenging economic conditions.
Financial and strategic objectives
The Group continues to pursue the 
following objectives:
• Deliver profitable and sustainable 
growth;
• Improve the quality of earnings; 
• Improve business resilience through  
the economic cycle; and
• Increase shareholder returns.
The business has continued to deliver 
against these objectives, growing revenue 
and gross profit, diligently controlling 
costs and maximising cash flow. I am 
particularly pleased with this result given 
the toughening trading environment  
since the turn of the year, and believe it 
demonstrates the increasingly resilient 
business we are building and the 
commitment of our Board and staff  
to achieving the objectives we set.
A clear strategy for 
growth, underpinned  
by strong cash flows and 
increasing resilience
Chairman’s Statement
Reaching the milestone of 100 ScS stores 
was a further highlight of this financial 
year, with our new stores in Aberdeen, 
Thanet, Edinburgh (Straiton) and Plymouth 
contributing towards the increase in 
revenue, gross profit and EBITDA. These 
stores will help the Group continue to 
target sustainable growth and improve  
the overall resilience of the business.
Result and dividend
I am pleased to report that the Group 
delivered a result slightly ahead of market 
expectations. The first half of the financial 
year saw the Group trade strongly and 
continue the momentum from the previous 
financial year. However, as we noted in  
our trading outlook in March, the second 
half of the year brought with it more 
challenging conditions across the market, 
with decreased footfall and reduced 
consumer confidence. Against this 
backdrop, and very strong prior year 
comparatives, I am proud of our two-year 
like-for-like order intake growth of 14.3%. 
We have also continued to identify and 
implement various business efficiencies, 
which have helped to increase our EBITDA 
margin and resulted in a 7.8% increase  
in earnings per share (EPS) from 21.8p  
to 23.5p.
The Group continues to hold no debt, had 
cash reserves of £40.1m at 29 July 2017 
and generated free cash flows in the year  
of £23.6m, benefiting from a £12.5m 
working capital movement. Underlying 
cash flows, together with continued 
expansion in our store network, show the 
Group’s ability to continue to grow and 
strengthen its balance sheet. The Group 
continues to maintain a £12.0m committed 
revolving credit facility. This provides 
further resilience, whilst also allowing  
the Group to maximise opportunities  
as they arise. 
Despite the continued uncertain economic 
environment, the improved operating 
results year-on-year, the strength of the 
Group’s balance sheet and the Board’s 
confidence in the outlook for the Group 
has resulted in the Board proposing  
a full-year dividend of 14.70p, a 1.4% 
increase on the full-year dividend for 2016. 
If approved, this would result in a final 
dividend of 9.80p. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 11

Final thoughts
Finally, I would like to record the Board’s 
thanks to all of our 1,952 team members 
throughout the business. Particularly 
against more challenging trading 
conditions, it is their commitment, 
expertise and enthusiasm that allows the 
Group to continue to grow and improve 
each year, and deliver our mission to 
provide our customers with excellent 
service, value and quality.
The Group has a clear strategy for growth, 
underpinned by strong cash flows and the 
increasing resilience of the Group’s balance 
sheet. The Group is positioned to take 
advantage of future opportunities and 
whilst there remains a level of uncertainty 
in the wider economy, the Board remains 
positive about the long-term prospects  
for the business.
