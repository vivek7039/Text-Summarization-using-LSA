14 Performance
I am delighted to report record levels of revenue and 
profit for the year to 31 March 2017 . Pre-tax profits 
continued to increase, reaching £34.1 million (2016: 
£32.2 million), slightly ahead of the level anticipated at 
the beginning of the year due to more open market 
completions in the second half of the year and 
additional build to rent profit recognition. The gross 
margin before interest charges of 22.3 per cent and the 
operating margin before interest of 13.4 per cent were 
in line with expectations. Both reflect the increasing 
mix between developments sold to individual buyers 
and build to rent transactions secured at lower margins 
in exchange for enhanced capital returns.
Despite uncertainty in relation to the outcome of the 
EU referendum and tax changes impacting primarily 
UK based individual investors, our underlying market 
has remained resilient. Any potential dampening effect 
of these factors has been outweighed by the structural 
imbalance between supply and need for new homes 
in London, particularly at our typical price point.
'In addition to strong financial results for the year to  
31 March 2017, our growing reputation as a build to rent 
partner is unlocking an exciting source of future growth.'

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
DEVELOPING IN LONDON:  
A POSITIVE OUTLOOK
Our forward selling strategy continues to be at 
the heart of our model. We sell homes early in the 
development cycle as a means of de-risking projects 
and advancing investment into new opportunities. 
This means that trading activity undertaken in each 
financial year will typically deliver revenue and profit 
over the following two to three years, giving the 
Board substantial visibility over future profit levels 
and expected cash flows. We receive deposits when 
contracts are exchanged for individual properties 
and, as at 31 March 2017, £68.1 million of deposits 
had been taken in advance of future completions. 
This additional funding supports further investment 
in the development pipeline and reduces the need to 
draw down debt finance. We start the financial year 
with a substantial order book of forward sales of 
£546 million (1 April 2016: £579 million). This secure 
and de-risked position is underpinning our stated 
expectations for growth over the next few years.
Following some recent land acquisitions, our 
development pipeline stands at £1.5 billion of future 
revenue and represents more than five times the 
revenue generated in the year to 31 March 2017. The 
average anticipated price of the open market homes 
within the pipeline is £527,000 (2016: £513,000). 
This is in line with our model of seeking non-prime 
opportunities where the average sales price is below 
£1,000 per square foot, and hence the majority of 
homes are priced between £350,000 and £700,000.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
In February 2017, we added to the pipeline with 
the acquisition of a sizeable development site, the 
former London Electricity Board (LEB) building on 
Cambridge Heath Road, E2 for £30.2 million. The 
anticipated gross development value of the site is 
approximately £95.0 million. Subject to planning 
consent, we expect to start work on site in 2018 and 
to finish in 2021. Post year end we have exchanged 
contracts to acquire Stone Studios in Hackney 
Wick for 120 homes plus commercial space, and 
have been selected as the preferred partner of the 
London Borough of Brent to develop 236 homes in 
South Kilburn. Both sites have full planning consent 
and we expect to start on site later this year.
Customer mix
The Group’s customer mix for the year to 31 March 
2017 has moved significantly towards institutional 
build to rent investors, with this sector representing 
77 per cent of sales generated (2016: 24 per cent) 
compared with individual investors from the UK and 
overseas at 20 per cent (2016: 69 per cent) and 
owner-occupiers at three per cent (2016: seven per 
cent). In total, including build to rent transactions, 
we exchanged contracts for the sale of 501 open 
market properties in the year to 31 March 2017 
(2016: 463).

16 Individual open market sales
As our build to rent business has grown, and we 
have continued to pursue our forward sales strategy, 
we have naturally seen lower numbers of sales to 
owner-occupiers. Unless they are cash buyers, 
owner-occupiers are typically unable to purchase 
more than six months ahead of completion. 
However, there is clearly significant demand from 
this part of the market and over the last few weeks 
we have had a very encouraging response to the 
launch of the residual availability at Bermondsey 
Works leading to 22 owner-occupier reservations, 
20 of which are being purchased under the 
Government’s Help to Buy scheme.
We have seen robust demand from individual 
investors underpinned by a thriving rental market 
primarily caused by an imbalance between supply 
and demand for rental properties at the right price 
point. Amongst these sales it is pleasing to see 
a number of repeat purchasers, who often opt 
to wait for the launch of the next Telford Homes 
development rather than investing elsewhere. In 
the 2016 calendar year, we achieved a 99 per cent 
customer recommendation rate, an outstanding 
performance that sustains the high levels achieved 
in previous years (2015: 99 per cent).
Our last significant launch to individual investors was 
the second phase of City North, Finsbury Park, in 
November 2016, which secured 73 new sales for a 
combined value of over £43 million. The success of 
this is evidence that high quality homes in desirable 
locations remain sought after by investors across the 
world. Subsequent to City North, developments that 
could have been more widely launched for sale have 
instead been sold to build to rent investors as part of 
our new strategic focus. Notwithstanding this we are 
confident that there remains a healthy market for our 
typical product from individual buyers.
Build to rent
We have increased our presence in the London build 
to rent sector over the last year. Since February 2016 
we have entered into four build to rent transactions 
comprising of nearly 500 homes, together worth 
over £230 million. Telford Homes is a valued 
partner to large-scale investors, given our record in 
delivering complex residential projects, and we are 
proud to have become recognised as a significant 
build to rent developer in such a short space of time. 
In December 2016, we exchanged contracts for the 
sale of The Forge, Redclyffe Road, E6 to M&G Real 
Estate. The sale consisted of the freehold interest 
in the land and construction of 125 homes for a 
net consideration of £48.6 million. This was our 
third build to rent transaction, and the second with 
M&G. At the end of March 2017 our joint venture, 
Chobham Farm North LLP, exchanged contracts 
on our fourth significant build to rent transaction. 
Contracts were exchanged for the sale of 112 of the 
297 open market homes at New Garden Quarter, 
Stratford E15, for a net consideration of £53.7 
million. The sale, to a subsidiary of our joint venture 
partner Notting Hill Housing Group, was for the first 
phase of open market homes at this development 
and removed the need for third party debt finance.
As we have previously reported we are actively 
looking into establishing longer term relationships 
with build to rent investors. We anticipate that this 
type of partnership will enable Telford Homes to 
buy land with a secured build to rent sale already 
in place subject to any planning requirements. This 
will bring focus to our acquisition of build to rent 
opportunities, allowing us to move swiftly to secure 
sites and to take advantage of an increased desire 
for purpose built rental homes from local councils 
and the Mayor of London.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION Market context
The principal market developments in the year have 
been a level of nervousness created by the outcome 
of the EU referendum and tax changes, namely the 
three per cent stamp duty surcharge on second 
properties and the phased removal of tax relief on 
mortgage interest. The potentially negative impact of 
these factors on our performance has been mitigated 
by the chronic imbalance between the supply of 
and need for homes in London. Our business model 
of developing homes that people can afford to 
either buy or rent is built upon this fundamental and 
longstanding driver of demand.
Although the EU referendum result created a degree 
of uncertainty, this has not to date been a significant 
cause for concern for the Group. We chose to defer 
launches for a short period while the immediate 
furore died down, something that our focus on 
forward selling allows us the flexibility to do. Demand 
remained buoyant however and neither have we seen 
significant pressure on labour availability or materials 
due to the result, especially as there has not been a 
dramatic increase in the supply of homes in London. 
We will continue to monitor the negotiations with 
the EU, looking for stability throughout the process 
and assurances as soon as possible on the rights of 
EU workers to remain in the UK. We consider that 
these are already vital considerations for both sides, 
which supports our confidence in continuing with our 
current strategy for growth.
The shift of our business model towards build to 
rent has helped to cushion us from the impact of 
the tax changes. In any case sales to overseas 
investors have remained robust, evidenced by the 
launches of the Liberty Building just over a year 
ago and more recently City North. We have seen 
particular success over the last three years in selling 
to investors based in China. This is despite any 
potential tempering of demand in relation to leaving 
the EU or the additional three per cent stamp duty, 
both of which have been offset for some buyers by 
favourable movements in exchange rates.
We have, however, seen a reduction in the number 
of UK based individuals seeking to invest in buy-
to-let properties. These investors have been more 
sensitive than overseas buyers to the uncertainty 
resulting from the EU referendum, and have also 
been deterred by the increase in stamp duty and the 
reducing ability to benefit from tax relief on mortgage 
interest. Despite these tax changes the attractive 
rental yields that are bringing institutional investors 
into the market should also encourage individuals to 
invest again once their confidence returns.
Objectives and strategy
Our primary objective is to build more homes in 
London and to grow in a controlled manner to meet 
some of the shortfall between supply and need in the 
capital. We are on track to achieve our stated ambition 
to generate significant growth in pre-tax profits over 
the next two years, and also to create a platform for 
sustaining a bigger business that can continue to  
grow in the longer term.
Our strategic priority is to further increase our activity 
in the build to rent sector. Our business is very capital 
intensive and this restricts our rate of growth if we are 
relying on our own sources of capital. A key attraction 
of build to rent is that forward funded developments 
do not require much, if any, of our equity, nor any 
debt finance. This allows us to accelerate the growth 
of the business, provided we have the operational 
capacity to do so, and to combine that with reducing 
our longer term reliance on debt.
As well as the focus on increasing our presence in 
build to rent, we are expanding our geographical 
reach beyond our historical heartland of boroughs 
in the East of London. We still expect to operate 
in our key boroughs, but as the business grows 
in scale we are looking to broaden the spread of 
individual sale and build to rent opportunities. An 
example of this in action is the South Kilburn site in 
partnership with Brent, a borough in which we have 
not previously developed. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
18 We do not expect Help to Buy to become as 
fundamental to Telford Homes as it is to many other 
developers, but it will help us to maintain support for 
those who still wish to purchase their own home.
We are planning dedicated sales centres on more of our 
sites, working together with our central sales location in 
Stratford. In these instances, including at Bow Garden 
Square, St Pauls Way, E3 and the remainder of New 
Garden Quarter, we will be commencing sales much 
later in the development process than would normally 
be the case. We expect this to bring a healthy balance 
to our overall sales mix ensuring that we are able to 
flexibly adjust to any future demand changes across  
our various customer segments.
In the last 12 months we have taken a big step 
forward in terms of our commitment to sustainability. 
We now have a Head of Sustainability and a fully-
fledged strategy, ‘Building a Living Legacy’, including 
a commitment to achieving a range of targets over 
the next seven years. 
We believe our skillset can be deployed to develop 
homes across London, maintaining a strong pipeline 
of developments for individual buyers in non-prime 
locations and for build to rent investors.
Another decision that has resulted from our 
increased scale is to target larger sites, typically 
of 50 or more units, in order to secure economies 
of scale. This also fits with the minimum scale of 
investment for most build to rent investors and 
ensures we are not spending time on smaller sites 
that historically contribute much less to profits and 
disproportionately take up operational capacity.
Having a solid foundation of forward sold properties 
now allows us the flexibility to hold back some open 
market homes until later in the development time 
frame, should we wish to take advantage of an active 
owner-occupier market, supported in some instances 
by Help to Buy. We have seen recent success with 
Help to Buy at Bermondsey Works, having held back 
the residual availability with that objective.

KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION We anticipate that over the next few years build to 
rent could represent as much as half of our total 
revenue pipeline. 
The Board is comfortable with the development 
pipeline, and we have avoided acquiring land at 
inflated prices. We have equity and debt available 
to add to the pipeline, and will do this where 
opportunities are consistent with our strategy and 
meet our financial hurdles. Prospects spanning 
a variety of locations are being evaluated on an 
ongoing basis and in greater numbers than in 2016. 
This, together with the successful tenders for our 
recent acquisitions, is encouraging in terms of 
securing access to our most important raw material.
We are confident in our product and market place 
as we look to the future. Over 80 per cent of the 
anticipated gross profit for the year to 31 March 2018 
has been secured, and Telford Homes is on track to 
deliver over £40 million of profit before tax. In addition, 
for the year to 31 March 2019, we have secured over 
60 per cent of the anticipated gross profit and expect 
profit before tax to exceed £50 million.
The strength of our performance and outlook are 
testament to the hard work and commitment of 
everyone at Telford Homes. I am proud of our way  
of working, our exemplary rate of employee retention 
and our excellent health and safety record and all 
the more so in view of the exceptional growth we 
have achieved in the last few years. I want to thank 
everyone that makes Telford Homes a special place 
to work and I look forward to another exciting period 
of growth ahead.

These targets address economic, social and 
environmental aspects of building a sustainable 
business for the benefit of all our stakeholders.  
You can read more about this on page 38.
Ever mindful of needing to work as efficiently as 
possible, we have increased our adoption of modern 
methods of construction to speed up the delivery of 
certain developments, something the Government 
has been encouraging the sector to do. Not only is 
this beneficial to our customers and investors but 
it also improves our return on capital. Examples 
include the off-site construction of brick cladding at 
our Manhattan Plaza development and the use of a 
lightweight metal frame structure at The Pavilions, one 
of our build to rent schemes. Along with the rest of the 
industry, we will be looking at how we can increase 
the use of these methods and others to deliver homes 
more quickly and efficiently.
More detail on our strategy is available on page 12.
Outlook
We anticipate that the lack of supply of new homes 
relative to need in non-prime areas of London 
will continue to provide ample opportunity for the 
growth of Telford Homes in the foreseeable future. 
Our increased focus on build to rent, with de-risked 
sales requiring reduced levels of equity and no debt 
finance, allows us to evaluate ways to grow at a 
faster rate. Although build to rent projects generate a 
moderately lower net margin, our return on capital is 
much improved and longer term debt requirements 
will be lower.
We expect to continue our successes in the build to 
rent sector due to the increasing appetite of a range 
of potential investors. In particular, we will pursue 
longer term partnerships whilst also maintaining an 
awareness of other opportunities.
