2017: A STEP CHANGE FOR SCISYS 
TOWARDS ITS MEDIUM-TERM 
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
In last year’s report I expressed my confidence 
based on the progress achieved in 2016 that 
we would be able to continue our sustainable, 
resilient and balanced growth in 2017.
I am delighted to confirm that we have ended 
the period with record revenues of £57.2m (up 
25%), an adjusted operating profit of £4.6m 
(up 44%) and adjusted operating margin of 
8%. This is a step change in our performance 
and it brings us closer to our medium-term 
objectives of £60m in revenues and a double-
digit margin. Two major elements have 
contributed to this improved performance:
•  Annova, the Munich-based newsroom 
solutions specialist, has contributed its first 
full year to the Group’s results.
•  The other divisions have contributed a 
very healthy 9% organic revenue growth 
during 2017, based on a strong second half 
year, which is in line with our expectations 
expressed in September 2017.
Across all of our divisions we have seen major 
new contract wins, which in aggregate have 
lifted our order book to more than £91.3m – 
another record achieved in 2017. The sales 
success story was epitomised late in 2017 by 
the notable win by our Space division, which 
secured a contract worth €18m to deliver the 
complete ground-control infrastructure for the 
German Heinrich Hertz mission. 
Of this total order book value, £36.5m is for 
delivery in 2018. This underpins our optimistic 
outlook for the year ahead and strongly 
reinforces the confidence that our medium-
term objectives are within reach.
Enterprise Solutions & Defence (ESD) 
The ESD division delivered a strong second 
half, with its contribution up by 35% and 
revenues up by 9% on the first six months 
and thus making up for a slower first half. The 
division achieved robust overall results that 
were just short of its excellent accomplishment 
in 2016. It delivered full-year revenues of 
£16.5m and a contribution of £4.2m, equating 
to a margin of 25% for the division.
ESD has spent significant effort during the 
year preparing for further growth, including 
recruiting additional sales effort and new staff. 
These initiatives have begun bearing fruit, with 
the order intake exceeding £8m during the 
fourth quarter of 2017.
To maximise its potential for future growth 
the division has started to reorganise its 
internal structure to serve three focal units 
targeting specific sectors: Defence, Security 
and Maritime; Government and Emergency 
Services; and Commercial. 
 
All three business units have benefited from 
their respective healthy mix of recurring 
revenues and repeat business based on 
long-standing customer relationships, as 
well as new business wins in established or 
adjacent application domains. Contract types 
across ESD range from fixed-price contracts, 
managed budget contracts and time & 
materials-based contracts. During 2017, 
the division experienced a move towards a 
larger proportion of time & materials-based 
contracts (60%, compared with 47% in 2016), 
frequently delivering services at customer 
sites. This trend is expected to continue as 
clients increasingly move towards an agile 
project methodology. 
Activities in the Defence, Security and 
Maritime unit were dominated by ongoing 
projects for electronic architectures for 
vehicles and vessels, bespoke development 
of business systems and long-term on-
site time & materials contracts in the 
intelligence sector. In all of these realms, 
new opportunities evolved during the year 
through both new and established customer 
relationships. Some of these occurred in late 
2017, including: an extension of a research 
programme for the Royal Navy’s Maritime Air 
Defence Command; a new strategic project 
in the maritime defence area; and a newly 
established engagement with another major 
prime contractor for a large defence software 
and electronics programme.

business unit continued its frequently 
recurring long-term business with

customers such as London’s Metropolitan 
Police (the Met), The Coal Authority and the 
Environment Agency. Testament to these 
proven relationships, the Met awarded one 
of seven places on its Solution Provider 
Framework to our ESD division. In addition, 
the unit extended its reach by winning initial 
contracts with Defra, Public Health England 
and both parts of the newly re-organised 
Forestry Commission.
The Commercial business unit is well 
established and maintains a core of blue-
chip clients, including Vodafone, UK Power 
Networks, Siemens, Arqiva and Transport 
for London. During 2017 the unit renewed 
its focus on the transport and logistics 
sector. This saw a significant increase in its 
business with Siemens and the team secured 
initial contracts with Angel Trains and Govia 
Thameslink Railway. 
For some of these activities, ESD has 
benefited from joining forces with Xibis, a 
separate SCISYS PLC subsidiary based in 
Leicester, as illustrated by the joint delivery of 
an award-winning charting app to Imray.
On the technology and innovation front, 
significant effort has gone into reusable 
software platforms, including MACSYS 
for maritime applications and Cartosys for 
OpenGIS-based solutions. The sales team 
has positioned ESD on major framework 
contracts, which boosts the division’s 
opportunities going forward. Divisional 
management and their growing teams are 
settling into the new structure providing well-
grounded optimism for 2018 and beyond. 
Media & Broadcast (M&B)
In 2017 our M&B division once again 
delivered a strong performance, with 
revenues of £8.7m (up 9%) and a contribution 
of £2.6m (up 4%). With a margin of 30%, its 
more product-biased business model delivers 
a level of profitability ahead of the Group 
average. Much of the success was secured 
during an impressive upturn in the second 
half year, which was predicted and in line 
with the outlook given in our interim results 
(revenues and contribution up 46% and 162% 
respectively on the first half year, with margin 
up to 37% from 21%).
During 2017 the M&B division relied on its 
strong recurring revenues from maintenance 
contracts and repeat business from its long-
established customer base in Germany and 
the UK. This provided a sound foundation for 
its strong performance. 
In line with its growth objectives, the 
division also focused on opportunities in 
new territories. This led to an initial win for a 
radio pilot project with the Malaysian public 
broadcaster RTM. The ongoing project with 
the South African Broadcasting Corporation 
(SABC) successfully concluded the proof-of-
concept phase and moved into deployment 
despite experiencing some delays to roll-out 
due to organisational changes at SABC later 
in the year. The M&B division won its first 
client in France with commercial broadcaster 
RTL. This contract was signed in April and the 
first programme, RTL Fun Radio, successfully 
went live in November, followed swiftly by 
RTL2. 
DIGITAL MAPPING EXCELLENCE
An app by Xibis and SCISYS has won 
a ‘Commended Award’ from the British 
Cartographic Society for excellence in 
digital mapping. The project involved 
an international marine chart plotter for 
smartphones and iPads, for our client 
Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd.

The M&B team has worked to position 
the division for the medium-term future by 
further advancing its product innovation. 
The recent cloud-based products dira! 
More and dira! Scotty both went live in 
customer environments in 2017. dira! Medox 
is a cloud-friendly, SaaS-ready multimedia 
asset management solution. It was first 
presented to the public at the IBC convention 
in Amsterdam in September 2017 as the first 
member of the next major product generation 
called dira! Dimension, with positive 
feedback. 
The joining of forces with Annova has 
started to bear fruit. At the BBC, the 
software integration of Annova’s OpenMedia 
installation and dira! is underway. The 
German broadcaster MDR, which chose 
OpenMedia in August 2017 and has been a 
M&B customer since 1995, bought additional 
dira! licences late in the year ahead of the 
planned tight integration of both systems. 
Annova’s relationship with the RTL group 
goes back over 10 years – as an OpenMedia 
customer – and RTL is now operating both 
SCISYS products after an order for dira!.
The M&B division is settling in at its new 
premises in Dortmund and has built a strong 
starting position for 2018. It is preparing for 
future success by making the investments 
needed to maintain its leading product 
offering and to prepare and exploit further 
synergies with Annova.
Annova
2017 is the first year of Annova’s 
contribution to the Group’s results. Its 
overall performance has been robust and 
closely aligned with our expectations at the 
time of its acquisition, although this did not 
reach the levels anticipated by the vendors’ 
forecasts on which a significant proportion of 
contingent consideration was dependent. As 
a result the deferred consideration expected 
to be paid for Annova has reduced from 
€3.9m to €2.0m.
In June, Annova secured its first contract in 
North America with Corus Entertainment, 
which is Canada’s largest media-content 
company. Corus is using Annova’s 
OpenMedia newsroom product for its 
extensive Global News operation. The initial 
project phase successfully concluded in 
November and subsequent deliveries of 
this multi-year, multi-phase programme are 
already being discussed with the customer. 
In August, Annova met an important 
commercial milestone in its flagship 
project with the BBC by concluding the 
implementation phase of the project and 
starting the subsequent transition phase. By 
the end of the year, OpenMedia was deployed 
in the BBC’s major news operations centres 
in Salford and the West Midlands.
Also in August, German public broadcaster 
MDR joined Annova’s customer portfolio as a 
new OpenMedia client when it signed a multi-
million contract to, over time, replace the 
existing newsroom system across its entire 
operation. It is worth reiterating that MDR has 
been a key dira! customer of our M&B division 
since 1995.
Annova’s innovative new NewsBoard 
product for editorial cross-media planning 
– complementing OpenMedia – was 
successfully sold to ARD-Aktuell, the national 
news programme of the influential German 
public broadcaster ARD. This project win was 
particularly important because it positions 
NewsBoard as a bellwether system for other 
public broadcasters. The German public 
broadcaster Radio Bremen became a new 
customer for Annova and its OpenMedia 
product in late 2017, adding to the impressive 
list of important new contracts that it 
managed to secure during the year.
Measures have been taken to continuously 
improve Annova’s internal disciplines and 
governance regime in accordance with the 
demanding internal standards at SCISYS. This 
process will continue in 2018 and beyond.

Initial steps have been taken to bring Annova 
and M&B closer together. This involves 
cooperation on a regular basis between 
respective divisional management as well as 
day-to-day synergies, such as cross-selling 
and co-selling activities, joint trade shows, 
product and innovation as well as product 
delivery and support. 
The divisions will gradually intensify these 
joint activities. This will complement 
Annova’s growth initiatives, which centre on 
continued product innovation and an even 
stronger focus on securing new international 
business. Overall, Annova’s outlook looks 
very strong, with revenues from secured 
orders and recurring revenues from ongoing 
maintenance contracts amounting to three 
quarters of its 2018 revenue target. 
Space
Our Space division has delivered a truly 
stellar performance in 2017. Revenues 
grew year-on-year by 18% to £23.5m and 
the contribution grew by 17% to £4.9m. The 
division’s order book more than doubled to 
£34.1m compared to the previous year. This is 
due in large part to the €18m contract win with 
OHB for the German Heinrich Hertz mission 
(see page 14). 
A variety of additional elements have also 
contributed to the division’s outstanding 
performance. Ongoing projects with 
institutional European space customers 
delivered results ahead of 2017 expectations 
in different application domains, including:
 
•  Scientific missions such as the European 
ExoMars mission to Mars. On this 
programme, SCISYS is responsible for the 
rover vehicle visual localisation flight software 
and the ExoMars Mission Management 
System software, which controls the 
numerous instruments on board the rover 
and manages the rover’s operations on the 
ground. SCISYS is a subcontractor to Airbus 
Defence and Space and Thales (Italy) on 
these projects, respectively, which have an 
aggregate value of €5.4m.
•  Earth-observation missions. In one 
example, SCISYS has a €3.3m contract 
with Airbus to deliver central software 
and hardware for the Payload Operations 
Centre for the French–German climate 
satellite mission, MERLIN. Secondly, 
SCISYS signed a €1.9m contract with GMV 
(Spain) early in 2017 to deliver the mission-
control system for the second generation of 
EUMETSAT’s Polar System. 
The recurring revenues from EU-funded 
Galileo projects and from the operations-
support business to the European Space 
Agency have delivered strong results during 
the year. This accomplishment is particularly 
impressive because it was made in the 
climate of Brexit uncertainty surrounding EU-
funded Space programmes. 
SCISYS is, and will continue to be, a 
pan European group and as noted in 
the Chairman’s Statement, the Board is 
exploring a wide range of Brexit contingency 
plans. Participating conditions apply to 
certain EU-funded work, such as the Galileo 
satellite-navigation programme, which 
require that the participant be EU based (and 
that the ultimate controlling company of any 
participant be an EU-based company) or 
require appropriate waivers to be obtained, 
for it to participate in the programme. While 
we could plan our Galileo activities to be 
carried out by our German subsidiary, which 
clearly satisfies the requirement of being an 
EU based company, SCISYS PLC, which 
is the ultimate holding company, will not 
automatically satisfy this test upon Brexit 
taking effect.
Detailed contingency plans are being 
prepared to affect a group restructure, so that 
the ultimate parent company of the SCISYS 
Group is re-domiciled and based in the EU 
following Brexit. The overarching objective of 
these plans is to protect shareholder value. 
The conclusion of the current negotiations 
between the UK Government and the EU in 
respect of the Brexit transition arrangements 
is expected to be known by late summer  Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s Review
2018. At that juncture the Board, if necessary 
to protect its continued participation in the 
Galileo programme, will seek the necessary 
formal shareholder resolution(s) for the group 
restructure, as part of this restructuring 
procedure. It has every confidence that all 
necessary approvals will be forthcoming and 
thereby eliminate any risk to its continued 
participation in EU-funded programmes. 
The Board also intends to arrange early 
shareholder consultation and seek support 
for pursuing this strategy ahead of the 
SCISYS AGM in June 2018. Other options 
that are being actively considered include 
obtaining appropriate waivers and security 
ring-fencing arrangements. 
The above well-established revenue streams 
were complemented by further new business 
wins, as the growth initiatives pursued by the 
Space division increasingly bears fruit.
Based on our proprietary PLENITER 
software suite for the planning, 
implementation, control and operation of 
complete satellite missions, the division has 
secured an €18m contract with OHB System 
AG to deliver the ground station control 
and communications infrastructure for the 
German national satellite-communications 
mission, Heinrich Hertz. This is significant 
because it positions SCISYS as the sole 
supplier of a complete ground segment for 
a satellite mission and this raises our profile 
further as a supplier of related technologies. 
 
The division’s initiatives into the 
commercial, so-called “New Space”, sub-
sector progressed well, as evidenced by 
the continuation of a PLENITER-based 
project with US-based WorldVu Satellites 
LLP (trading as OneWeb). Late in 2017, 
SCISYS added to this momentum with 
a contract from Sky and Space Global 
UK to deliver a simulator for its Pearls 
Constellation mission. This mission will 
operate approximately 200 autonomous 
communication nanosatellites in carefully 
selected orbits by 2020, giving equatorial 
coverage of the Earth to create an 
affordable global communication network 
and deliver voice, data and instant 
messaging to more than 3 billion people 
who are currently without mobile coverage.
The Space team has grown by 32 staff to a 
total of 200 at year’s end. The successes of 
2017 mean that the division is well positioned 
for sustained organic growth in the medium 
term.
Xibis
Xibis, our SCISYS PLC subsidiary for mobile 
apps and website development based 
in Leicester with a 17-strong team, has 
performed broadly in line with expectations, 
often working in collaboration with the ESD 
division. With effect from 1 January 2018, 
Xibis will be reported as a business unit 
within the ESD division rather than as a 
stand-alone entity. 
On track for further growth
At SCISYS we believe in the opportunities for 
innovative software systems to benefit our 
customers’ operations. We are dedicated to 
achieving our customers’ goals by creating 
and delivering quality software solutions. Our 
overarching commitment is to run a resilient, 
well balanced business that promotes 
sustained commercial success. 
Our strategy has always been to invest in 
innovation and acquisition for long-term 
growth. The 2017 financial year has delivered 
in this respect and facilitated a step change 
in financial performance that provides a 
platform for SCISYS’ continued success. 
We have strengthened our position in 
established niches and have moved 
into adjacent markets on the back of our 
expert know-how, versatile skills and our 
commitment to innovation. Our sales people 
have opened up new territories and started 
to explore new sectors. We are continuously 
investing in our proprietary products and 
reusable software platforms. 
Integration between Annova and M&B has 
already brought immediate successes. For 
2018 we expect that Annova will benefit from 
the major contract wins secured during the 
second half of 2017 and will increasingly 
meet SCISYS’ high internal process and 
governance standards. As the integration 
activities continue we are confident that 
additional synergies will evolve and 
strengthen SCISYS’ profile further in the 
growing segment of system automation and 
control solutions for the media and broadcast 
industry.
SCISYS is a people business and much of 
our success is attributable to our exceptional 
team. A significant number of both highly 
talented graduates and more experienced 
staff have recently been welcomed into the 
fold. During 2017, our staff headcount grew

Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s Review
Executive Directors and divisional 
directors meet at divisional board and 
subsidiary board meetings, as well 
as interacting frequently informally, 
to review the risks and opportunities 
facing the business, the controls 
established to reduce those risks and 
the effectiveness of these controls 
in operation, on an on-going basis. 
The aim of these reviews is to provide 
reasonable assurance that material 
risks and problems are identified and 
appropriate action is taken at an early 
stage. The SCISYS PLC Board confirms 
that procedures to identify, evaluate 
and manage any significant risks 
faced by the Group have been in place 
throughout the year.
The annual strategic and financial plan 
is reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Financial results with comparisons 
between planned and forecast results 
are reported on at least a monthly 
basis by the divisions and subsidiaries 
and discussed at the corresponding 
board meetings, together with a report 
on sales, operational achievements, 
objectives and issues encountered. 
These reports are supplemented by 
interim monthly financial information 
as appropriate. Significant variances 
from plan are discussed and actions 
set in place to address them, and also 
discussed at Board meetings. Approval 
levels for authorisation of expenditure 
are at levels set and cascaded 
throughout the management structure, 
with any expenditure in excess of 
predefined levels requiring approval 
from one or more Executive Directors 
and selected senior managers.
Accordingly the Directors confirm 
that they have carried out a robust 
assessment throughout the year of 
the principal risks facing the Group, 
including any that would threaten its 
business model and future financial 
performance and liquidity. It follows 
that the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue 
in operation and to meet its liabilities as 
they fall due throughout the next, and the 
following two, accounting periods.
by 28% across the Group -- 8% across the 
UK, 16% in Germany (not including Annova) 
and 52% including Annova. 
It is a fundamental strength of our business 
that we maintain an emphasis on our core 
corporate values of mutual trust, respect 
and openness. This is hugely important 
for fostering and evolving our corporate 
culture in line with our values, as well as 
for our strategic objectives as the business 
continues to grow. This applies equally to 
the envisaged integration of Annova, on

Solid foundation and firm trajectory
Our record order book of £91.3m, in 
combination with a strong and growing 
stream of recurring revenues, is testimony to 
the robustness of our business model. We 
anticipate that organic revenue growth will 
continue in 2018 and beyond. Progressing 
from this solid foundation, we will take all 
required measures – including additional 
central requirements (e.g. for cyber security 
and business continuity) – to ensure the 
high level of sustainability that we owe our 
shareholders, customers and staff. 
Once again my sincere thanks go 
to our shareholders, our customers, 
our management, staff and all other 
stakeholders, who have strongly supported 
SCISYS in 2017. The Group has continued 
to make excellent progress during the 
year and we are confident in our ability to 
deliver further progress in 2018: expanding 
the business in a sustainable, resilient, 
balanced way for the benefit of our 
shareholders, customers and staff. 
