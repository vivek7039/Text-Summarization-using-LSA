The true value of data 
is being recognised.
Being able to visualise data isn’t enough today. Senior executives need to be 
able to look into the future. This is why business and IT leaders are actively 
searching for new technologies that deliver more insight, and faster. 
For organisations to survive, business transformation must be prioritised. With its growing capabilities, following the acquisition of Integritie 
in May 2017, Rosslyn Data Technologies is well positioned to become the go-to company for organisations seeking to accelerate business 
outcomes by creating new opportunities from data.
Welcome to the world of intelligent event-driven analytics. Rosslyn Data Technologies has built a powerful platform that provides more than just 
business insight; the data used by customers for reporting and analysis automatically informs users of what decisions must be taken next.

Our solutions are more flexible than traditional IT systems, reducing 
deployment time, requiring less storage space and having a high 
processing capacity. Both small and large enterprises are major 
adopters of cloud analytics and the Directors expect this trend 
to continue for the next few years.
The overall cloud analytics market stands with a total revenue of 
$7.5bn in 2015, and is expected to grow to $23.1bn at a compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.1% from 2015 to 2020.
The growth in data is well documented with the majority of industry 
analysts pointing towards exponential growth in consumer, M2M, 
mobile and enterprise data while industry players are basing their 
business models on 5–10x growth in volume of data over the next 
five years.
The Directors believe that the enterprise user base is increasingly 
recognising the return on investment from analysing their data.
IDC estimates that around one third of data by 2020 will 
be ‘‘useful data if tagged and analysed’’ . This equates to 
approximately 13,000 exabytes compared with total big 
data today of approximately 5,000 exabytes.

2017 was a year of milestones including key client wins 
and partnerships. The final months also culminated in 
Rosslyn Data Technologies’ first acquisition, Integritie, 
a British software company, which completed in May 2017.
The acquisition has bolstered our capability to deliver 
more value to our loyal customers and partners by 
incorporating new technologies into our already powerful 
RAPid Cloud Platform. We also brought into the company 
outstanding talent to support our growth in the future. 
Unlike traditional business intelligence offerings, which 
limit the type and amount of data, RAPid provides a single 
destination that incorporates structured and unstructured 
data for self-service data reporting, analysis and 
management. Furthermore, leveraging the same data 
used for analytics, customers will significantly reduce 
time-consuming, manual processes by automating 
workflows on the same platform. 
Rosslyn Data Technologies is well positioned to meet the 
growing needs of executives and their teams seeking to 
effectively monetise large swathes of under-utilised data 
residing within and external to their organisations. 
Organisations are failing to address business 
issues and opportunities as decision-makers lack 
a centralised and holistic repository of relevant, 
ready-to-use information for continuous reporting 
and analysis. The acquisition of Integritie extends 
and expands our technological capabilities to meet 
the growing information needs of operational 
teams seeking to effectively obtain a complete 
view of their customers, suppliers and employees.”
