 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
2017 PERFORMANCE
Revenue for the Group grew by 4.0% on an organic basis. New 
business wins were 8.7% driven by strong MAP 1 (client sales and 
marketing) performance in all regions, our retention rate was 94.3% 
as a result of our ongoing focus and investment, and like for like 
revenue grew by 1.0% reflecting sensible price increases partially 
offset by weak volumes in our commodity related business. On a 
statutory basis, revenue grew by 15.1%, of which 11.3% was the 
benefit of currency translation.
Underlying operating profit increased by 5.6% on a constant 
currency basis. Operating profit margin increased by 20 basis points 
as we continue to drive efficiencies across the business using our 
Management and Performance (MAP) framework and foreign 
exchange. We also benefitted from the end of the restructuring plan 
in the Emerging Markets and Offshore & Remote last year and the 
absence of these costs this year. We have maintained our focus on 
MAP 3 (cost of food) with initiatives such as menu planning and 
supplier rationalisation, as well as continually optimising MAP 4 
(labour and in unit costs) and MAP 5 (above unit overheads). 
These efficiencies combined with modest pricing increases enabled 
us to offset inflation pressures and reinvest to support the exciting 
growth opportunities we see around the world. On a statutory basis, 
operating profit grew by 18.2%, of which 11.3% was the benefit 
of currency translation.
RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Returns to shareholders continue to be an integral part of our 
business model. As a result of continued strong cash flow 
generation, and limited M&A this year, we paid a special dividend  
of £1 billion (61.0 pence per share) in July and declared an annual 
dividend of 33.5 pence per share (up 5.7%). We have also bought 
back £19 million of shares. Our leverage policy remains unchanged: 
to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings, returning any 
surplus cash to shareholders to target net debt to EBITDA of 
around 1.5x.
GROUP STRATEGY
Food is our focus and our core competence. The food service 
market is estimated to be more than £200 billion; with only around 
50% of the market currently outsourced, it represents a significant 
structural growth opportunity. We believe the benefits of outsourcing 
become further apparent as economic conditions and regulatory 
changes put further pressure on organisations’ budgets. As one of 
the largest providers in all of our sectors, we are well placed to 
benefit from these trends.
Our approach to support services is low risk and incremental, 
with strategies developed on a country by country basis. Our largest 
sector in this market is Defence, Offshore & Remote, where the 
model is almost universally multi service. In addition, we have an 
excellent support services business in North America and some 
operations in other parts of the world. This is a complex segment 
and there are significant differences in client buying behaviour 
across countries, sectors and sub-sectors.
Delivering continued growth
Compass had another strong year.  
North America continues to deliver 
excellent growth, we are continuing to 
make progress in Europe and in Rest 
of World, with trends in our commodity 
related business improving.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 18 GROUP’S GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD
We have a truly international business, with operations in around 
50 countries.
North America (58% of Group revenue) is likely to remain the 
principal growth engine for the Group. We have a market leading 
business, which delivers high levels of growth by combining the cost 
advantage of our scale with a segmented client facing sector 
approach. The outsourcing culture is vibrant and the addressable 
market is significant.
The fundamentals of our businesses in Europe (26% of Group 
revenue) are good. Our investment in MAP 1 sales and retention has 
returned the region to growth and with the creation of sub-regional 
business units, we continue to see opportunities to deliver 
efficiencies and make our operations more competitive.
Rest of World (16% of Group revenue) offers excellent long term 
growth potential. Our largest markets are Australia, Japan and Brazil, 
whilst India and China have strong long term growth potential. 
Lower commodity prices and a weak macroeconomic backdrop 
have impacted our Offshore & Remote business and some of our 
emerging markets, but trends are beginning to improve. We have 
concluded a restructuring of our business to adapt to the changing 
market environment and remain excited about the attractive long 
term growth prospects of the region.
COMPASS’ COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
SECTORISED APPROACH
The global food services market is very large and disparate and we 
find that segmenting the market into various sectors and sub-sectors 
using our portfolio of B2B brands allows us to operate more 
effectively. It allows us to be closer to our clients and consumers and 
better understand their different needs. In this way, we can create 
innovative, bespoke offers that meet their requirements, and in 
doing so truly differentiate ourselves.
SCALE
As we continue to grow, our scale enables us to achieve our goal  
of being the lowest cost, most efficient provider of food and  
support services. Scale is a benefit in terms of food procurement, 
labour management and back office costs. It underpins our 
competitiveness and enables us to deliver sustainable growth  
over time.
MAP CULTURE
We use the Management and Performance (MAP) framework across 
the business. All our employees use this simple framework to drive 
performance across the Group. It helps us focus on a common set 
of business drivers, whether it is winning new business in the right 
sector on the right terms (MAP 1), increasing our consumer 
participation and spend (MAP 2), reducing our food costs (MAP 3), 
our labour costs (MAP 4) or our overhead (MAP 5).
USES OF CASH AND BALANCE SHEET PRIORITIES
The Group’s cash flow generation remains excellent and it will 
continue to be a key part of the business model. Our priorities for 
how we use our cash remain unchanged. We will continue to: 
(i) invest in the business to support organic growth where we see 
opportunities with good returns; (ii) pursue M&A opportunities; our 
preference is for small to medium sized infill acquisitions, where we 
look for returns greater than our cost of capital by the end of year 
two; (iii) grow the dividend in line with underlying constant currency 
earnings per share; and (iv) maintain strong investment grade credit 
ratings returning any surplus cash to shareholders to target net debt 
to EBITDA of around 1.5x.
2017 SUMMARY
Compass had another strong year. North America continues to 
deliver excellent growth, we are continuing to make progress in 
Europe and in Rest of World, with trends in our commodity related 
business improving.
We continue to drive operating efficiencies around the business 
which, combined with the end of the restructuring in our Offshore  
& Remote business, resulted in margin improvement of 20 basis 
points in the period.
Given our excellent cash generation and the strength of the 
business, this year we returned £1.6 billion to shareholders via 
ordinary and special dividends and share buybacks. This reflects 
our commitment to return surplus cash to shareholders whilst 
maintaining an efficient balance sheet.
2018 OUTLOOK
Our expectations for FY2018 are positive, with growth and margin 
improvement weighted to the second half. The pipeline of new 
contracts is encouraging and our focus on organic growth, 
efficiencies and cash gives us confidence in achieving another  
year of progress.
In the longer term, we remain excited about the significant  
structural growth opportunities globally and the potential for further 
revenue growth, margin improvement, as well as continued returns 
to shareholders.
Finally, I’d like to thank all my colleagues within Compass. The last 
11 years have been very rewarding. Together, we have built the 
foundations of a truly great company, and I am confident that 
Dominic will take Compass onto continued future success.
