 2017 has been a year of 
significant change for CPP, 
a year in which we have made 
a number of strategically 
important decisions and 
achieved some important 
milestones. It is this progress 
that will provide the necessary 
focused direction, momentum 
and capability to take the 
business forward and 
capitalise on the significant 
opportunities that exist.

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 12 Our progress
We are pleased with the progress that has been 
made against the strategic priorities that were 
identified during 2016  
We have delivered year-on-year revenue growth 
for the first time since 2011 and have significantly 
increased our global customer base  This growth 
has primarily been achieved through the progress 
made in our Indian and Turkish operations  Both 
markets successfully demonstrate the benefits 
of our strategy to strengthen business partner 
relationships and develop bespoke product 
offerings that meet local consumer needs 
Innovation has continued at pace  In March 2017, 
we acquired Blink, an innovative product and 
systems developer based in Ireland  Since 
acquisition, we have continued to invest and grow 
the Blink business which is already delivering 
functionality for providing innovative product 
solutions into local market places  In time each 
market will have the capability to build new products 
locally for use on a new platform  The first product 
of this type was launched in late 2017 
Additionally, in December 2017, Blink UK received 
permission from the FCA to commence trading as 
a regulated insurance intermediary  It is through 
this entity that we will seek to reinvigorate our UK 
presence  We continue to see the UK market as an 
important component of our global business 
Cost control remains an integral part of the 
strategy  It is important that our cost base remains 
appropriate and is targeted in the right areas to 
enable additional investment into our markets to 
promote growth  We are always mindful of the 
importance of cost control as an integral part 
of our behaviours  In 2017 we carried out a 
fundamental redesign of our organisational 
structure, which as a result, will be more 
responsive to country needs and more effective in 
delivering the Group’s strategy  The new structure 
will also provide a lowering of overall cost 
However, there remains much work to do to 
realise the potential CPP has in a market place 
that is increasingly demanding the services and 
solutions that we provide  We continue to develop 
our presence as an international product 
innovation business  Our focus is on building 
strong trusted relationships with our network of 
business partners around the world and following 
some of the strategically important decisions we 
have made in 2017, we are in a stronger position to 
grow the business 
Organisational change
To promote a simplified business model 
and operating structure, we redesigned 
our organisational structure during 2017  
A decentralised model has been implemented 
which places greater operational responsibility 
on our country operations  This change allows 
our experts in country, who best understand local 
demands and opportunities, to lead in the key 
decisions that affect their business and customers  
The change has also led to less reliance on a large 
UK-based Group function, with the focus now on 
an efficient International Support Centre that will 
provide the appropriate level of support, oversight 
and governance across the Group  The reduction in 
the size of the Group functions and the creation of 
an International Support Centre will lead to cost 
efficiencies, the full benefit of which will be seen 
from 2018 onwards  
“ We have delivered year-on-year 
revenue growth for the first 
time since 2011 and have 
significantly increased our 
global customer base.”

13 Strategic report Our performance
2017 has been a good year with revenue 
growth of 24% over 2016  Revenue from our 
international operations grew by 54%, further 
reducing the historic dependency the business 
had on the restricted UK operation  Customer 
numbers have also increased significantly to 
5 5 million which represents growth of 26%  2017 
has been an excellent year for our Indian business, 
where new bespoke products and strong business 
partner relationships have contributed to revenue 
increasing by 164%  Turkey has also grown in the 
year, again through developing strong and trusted 
relationships with existing business partners and 
enhancing channel capability  Our restricted 
operations and certain other markets, whilst in 
decline, continue to contribute strong renewal 
rates that are higher than the Group rate of 74 8% 
(2016: 74 9%)  
Group revenue has increased by 24% to £91 4 million 
(2016: £73 6 million)  The growth in Indian revenue 
has more than compensated for the continued 
natural reduction in revenue from the renewal 
books in our restricted markets  Profit after tax of 
£4 6 million (2016: £0 5 million loss) has increased 
as a result of the reduction in one-off costs to the 
business  However , underlying operating profit has 
declined to £3 9 million (2016: £8 4 million) which 
reflects the shift in revenue mix from historically 
higher margins in our restricted operations to 
growth markets where margins on the products we 
sell in these markets are at a lower level  During 2018 
we anticipate revenue growth led by sales volumes in 
our international markets which, along with ongoing 
cost control, will contribute to improvements in 
underlying operating profit (on a constant 
GAAP basis) 
Investment platform
We made good progress in freeing up capital 
for the Group to reinvest into our markets or to 
enhance our capabilities through partnerships 
or acquisitions 
In the UK, as recognition that the historic issues 
the business faced are now in the past, the FCA 
agreed to lift the capital and asset restrictions 
placed on HIL and CPPL as part of the Voluntary 
Variation of Permission (VVOPs)  In the case 
of HIL, this has enabled the Group to develop 
a strategy which will see the release of further 
capital in the short to medium term  With most 
of the back book business ring-fenced within 
CPPL, new business opportunities in the UK 
will be focused through Blink UK 
The Group has also completed the sale and 
leaseback of its former Head Office premises in 
York  The sale proceeds were £5 3 million  As part 
of the change to ensure that the Group functions 
are focused on supporting the entire Group, the 
Global Head Office was renamed the International 
Support Centre and relocated to Leeds in 
November 2017 
The available capital created through these 
milestones will be used to support growth in 
our rapidly expanding international markets  
Enhanced investment plans have already been 
implemented in the key markets of India, Turkey 
and China  We also plan to re-enter the UK market 
during 2018  In addition CPP will look to acquire 
or partner with other innovation technology 
businesses to expand our product portfolio 
or to capitalise on distribution networks  
Blink and KYND are examples of this

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 14 International expansion
The Group’s focus is one of international growth 
which includes increased investment into existing 
markets to develop infrastructure, products and 
marketing channels  In addition we will also 
expand into new markets where we believe we can 
harness distribution channels to develop a strong 
regional network  We are building regional hubs 
that provide an efficient operating model and will 
also allow us to expand into adjacent and similar 
markets from a position of strength  We have 
already developed a regional hub for Spain, Italy 
and Portugal led from Madrid and will use India as 
a hub leader for Malaysia and the planned launch 
into Bangladesh in the middle part of 2018  
Customer
Our business partners’ customers are 
important to us  The work we undertake 
to improve our products and distribution 
channels is all designed with their customers as 
a central priority  We are focused on providing 
relevant and engaging services in channels that 
make it simple for customers to engage with 
our products  We will invest in the customer 
experience in 2018 to deliver an even better 
customer journey through increasingly 
digitally led channels 
People
Our colleagues are fundamental to the business 
growth strategy  A strong motivated team is 
crucial to providing great products and services 
to our partners and their customers  We are 
committed to colleague development and 
promoting good behaviours  These will continue 
to be an area of key focus in 2018 with a number 
of programmes in place to further embed this 
within the organisation  
Outlook
The transformation journey we have been on in 2017 has 
created the right environment for further growth  We have 
simplified our operating structure, been decisive with 
organisational change and clearly defined our strategy  
The Group is focused on its strategic priorities, which 
support its existing revenue, new revenue generation and 
growth ambitions  Good progress has been made in 2017  
The Group anticipates growing revenues in 2018 through 
our international markets leading to improvements in 
underlying operating performance (on a constant GAAP 
basis)  Our simplified operating structure, lower cost base 
and available cash resources provides the capability to 
expand through organic product innovation, product 
acquisitions or new partnerships  We have cash available 
that we can use to invest in the many exciting opportunities 
we have already identified, including further geographic 
expansion as well as additional product investments 
and acquisitions  
We are pleased in the direction the business is heading 
and the progress it is making
