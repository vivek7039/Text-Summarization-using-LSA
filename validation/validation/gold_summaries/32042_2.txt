‘It was an interesting and challenging 
year in terms of global news flow, 
especially in the political and 
regulatory sphere, but the year turned 
out to be one of the least volatile in 
financial markets for decades. Against 
this backdrop I am pleased that IG 
once again delivered record revenue 
and profits.’

The business made good strategic progress, commencing the 
rollout of an entirely new trading platform, establishing its limited 
risk trading account globally, further developing its international 
offices and launching an exciting new low-cost passive investment 
product in the UK.
Of course, the changing face of regulation is dominating the 
backdrop for IG’s core product at the moment. The regulatory 
situation is in a state of flux, and it could take some time for clarity 
to be available in all markets. I am, however, pleased that the 
management and the entire IG team have continued to concentrate 
on developing the business, while engaging constructively with 
regulators and innovating to further improve client outcomes.
The recent increase in regulatory concerns around retail leveraged 
trading is perhaps no surprise. Like any growing profitable industry, 
competition has increased in recent years. Unfortunately a number 
of these competitors have been taking a very short-term approach 
to this market and have been targeting inappropriate clients. 
It is clear to me and the Board that IG is not the main target of 
the regulators’ concerns. IG has always sought to operate to the 
highest standards, and we are determined to assist regulators to 
remove poor providers from our market and to improve consumer 
outcomes. I also do not believe that the product itself is at the heart 
of regulators’ concerns – this is primarily about the mis-selling of the 
product by certain providers, either through unrealistic claims or by 
targeting consumers for whom the product is inappropriate.
We have a clear vision at IG: to be a global leader in retail trading 
and investments. As a Board, we are concentrating on developing 
a culture that drives behaviour focused on fair client outcomes, 
and on the creation of a growing, sustainable business. Therefore, 
we recently refreshed the values of the Group, to ensure all of our 
people understand what binds the Company together and what has 
been at the heart of our success over many years. IG’s growth has 
always been based on putting the customer first. We express our 
values as:
• Champion the client
• Lead the way
• Love what we do
By staying true to these values, I believe the Company will emerge 
from the current uncertainty in an even stronger position within 
its core industry and as a credible insurgent within the broader 
investments space.
Board
As previously communicated, Paul Mainwaring joined as CFO 
designate on 11 July 2016 and was appointed to the Board on  
20 July 2016. In September, Sam Tymms was appointed as Chairman 
of the Board Risk Committee, replacing Stephen Hill, who remains a 
member of the Committee.
The intention again this year is to put every Board Director up for 
re-election at the AGM, in compliance with paragraph B.7.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Remuneration
We seek to maintain a remuneration structure which creates a 
balance between rewarding performance against annual objectives 
and the delivery of long-term stakeholder value. Last year we 
carried out a series of adjustments across the organisation to 
ensure we can continue to motivate, recruit and retain high-quality 
people at all levels to deliver against our short-term and long-term 
priorities. This year we reviewed the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy and concluded that it continues to meet the needs of 
the Company. The sharp share price fall on 6 December 2016, 
following the publication of the FCA’s industry consultation, 
impacted the Total Shareholder Return element of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration; this fall reflected shareholder concerns 
about the future prospects of the business. We will keep the Policy 
under review as we receive increased clarity around the external 
environment in which the Company is operating.
Dividend
In line with the previously stated intention to pay out, as an ordinary 
dividend, approximately 70% of the Group’s annual earnings, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend of 22.88 pence per share, 
taking the full-year dividend to 32.3 pence per share, 2.9% ahead of 
the prior year.
IG’s people
The regulatory uncertainty during this year has created a difficult 
backdrop for our people. During this time, we have also further 
developed our global resourcing model and now have substantial 
operations in Krakow and Bangalore. The Board is clear that our 
people remain our greatest asset, and that it is their dedication and 
pride in our Company that have delivered another record year for this 
business. On behalf of the Board, I want to thank them sincerely for 
their ongoing efforts.
Looking forward
The industry is in a period of relative uncertainty. IG has a great track 
record of innovating to lead the industry in operating standards and 
developing our business to reflect a changing regulatory landscape. 
Our excellence in technology and our people’s unswerving 
commitment to fair client outcomes will serve us well as the 
uncertainty clears, and I believe that IG will come out of this period 
as an even stronger player.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
In my third year as Chairman of IG, I am pleased to report that the Company delivered 
another year of strong growth, leading to record revenue and profits, in a relatively quiet 
period for financial markets.
