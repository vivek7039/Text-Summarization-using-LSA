Unless otherwise stated, all operating profit, margin and EPS data refer to  
normalised results, which can be found on the face of the Group Income  
Statement in the first column. The normalised result is defined as being the IFRS 
result excluding intangible amortisation for acquired businesses, US tax reform,  
profit for the year from discontinued operations and consequent UK restructuring. 
The Board believes that this gives a more comparable year-on-year indication of the 
operating performance of the Group and allows users of the financial statements  
to understand management’s key performance measures. Further details relating  
to separately disclosed items are provided in note 5 to the Financial Statements. 
In addition, unless otherwise stated, all pre-tax results and margin data refer to the 
Group’s continuing operations. Further details of discontinued operations can be 
found in note 11 to the Financial Statements.
Constant currency basis compares the current year’s results with the prior year’s 
results translated at the current year’s exchange rates. The Board believes that  
this gives a better comparison of the underlying performance of the Group.

Report are included on page 202.

shareholder value
Dear fellow Shareholder
Introduction and overview
I am delighted that National Express has again delivered another  
year of such strong growth. With revenue and profit both increasing 
markedly and being converted to strong free cash flow, I firmly believe 
that under Dean’s leadership we have established a sustainable 
model of growth. Equally, I am repeatedly struck by the passion, 
commitment and expertise of our staff across the Group in delivering 
the quality of services our customers rightly demand day-in, day-out.
It is particularly pleasing that these Group results have been delivered 
through growth across all of our internationally diversified business. 
North America and ALSA have both had particularly strong years 
delivering significant headline growth. The performance of our UK  
bus and coach businesses to turnaround their significant challenges 
of the first half of 2017, was impressive.
Our strategy of focusing on operational excellence, investing in 
technology and disciplined acquisition and growth in new markets 
has now been delivering for a number of years. As Dean makes clear 
in his report, while we have made important strides in each of these 
areas already, there are also significant opportunities to pursue. As a 
Board we are focused on working with and challenging the executive 
team to realise them.
Progress made with opportunities ahead
Our credentials as an industry-leading operator are strengthened 
every year. Our achievement of the highest safety awards, attainment 
of the highest European Foundation for Quality Management five-star 
rating in three businesses and consistently high customer satisfaction 
scores are testament to a focus on the fundamentals of a transport 
business that is geared for ongoing success.
Equally, however, when one stands back it is clear that we are  
in both a period of significant technological change and also an  
era when the potential application of these myriad innovations is 
presenting challenge, yes, but also exciting opportunities. This is  
now perhaps one of the most pressing challenges for a business  
like National Express: how we focus our investment and resources  
in the area of technological innovation to deliver the greatest benefit 
for our customers and shareholders.
From our industry-leading on-demand scheduling technology at 
Ecolane, through our pioneering use of smart Lytx DriveCam safety 
cameras, to our sophisticated customer pricing and payment 
methods (such as Revenue Management Systems) National Express 
has sought to invest to embrace the opportunities at an early stage. 
With the promising results from these – and other – investments,  
the Board and executive team both believe we are at the start of 
something exciting here.
Our disciplined acquisition strategy also continues to prove successful, 
as both high quality new businesses generating returns of at least 
15% are brought into the Group, but also opening additional new 
growth avenues. As Dean again sets out in his report, the emerging 
urban growth model in Geneva and in major cities in North America 
has been driven by our recent acquisitions. 
Our determination to continue to grow our existing businesses 
through the excellence and technology agendas, and these new 
avenues for expansion, provide us with confidence and optimism  
for future growth.
Dividend
It is with this in mind that the Board has again recommended a 10% 
increase in the final dividend, bringing the full year dividend to 13.51p. 
Subject to shareholder approval, this will be paid on 21 May 2018 to 
shareholders on the register on 27 April 2018.
Finally, I would like to thank Dean and everyone at National Express 
for their continued hard work and commitment to the business and  
its core values.

Environment  
and congestion Technology
The propensity to travel is generally affected  
by levels of economic activity, as represented  
by GDP growth. Although levels of transportation 
and mobility remain relatively stable through  
the economic cycle, periods of GDP growth 
generate additional volume demand and  
pricing benefit.
Opportunity
North America continues to grow, while the 
Spanish economy has strengthened over the  
last couple of years, with levels of tourism also 
very strong – demand for public transport is 
likely to improve further as the economy grows 
and employment levels continue to rise. 
Our response
We continue to look for opportunities to grow 
our businesses in North America and ALSA, 
both by organic means and through bolt-on 
acquisitions in complementary or adjacent 
markets. In 2017, we made nine acquisitions: 
three in North America, three in Spain and three 
in Switzerland.
Our markets are created when state provision  
of public transport is transferred to the private 
sector. There are different models for this,  
with examples ranging from the deregulated 
markets of our UK bus and coach operations, 
through the concessions and franchises of 
Spain, Morocco and German rail, to the school 
bus and transit contracts of North America.
This is supported by a trend towards market 
liberalisation, such as European Union directives 
focused on opening up bus and rail networks.  
In addition, selective countries around the world 
are opening up their markets to foreign operators 
in order to raise standards in their domestic 
public transport markets. Cost saving is 
increasingly a factor too, through recognition  
of the superior efficiency of privately  
operated services. 
Opportunity 
The current size of the European public transport 
market is estimated to be approximately €150 
billion*. Liberalisation of the German and Spanish 
rail and Nordic rail and bus markets present 
opportunities for growth. (*OECD data.)
Our response
We continue to look for opportunities around  
the world where we can add value through our 
expertise and focus on operational excellence, 
while achieving attractive returns.
Our services benefit from increasing 
urbanisation around the world, in particular 
driving demand for bus operations. Existing 
towns and cities are expanding, in addition to  
the creation of new centres of population. In 
2014, 54% of the world’s population lived in 
urban centres and this is projected to grow to 
66% by 2050, while 73% of the population in 
Europe and 82% of the population in North 
America already live in urban centres. These 
trends are driving the requirement for additional 
transportation services, both within and between 
locations. In addition, population growth in the 
UK, Europe and North America will drive further 
demand for public transport services.
Opportunity 
The growth in the urban populations* of the US, 
UK and Spain are forecast to increase by 10%, 
8% and 2% respectively over the next decade, 
driving the need for further public transport 
services, while the combination of an ageing  
and increasingly social and ethnically diverse 
population will drive the need for new products 
and services to meet changing customer needs 
in all of our markets. (*The World Bank DataBank 
– Population estimates and projections.)
Our response
We are growing our presence in urban areas  
in North America and Europe and in additional 
services such as Charter services, transit and 
occasional services. We are also targeting 
further urban contracts in Spain and Morocco.
Modal shift is the move by individuals from  
one form of transport to another. For National 
Express, the relevant move is from the private 
car to bus, coach and rail travel. The biggest 
reason for this is an increase in the cost of 
motoring, such as higher fuel prices and cost  
of insurance, and the increasing use of mobile 
devices, such as tablets and smartphones,  
while travelling, although other factors such  
as environmental concerns and congestion  
can also be important. 
Opportunity 
New low-price entrants into the market over the 
last few years, such as Uber and BlaBlaCar, are 
resulting in fewer drivers’ licences and lower car 
ownership amongst millennials, with demand for 
public transport and coaches likely to increase 
over time in both the UK and Spain.
Our response
We look to offer our customers easy to use, safe, 
reliable and great value services where we will 
continue to look to launch new products and 
services to meet our customers’ needs and 
aspirations.
Environmental concerns continue to have an 
influence on customer behaviour. Bus, coach 
and rail services are significantly more 
environmentally friendly forms of transport than 
the private car or air travel, reducing both the 
level of carbon emissions per person travelling 
and travel congestion. Society as a whole and 
individuals are becoming increasingly concerned 
about the effect of emissions on the environment 
and are explicitly choosing public transport as 
an alternative.
Opportunity 
Improved access to city centre locations, such 
as priority bus lanes for environmentally friendly 
transport and lower congestion. Move to electric 
and hybrid buses to lower emissions.
Our response
We work hard with our Alliance partners, 
Transport for West Midlands and the Metro 
Mayor, to deliver more environmentally friendly 
transport, easing congestion with faster journey 
times from priority bus lanes and lowering 
emissions with Euro six compliant buses. We are 
also investing in hybrid and electric buses in the 
UK, Spain and US.
Technology and innovation are playing their part, 
with travel apps providing real-time information 
as well as customised targeted offers helping  
to generate incremental demand for journeys on 
public transport. Digital platforms are increasingly 
providing customers with end to end journey 
planning, ticketing tools and additional services 
which are delivering greater convenience and 
speedier boarding for passengers, with 
innovations such as contactless payment,  
mobile ticketing and seat reservations.
Technology can also be used to provide more 
efficient planning and real-time scheduling for 
transport services.
Opportunity 
The proliferation of real-time travel information 
and mobile devices improves the customer 
experience, making public transport increasingly 
more attractive compared with the car, while  
the proliferation of smartcards, m-ticketing and 
contactless payment not only provides greater 
convenience for customers but helps to build 
stronger customer relationships. 
Our response
We continue to develop new apps with additional 
functionality and content, while introducing further 
innovative and convenient payment methods 
such as contactless payment and m-ticketing  
in our UK bus operations and online seat 
reservations in our coach operations. 
We are already deploying real-time dynamic 
scheduling and route planning in our North 
America transit business and are looking to 
extend this to other parts of our business.

What we do
National Express operates safe, reliable, 
convenient and good value public 
transportation services. We do this in both 
regulated and unregulated markets, and 
provide services to our customers who  
are private individuals, companies, school 
boards or public authorities. 
We own and lease buses, coaches and trains which we use  
to deliver local, regional, national and international transportation 
services. In our UK coach operations, we also outsource certain 
services to select partner operators. Irrespective of the operator,  
all vehicles are driven and maintained to our global standards, 
either on a network of services scheduled by National Express, or 
delivered point to point on private hire. In Spain, Morocco, North 
America and Germany, services are run typically under an exclusive 
concession or franchise of fixed duration granted by a competent 
body (eg government, school board) and after a competitive bid 
process. In the UK, coach services are unregulated while for UK 
bus services, contracting differs by geography.

Sources of revenue (£m)
Our business model 
How we create value
The Group has delivered over £750 million 
in free cash flow since 2013. 
Growing revenue
National Express generates revenue principally from two sources. 
First, multi-year contracts with school boards or local authorities 
make up 49% of revenue, the majority of which are in North 
America. Revenue is generated either on a per mile/kilometre basis, 
or per route travelled. Second, a further 38% of revenue is earned 
through individual ticket sales to the public, with National Express 
marketing the product and taking revenue risk. This revenue is 
derived from bus or coach journeys in the UK, Spain and Morocco, 
and rail journeys in Germany. Concession revenue from local 
authorities in the UK, Spain and Germany delivers 5% of Group 
revenue with charter/private hire contributing a further 5%. The 
remaining 3% is from other revenue streams such as on board 
entertainment, SMS alerts, booking fees and advertising.
There are many factors contributing to the Group’s strong organic 
revenue growth. In recent years, our increasingly sophisticated  
use of Revenue Management Systems (RMS) has been a notable 
factor. RMS enables us to segment our offer through a better 
understanding of customer needs and purchasing behaviour to 
drive revenue through differential pricing depending on time of 
journey, ticket type, buying channel etc.
Converting it to profit
National Express maintains industry-leading margins through a 
relentless focus on operational excellence in all we do. The direct, 
variable costs of providing transport services across the Group 
depend on a number of factors, but sophisticated network 
optimisation is a key factor. Through continuously reviewing and 
improving network designs and routing, we can optimise peak 
vehicle requirements and increase loading factors, reducing the 
cost of delivering a high quality service to our customers. Our 
diversity and scale is an important factor in managing indirect 
costs, enabling us to optimise cost and quality across the  
Group’s supply base.
Delivering cash flow
National Express has a track record of generating significant  
cash flow from its operations. The Group has delivered over  
£750 million of free cash flow over the last five years and is 
extremely disciplined in its management of working capital and  
the conversion of operating profit into free cash. Maintenance 
capital expenditure is maintained at a level of around 1.1 to  
1.2 times depreciation, efficiently retaining an appropriately  
aged fleet to meet customer requirements. 
Funding returns and reinvestment
By generating cash returns and by managing our net debt  
to between 2.0 and 2.5x EBITDA, we ensure debt levels and 
interest costs can be supported by the profits generated by the 
base business. This allows National Express to do two things.  
First, we can reinvest cash back into the operations to grow  
the business. We have invested £365m both organically and 
inorganically since 2013. This has strengthened our market leading 
positions in coach in the UK and in Spain; built-out key geographic 
positions, such as in New York state in school bus; and enabled  
us to expand into promising adjacent markets such as paratransit 
in Chicago or urban bus in Morocco. Second, we can deliver 
consistent, competitive returns to shareholders. Over the last five 
years the Company has returned £280 million through dividends, 
growing dividend per share by 35%.

Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 8 Our business model and strategy  
How we maintain competitive advantage
National Express is the best value operator 
in price sensitive transportation markets, 
combining the benefits of scale and 
diversity with deep understanding of the 
local markets in which we operate. This 
international-local balance drives a number 
of competitive advantages:
We engage our customers through  
clear marketing and branding
We invest in our consumer brands to ensure the value in our 
products is understood by our customers. The National Express 
and ALSA brands are household names and stand for safety, 
consistency, reliability and affordability. We promote these values  
in our brands to help drive purchasing decisions. 
We prioritise safe operations
The Group operates consistent, world-class safety policies in all 
markets, supported by leading edge technology. Our focus on 
Driving Out Harm supports our primary goal – to get customers  
to their destination safely.
We operate at scale
We seek leadership positions in the markets in which we operate. 
In the UK and Spain, our long haul coach operations are market 
leaders. In urban bus and transit, we are focusing on growing 
urban markets around the world – for example in 2017 we grew in 
London, New York, Chicago, Madrid and Geneva.
We enforce consistent global  
policies and processes
Our global Master Driver and Master Technician programmes  
drive a consistently high standard of capability across our markets. 
Consistency and standardisation in turn allow costs to be optimised 
to enable us to offer best value to our customers. 
We deploy new technologies  
rapidly across the Group
The Group consistently applies technology to improve our 
customer offering (eg deploying free wifi on our premium bus 
services in the West Midlands, development of VUER in our UK 
coach business, development of mobile apps, web interfaces  
and customer portals); to grow the business (eg RMS in our  
coach businesses in the UK and Spain, and on-demand scheduling 
through our Ecolane tool in North America); and to drive operational 
excellence (eg the global roll-out of Lytx DriveCam in support of our 
global safety policies).
We operate a balanced  
and resilient portfolio
Because of the contract nature of a material portion of our 
business, less than 50% of our revenues vary based on passenger 
demand, and we are therefore less exposed to changes in travel 
patterns caused by economic cycles. In addition, the nature of 
some of our main contracts (eg in school bus transportation) 
means that we are less of a target for technological disruption  
(from unregulated technology-based companies who target market 
share growth at a loss) than others who participate in only B2C 
markets. Our diversification means that no one contract accounts 
for more than 4% of revenue. All of this helps us to generate cash 
consistently, allowing us to invest prudently over the medium to 
long term, and to minimise our financial risk.

We continue to look to grow our unique portfolio of 
international bus, coach and rail businesses through 
selective bolt-on acquisitions and diversification into 
complementary markets
Performance
 – All eligible businesses, ALSA and our UK bus and coach operations,  
now have EFQM* five-star ratings
 – Both our UK bus and coach operations re-awarded the prestigious  
British Safety Council Sword of Honour
 – Improved customer satisfaction in our UK businesses and in ALSA
 – 19% underlying improvement in FWI index**
 – Strong retention rate of 96% in our North America school bus business
 – Another record year for passenger numbers at ALSA
 – Launched World Class Maintenance and safety initiatives across each  
of our businesses
 – New mobile websites and ticketing apps are driving higher online 
transactions, conversion rates and lowering costs – eg ALSA has  
seen a 10% increase in sales through digital channels
 – Contactless pay launched across the UK business, providing faster,  
more convenient methods of payment
 – Our real-time revenue management systems in ALSA and our UK coach 
operations are growing revenue through both improved yield and 
passenger growth
 – Lytx DriveCam technology is now fully implemented in our UK bus  
and coach operations and North America transit, delivering a reduction  
in the number of collisions and associated costs
 – We have acquired nine bolt-on acquisitions in the year:
 – three in North America: the significant acquisition of a Chicago 
paratransit operator, securing entry into the second largest paratransit 
market in North America; and the acquisition of two school bus and 
charter businesses in Cincinatti and Rochester, New York
 – six in ALSA: two urban transport companies in Madrid and Granada; 
three businesses in the Geneva area including two additional 
businesses in the Swiss ski transfer market; and a charter transport 
services company in Madrid
Future outlook
 – Target further passenger growth in the ALSA and our UK bus and coach 
operations through our digital initiatives
 – Launch new products and services including new routes, new express 
and charter services and new ticketing options
 – We will continue to leverage our customer reputation to win new business 
in North America

Spain where we can extend our offering into new regional markets and 
cities or build further scale in existing markets and cities, also enabling us 
to drive incremental revenue and profit through the provision of additional 
commercial services such as charter services, while also making greater 
use of our fleet
 – We see a strong pipeline of future opportunities, both in bidding and in 
M&A, as the liberalisation agenda continues across the world
 – We will seek investments in assets that present a platform for future 
growth, and will consider JV arrangements with the right partners
Measuring our  
progress
We believe passenger growth and improvements in safety standards through 
a reduction in safety-related incidents are key indicators of whether we are 
driving high safety and service standards and which will ultimately help 
deliver further growth in revenue, cash and profit.
A rising proportion of sales transacted through our digital channels 
demonstrates that our customers value more convenient and faster ways to 
pay. At the same time, the transfer of transactions away from traditional ticket 
offices and third party sales agents to digital channels is driving operational 
efficiencies and reducing costs.
We maintain a disciplined approach to investing and target project returns 
well above our cost of capital, typically targeting returns of 15% or above. 
Across the business as a whole, disciplined allocation of capital is measured 
through a focus on ROCE, a key element of executive remuneration.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 13 Key performance indicators Our strategy is  
delivering results
National Express has delivered perhaps 
its strongest ever set of results in 2017, 
with good growth across all of our 
internationally diversified portfolio. 
Dean Finch 
Group Chief Executive
Introduction
National Express has delivered perhaps its strongest ever set of 
results in 2017, with good growth across all of our internationally 
diversified portfolio. We have achieved particularly strong 
performances in both North America and ALSA. Our performance  
in the second half of 2017 in the UK has reversed the declines seen  
in the first six months, to deliver annual growth in both our bus and 
coach businesses.
I believe that we are seeing the benefit of our focus on operational 
excellence, technology investment and disciplined acquisition in  
these results. North America’s combination of customer focus, 
contract retention and successful acquisitions has driven a record 
result. ALSA has also delivered a very strong performance, propelled  
by its increasingly sophisticated real time Revenue Management 
System (RMS). Both our UK bus and coach businesses have  
used sophisticated pricing techniques and efficiency programmes  
to drive second half performances that have more than reversed  
their first half challenges.
These divisional performances are reflected in the strength of  
our Group results. We again delivered a record statutory profit of 
£134.3 million (up nearly 12% on last year’s record). Free cash flow 
also increased to £146.4 million (2016: £138.6m) and our gearing 
reduced to 2.3 times EBITDA. With this strong performance we  
are proposing a 10% increase in the final dividend. Our consistent 
delivery is also reflected in the fact that over the last five years we 
have generated over £750 million of free cash flow and, including  
this year’s proposed final dividend, returned over £325 million  
to shareholders.
While I am pleased our international portfolio and strategic focuses 
have driven another year of growth, I am firmly focused on the future. 
We have significant opportunities still to capture to drive organic 
growth as well as new avenues for further expansion emerging.
With the Group out of UK rail we have removed both significant 
financial commitments and political distraction and are able to 
concentrate on growing our bus and coach presence in our existing, 
interesting adjacent and targeted new, markets.
We have moved deliberately away from a business model where our 
prosperity was significantly determined by the instabilities of UK rail. 
Indeed, a key attraction of our internationally diversified portfolio is 
that it has a significantly reduced exposure to any one country’s 
political or regulatory movement.
Our largest contract is worth less than four percent of our Group 
earnings; we are less dependent on the success or failure of a 
specific contract. So, rather than spending tens of millions of pounds 
on rail bids where we may win, say, one in four competitions – which 
were also won on increasingly eye-watering terms, with vanishingly 
thin returns – we have decided to invest our strengthening resources 
on improving the quality, safety and efficiency of our operations as 
well as on attractive acquisition opportunities. We have expanded in 
and into large, wealthy cities and also launched successfully in three 
new markets (Germany, Bahrain and Switzerland) in recent years. 
These three new market entries have all been profitable in their first 
full year of operations.
Our strategy therefore remains focused on three key pillars:
 – Operational excellence, including organic growth, tight cost control, 
rigorous cash flow management and the disciplined allocation of 
capital to maximise returns;
 – Investment in technology to drive customer-focused innovation  
and excellence, improved safety performance and greater cost 
efficiency; and,
 – Growth through targeted acquisitions in the world’s most affluent 
cities and regions.
I will now set out how we are already delivering against each of these 
pillars and outline some of the emerging opportunities for further 
benefits to come.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 14 Chief Executive’s review We also continue to forge and leverage strong partnerships with  
local authorities to tackle key operational and customer service 
challenges. For example, through a joint bid with Transport for  
West Midlands, our bus business has recently secured Department 
for Transport investment for new bus lanes on the important Harborne  
to Birmingham city centre route. We have introduced our state-of-the-
art Platinum buses to this route, with the aspiration of repeating the 
significant increases in passengers we have seen where previous 
schemes (such as Lode Lane in Solihull) have combined journey  
time savings with new, premium vehicles. It is precisely this strong 
partnership approach that we are looking to further enhance by 
working closely together to make sure the 2022 Commonwealth 
Games in Birmingham are a success and deliver significant  
transport improvements before the games begin.
Investment in technology
We are in a period of significant technological change. The seemingly 
constant stream of innovations presents many opportunities for 
customer-focused businesses such as ours. We are working on 
innovative new transport technologies, with ALSA developing 
autonomous, electric vehicle projects in Madrid, for example.  
Beyond this, our task is to focus on the improved outcomes that  
can be delivered through the right technologies, rather than chasing 
every innovation that appears on the market. I believe new technology 
presents a real opportunity to drive organic growth, improve standards 
and realise cost efficiencies. We have therefore focused our interest  
in three principal areas.
First, improving our service to customers. Our RMS is a significant 
example of this. This allows us to provide real-time pricing that 
becomes increasingly sophisticated through time as it builds up a 
‘memory’ of historic customer behaviour and applies it to the current 
market. This has allowed our UK coach services to respond to the 
reduction in travel demand after the terrorist attacks in 2017, with  
a prompt, targeted lowering of ticket prices to sustain passenger 
numbers. That our UK coach business carried more passengers  
in 2017 than 2016, despite the significant challenges it faced, is 
testament to the benefit of this real-time and granular pricing.  
Overall, our UK coach services saw an underlying revenue benefit  
of two percent from RMS, with seat occupancy rates also up two 
percent – also demonstrating the efficiency benefit of the technology. 
Our Spanish long haul services which have RMS installed also saw 
revenue increase by 3.9% and seat occupancy rates up over  
two percent.
Strategy
Operational Excellence
We aim to give our customers safe, punctual and frequent transport 
services at excellent prices. During 2017, we gave our customers 
lower fares and improved services. We also invested to improve the 
safety of our services and their ease of use through enhancements 
including the provision of better real time information, mobile journey 
planning tools, contactless ticketing and faster services with better 
end to end connections.
This relentless focus on improving our service to customers and  
our fares, coupled with constantly improving the efficiency of  
our operations, was rewarded with an increase in the number of 
passengers we carried and with improving customer satisfaction. 
Across the Group we have carried over 882 million passengers, up 
1.2% on a continuing basis, on 2016. Our value for money scores 
were already high and are rising, for example: UK coach’s score  
was over 87%, up 0.5% year-on-year; and, ALSA’s 72% was up  
6% year-on-year.
Our businesses have again demonstrated their industry-leading 
customer service credentials in the year. ALSA has achieved a  
record customer satisfaction score of 7.4 out of 10 (up 4.8% 
year-on-year) and also won the IZO ‘Best Customer Experience  
for the Transport Industry’ award, the largest satisfaction survey 
conducted in Spain. Our UK bus business achieved a record-
equalling customer satisfaction score of 87% in the independent 
Transport Focus survey (also up 1% year-on-year). Our UK coach 
business’ customer satisfaction score was also up, three percent to 
86%, with the independent Temkin Group Net Promoter Score index 
ranking National Express fourth in its select group of companies. 
North America again delivered another year of customer satisfaction 
above 90%, coming in at 91.2%.
We are also seeing the benefits in the safety performances of our 
business. Safety is our top priority and we established our Driving  
Out Harm programme in 2010 with the deliberately ambitious 
objective of removing all harm caused by our businesses. I am 
delighted that since Driving Out Harm’s inception, we have reduced 
harm, as measured by our industry-leading Fatalities and Weighted 
Injuries (FWI) index, by 74% per million miles operated.
We are also receiving significant external recognition for our safety 
programmes and performance. Both UK bus and coach received 
five-star British Safety Council scores, and their highest honour,  
the Sword of Honour: bus’ score of 97.4% was the highest in the 
transport industry; coach also received a ROSPA Gold Award. ALSA 
received two awards from MAPFE: the ‘International Road Safety’  
and ‘Best Initiative in the Prevention of Accidents’ awards. And our 
North American school bus business has again received the highest 
possible safety rating from the Federal Motor Carrier Administration. 
Safety will remain our Group’s – and my personal – top priority as 
long as I am Chief Executive. I will say more about our technology 
investments that are a crucial part of our plan for further improvement 
in the next section.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 15 Chief Executive’s review Investing in technology to  
improve safety standards
We are committed to investing in technology to improve 
standards and secure efficiencies. One area where we have 
shown particular leadership is through the installation and use  
of smart safety cameras on our vehicles. Lytx DriveCam, 
pictured below, is an industry-leading system that allows the 
recording of accidents or incidents worthy of subsequent review. 
This technology is being rolled out across our businesses and is 
already fully installed in the UK. The videos allow us to improve 
safety and driving standards through tailored training and also 
provide crucial evidence for insurance claims, helping us 
significantly reduce the costs of accidents where it is installed. 
New technology presents a real 
opportunity to drive organic growth, 
improve standards and realise  
cost efficiencies. 
In 2018, we expect RMS to underpin further organic growth and 
deliver a one percent underlying benefit in both UK coach and ALSA. 
We also continue to see significant growth in digital sales channels 
across our businesses. It is by far the most significant means of 
payment for UK coach, with 66% of revenue coming through digital 
channels (up 3% year-on-year). ALSA saw significant growth in digital 
channels in 2017 of over 9%, with more than 40% of all its sales now 
through digital. On ALSA’s long haul coach services, 44% of all sales 
are through digital channels. UK bus is also experiencing a rapid rise 
in the number of passengers using digital channels, with 10% of all 
passengers now travelling on m-tickets. This growth in m-ticket use 
has almost entirely occurred during 2017 and this trend is 
accelerating in 2018.
We are investing to accelerate this shift. We have introduced new 
contactless ticket machines to our UK buses, allowing a wide range  
of digital and contactless ticket types to be used. These machines 
enable the daily capping of prices and allow us to move decisively 
away from the use of exact cash fares to travel. Our customers in 
Coventry started using these new machines in January and they  
will be fully operational across the whole of the West Midlands in  
April, making it the single largest contactless network outside of 
London. We will be complementing this with the launch of a much-
improved app in March that will allow real-time tracking of buses, 
among other customer-friendly features.
We have also invested to make UK coach’s digital presence easier, 
quicker and more responsive to use. An upgrade to our UK coach 
website has significantly reduced the number of clicks necessary  
(and therefore time taken) to purchase a ticket, with online sales 
conversion rates increasing 3% during the year. We have also  
piloted a successful seat reservation system which will be rolled  
out network-wide in 2018. These innovations and investments  
have: helped raise its rating in the App Store to 4.5 stars (up from  
2.5 stars at the start of 2017); seen www.nationalexpressgroup.com 
significantly improve its Google search optimisation scores so it is 
now the best ranked land transport website in the UK; and also been 
recognised with the Best Technology Award at the UK Coach Awards 
for the customer entertainment system, VUER.
Our North America business is also accelerating its use of technology 
to make it more responsive to customer demands. During 2017  
we launched new apps in transit and school bus, and through  
our market-leading software company Ecolane, for paratransit 
customers. The Ecolane app allows users to book and view trips in 
real time and also proactively alerts them when their vehicle is on its 
way. We have also – uniquely within the industry – installed an online 
complaints management system in all of our school bus depots.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 16 Chief Executive’s review German Rail and Bahrain continue to use market-leading 
technologies to enhance their services to customers. In Germany,  
our ‘NX-Scout’ WhatsApp group, which provides up-to-date travel 
information for customers, has the equivalent of around 15% of  
daily passengers signed up. In Bahrain, the local app has seen  
a 50% increase in downloads during 2017, and the ‘GO Card’ 
smartcard is used in between 45% and 50% of journeys.
The second area where technology is also playing a very important 
role in our determination to continue to improve our performance  
is safety. In 2017, we saw significant progress in our roll-out of the 
industry-leading Lytx DriveCam smart safety cameras that allow 
incidents to be recorded and analysed. This provides the opportunity 
for both tailored driver training and fuller evidence to be used in 
insurance claims. The cameras are now installed: across all our  
UK fleet; in 6,351 vehicles in North America, with a target of around 
another 10,000 by the end of the year; and in 150 vehicles in ALSA, 
with a target of over 1,000 (around 45% of the Spanish fleet) by the 
end of the year.
There are very encouraging results of reductions in ‘event severity’, 
the number of incidents and insurance costs where the smart  
safety cameras have been in place the longest. In North America,  
for example, we started rolling Lytx DriveCam out in 2014 and it  
is now installed in 46 locations. The results so far show that when 
comparing the costs of claims from preventable street accidents  
for the 12 months prior to fitment against post-installation, there  
has been a 30% reduction. So with the significant further roll out 
programme in 2018, we expect to reap further driving standards, 
safety and cost benefits over the coming years.
Alongside the investment in the smart safety cameras we have begun 
a comprehensive programme addressing speed management across 
the Group. Technology is already playing a crucial role in identifying 
issues and allowing targeted management interventions. It will be 
augmented in 2018 with a comprehensive internal communications 
campaign to reinforce the crucial importance of speed management. 
We will have the near universal roll-out of this technology by the end 
of 2018.
We are also investing in technology which improves our third principal 
area: business and cost efficiency. Two North American pilots are 
providing particularly interesting opportunities. First, a new budget 
management system which provides, to a very granular level, detailed 
cost management for local management use but also central review. 
Second, a business management system will systematise good 
customer and operational practice across our business supporting 
local management and also enhancing central oversight. In a 
continent-wide business where customer relationships are key, 
striking the right balance between local flexibility and central control  
is a crucial challenge for running an effective and efficient business.
These two emerging tools are providing encouraging early results  
and exciting opportunities for the future. By using the business 
management system we have been able to revise our fleet 
management system and in so doing have identified over 750 buses 
we believe can be more effectively deployed in 2018. This will have 
direct benefits in terms of a significant reduction in new capital 
requirements. This system is being extended to cover our 
maintenance processes and we expect to again generate improved 
efficiency in our systems generally and also allow for greater claims 
on parts warranties, specifically.
Acquisitions and new opportunities
With our strong and sustainable cash flows, we have targeted new 
acquisitions in recent years to deliver growth as well as add quality 
new businesses to our portfolio. In 2017, we continued to do this  
in a disciplined manner, with targeted returns above 15%. We made  
a further nine acquisitions in the year, with North America remaining 
the focus of our capital allocation, but ALSA also adding six  
new businesses.
The acquisitions we made in recent years continue to perform 
strongly and we have a strong pipeline of further opportunities that  
we are actively pursuing in both North America and through ALSA. 
Through the appointment of James Stamp as Group Commercial 
Director – previously KPMG’s UK Head of Transport and Global  
Head of Aviation – and other hires in his team, we have strengthened 
our Group support to the divisions in their acquisition and new  
market identification.
Our ALSA acquisitions include three that build on our successful 
Swiss ski market entry through AlpyBus and strengthen our presence 
in the Geneva area. We are developing Geneva as an emerging 
growth ‘hub’ with expansion into local school bus and discretionary 
transport alongside the growing transfer business; AlpyBus itself  
grew significantly in 2017. ALSA made another three acquisitions in 
the year that add new bus operations in Madrid and Granada as well 
as ‘Maitours’, which provides: staff transfers for a large local airline 
and national bank headquarters; an urban transport contract in 
Azuqueca, Guadalajara; and school bus services in Madrid. 
We made three acquisitions in North America during 2017,  
adding over 800 vehicles across the school bus, paratransit,  
transit and special education sectors. These acquisitions included 
Cook-DuPage Transportation, providing entry into the US’s largest 
paratransit market (Chicago). Paratransit is a fast-growing market  
and this acquisition therefore strengthens our credentials in this 
important sector.
By using our presence – helped by recent acquisitions – in large city 
markets to operate services across, for example, school bus, transit, 
paratransit, charter and employee shuttle, we can offer competitive 
pricing and operational resilience as we benefit from the synergies 
between the different operations. With a greater local concentration 
we can also develop strong local relationships. Across the Group, our 
best markets are often those where we successfully combine service 
excellence, competitive pricing and strong relationships. We believe, 
therefore, that developing and expanding this approach provides an 
interesting opportunity for new growth.
Our North American acquisitions have also brought new thinking  
into our business and we believe one area where we will benefit  
in particular is in charter. Learning from the way a recently acquired 
business had developed and grown its own local charter revenue,  
we see the opportunity for significant nationwide growth. We estimate 
the national charter market to be worth more than $1.5 billion a year. 
In 2017, for example, National Express only captured around three 
percent of this market, demonstrating the opportunity for growth.
We have continued to target new growth opportunities through 
selected bidding. ALSA has recently submitted a joint venture bid  
to operate a bus contract in Rabat, to consolidate our position in 
Morocco. We plan to submit further German rail bids this year to 
augment our presence in North Rhine Westphalia.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 17 Chief Executive’s review Recognising exceptional  
driving performance
Our People Value is to develop the talents, reward the 
exceptional performance and respect the rights of all our 
employees. Our Master and Advanced Driver programme is a 
prime example of this. If drivers have two consecutive years of 
excellent service and performance (including, for example, no 
preventable accidents or customer complaints and excellent 
driving assessments) they become an Advanced Driver. Three 
consecutive years of this exceptional performance achieves 
Master Driver status. These drivers are presented with their 
awards at a ceremony (that families are encouraged to attend) 
and receive a distinctive tie and free membership of the Institute 
for Advanced Motorists, providing potential insurance benefits. 
We now have 903 Advanced Drivers and 728 Master Drivers 
across the Group and this increasingly popular programme 
continues to grow.
Master Drivers receive a distinctive tie to recognise their achievement
I look forward to 2018 with both  
excitement and optimism. I am  
ably supported by a strong, dynamic 
management team that operates  
National Express’ many businesses  
with relentless focus and efficiency. 
I am very proud of our industry-leading work in the community. We 
launched the National Express Foundation in 2012 and in that time 
have supported over 14,200 youngsters in the West Midlands, East 
London, South Essex and Medway. This support has helped local 
community groups working with disadvantaged young people as  
well as those who would otherwise not be able to access further or 
higher education because of financial challenges, attend college or 
university. This year National Express Group will provide £300,000  
to the foundation to further its good work.
Equally, our leadership on the Living Wage has been a source of 
pride. Our UK bus operations have been a Living Wage Foundation 
accredited employer for 2 years and the feedback from staff has  
been very positive. Our UK coach business is currently securing the 
accreditation; it has introduced the Living Wage Foundation living 
wage to directly employed staff and will shortly roll this out to 
contractors’ employees.
I was very sad to hear of the untimely passing of John Devaney  
in January this year. John served as National Express’ Chairman 
between April 2009 and January 2013. John also served as  
Executive Chairman for a period during this time, including leading  
the challenging rights issue that rescued the business. John brought 
a wealth of experience to his time at National Express and I always 
found him a helpful source of both support and challenge, essential 
for any Chief Executive. Both personally, and on behalf of National 
Express, I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to John’s 
family and friends.
Outlook
We expect to deliver growth in every business again in 2018,  
as our strategy continues to generate strong shareholder value.
We will remain focused on operational excellence and technology 
investment to deliver high quality services to customers at good  
value prices. Our businesses are increasingly sophisticated, using 
technology to get ever closer to our customers and drive through 
efficiencies in our operations, whether RMS, Lytx DriveCam or 
contactless ticketing. We are confident therefore that we will deliver 
organic growth in each business in 2018 and complement this with  
a strong acquisition pipeline of opportunities with returns of at least 
15%, across ALSA and North America. We are actively working on 
further acquisitions.
Our strong and sustainable cash flow – we believe our free cash flow 
in 2018 will be broadly similar to 2017 – combined with £20 million of 
fuel cost savings and the benefit of acquisitions made at the end of 
2017, give us strong tailwinds. These have recently been strengthened 
by US tax reform, which will see our Group effective tax rate reduced 
to the low 20s, in percentage points.
I look forward to 2018 with both excitement and optimism. I am ably 
supported by a strong, dynamic management team that operates 
National Express’ many businesses with relentless focus and 
efficiency. The technological tools now available to the business  
give us the granularity and transparency to control and manage the 
business in a way that I think could be transformational over time.  
The strength and resilience of the business proved to be very 
impressive in 2017 and will continue to underpin our future in  
the years to come. Our strong cash generation coupled with our 
numerous growth opportunities give me confidence as we once  
again look ahead to deliver growth in revenue, profits and returns  
in the years ahead.

2017 revenue 2,321
Group revenue for the period was £2,321.2 million (2016: £2,093.7m), 
an overall increase of 6.1% on a constant currency basis (up 10.9%  
on a reported basis with £94 million of foreign currency gains on 
translation). Revenue growth of £54 million from our existing 
businesses, representing organic growth of 2.5%, was boosted by  
a further £79 million from acquisitions, principally in North America 
and Spain.
Revenue growth has been delivered across the business with 
performance particularly strong in our overseas businesses. North 
America delivered 10.1% growth in constant currency, with growth 
being driven by the full year benefit of acquisitions completed in 2016, 
augmented by the three new bolt-on acquisitions made in the second 
half of 2017. Organic growth benefitted from another successful 
bidding season in which we achieved an average price increase  
of 2.4% across the entire portfolio and 3.0% on those contracts up  
for bid and renewal. ALSA also delivered a strong performance, with 
revenue growth of 3.6% on a constant currency basis. This growth 
was driven predominantly in Spain, most notably on our Spanish long 
distance routes where our revenue management system contributed 
3.9% to revenue growth on our long haul services. This was 
augmented by six bolt-on acquisitions made in the year.
Dear shareholders
I am delighted to be writing to you for the first time as Group  
Finance Director of National Express. The strength of the financial 
performance delivered in 2017, and outlined below, demonstrates  
the Group’s strong and stable financial position.
Presentation of results
To supplement IFRS reporting, we also present our results on a 
normalised basis which shows the performance of the business 
before intangible amortisation for acquired businesses, US tax reform, 
profit for the year from discontinued operations and consequent UK 
restructuring. The Board believes that this gives a more comparable 
year-on-year indication of the operating performance of the Group 
and allows the users of the financial statements to understand 
management’s key performance measures. Unless otherwise  
noted, all references to profit measures throughout this review are for 
continuing operations for both the current and prior reporting period.
Changes to reporting segments 
Following the strategic exit from UK rail operations in February  
2017, the UK business was restructured with UK Bus and UK  
Coach combined under a single UK management structure to  
drive cost reductions and facilitate better, clearer decision making.  
To align external reporting with internal decision making structures, 
we are presenting the UK as a single operating segment. We will 
continue to disclose revenue separately for our UK bus and coach 
operations on the Group website www.nationalexpressgroup.com,  
in order to provide an understanding of drivers of performance in  
the UK division. 
Statutory profit
The Group again delivered a record statutory profit after tax 
amounting to £128.4 million (2016: £114.9m) driving basic earnings 
per share of 25.7 pence (2016: 23.0p), an increase of 11.7%.

We have delivered profit growth across each of our businesses, with 
the strongest performance in our North America business, where 
normalised operating profit increased by 6.6% on a constant currency 
basis and by 12.3% on a normalised reported basis. Organic growth 
was boosted by acquisitions made in 2016 and 2017, with those 
acquisitions made in 2016 achieving returns of at least 15%.
In ALSA, normalised operating profit increased by 4.4% on a constant 
currency basis, driven by a combination of organic growth, and the 
benefit of acquisitions made in 2016 and 2017, together with cost 
efficiencies and lower fuel costs. Reported normalised operating 
profit increased by 12.0%.
Our UK business delivered normalised operating profit growth of 
5.3% with the flow through of management actions on revenue 
supplemented by a programme of cost saving and efficiency 
initiatives which delivered £10 million of savings.
Our German Rail operations delivered a strong normalised operating 
profit contribution of €5.9 million (2016: loss €1.8m), which was 
boosted as discussed above by the element of catch up on revenue 
not previously recognised.
Central costs have increased by £6.8 million, reflecting strategic 
investment in a number of Group-wide initiatives together with a  
new International Development Team. Central costs also include  
the amounts expensed for unsuccessful bidding in the Middle East 
and Singapore.

Group normalised operating profit margin was stable at 10.4%  
(2016: 10.4%) as margin growth in the UK and ALSA offset a small 
decline in North America driven by significant inflationary pressure  
on drivers’ wages.
We delivered a robust performance in our UK business, despite softer 
market conditions, with revenue growth of 0.6% and an improving 
trajectory in the second half of the year. This is the result of a number 
of decisive management actions taken in the first half of the year 
which drove an improved performance in the second half. Our UK  
bus operations grew revenue by 0.3% in the second half following the 
successful introduction of a number of low fare zones, reversing the 
declines seen in the first half of the year. For the year as a whole, bus 
revenue declined 0.5% with concessionary revenue down 1.3%, while 
commercial revenue was broadly flat despite a 1.5% reduction in 
mileage. Our UK coach operations delivered revenue growth of 1.8%, 
where our Revenue Management System helped drive passenger and 
revenue growth to overcome a reduced propensity to travel over the 
summer following a number of terror events. We delivered particularly 
strong performance in the final quarter of the year.
German Rail delivered revenue growth of 20.4% on a constant 
currency basis and up 28.9% on a reported basis to £79.0m.  
This growth was boosted by the clarification of our revenue position 
which included latest passenger count data, allowing us to recognise 
all revenue earned. The 2017 results therefore include an element of 
catch up from prior years that we were not able to recognise before 
this year.

Group normalised operating profit increased by 6.0% to  
£241.5 million on a constant currency basis, up 11.0% on a reported 
basis (2016: £217.5m). The Group delivered a strong performance 
from its existing businesses with a £24 million contribution 
representing growth of 10.5%. This was supplemented by a strong 
contribution from the full year benefit of acquisitions completed in 
2016 together with the acquisitions made in the second half of 2017.
These results include cost inflation of £41 million, most notably in the 
form of driver wage inflation in North America. We have retained our 
disciplined approach to cost management and through a programme 
of efficiency measures across the Group, including the £10 million of 
efficiencies delivered through the reorganisation of our UK business, 
we have generated total cost efficiencies of £25 million.
We also saw a £5 million benefit from lower fuel prices year-on-year 
as a direct result of our hedging policy.
We have benefitted from £10 million of currency translation during the 
course of the year, driven by the weakening of Sterling following the 
result of the ‘Brexit’ referendum. This benefit was mostly delivered in 
the first half of the year with year-on-year currency translation broadly 
flat in the second half as we cycle post-Brexit Sterling levels in the 
prior year.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 20 Group Finance Director’s review This constitutes a strong 61% free  
cash flow conversion creating a solid 
platform for investing in growth and  
paying dividends. 
Net finance costs decreased by £12.0 million to £38.0 million  
(2016: £50.0m), reflecting lower interest costs following the successful 
bond refinancing in November 2016 and continued optimisation of the 
Group’s funding base as noted below.
We recorded a loss of £3.5 million (2016: profit of £1.1m) from 
associates, reflecting the write down of our investment in a minority 
stake in Deutsche Touring Group, a German partner in Eurolines, 
which entered into administration in the early part of this year.
Normalised profit before tax of £200.0 million grew 11.7%  
on a constant currency basis, up 18.6% on a reported basis  
(2016: £168.6 million).
The normalised tax charge from continuing operations was  
£48.0 million (2016: £31.4m), a normalised effective tax rate of 24.0% 
(2016: 18.6%). The increase in the normalised effective tax rate is 
largely the result of a mix of profits, with a greater proportion of profits 
coming from the US where federal corporate income tax rates have 
been higher relative to the UK and Spain. This was also accompanied 
by changes in BEPS legislation relating to corporate tax interest 
deductibility.
On 22 December 2017, the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed 
into law representing the most significant change to the US tax 
system in the last 30 years, reducing US federal corporate income  
tax from 35% to 21% from 2018. This resulted in a £7.5 million net  
tax credit on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities.
Looking forward, we anticipate that the Group’s effective normalised 
tax rate will be in the low 20s percentage range, assuming no further 
reform in any of our major markets.
Normalised basic earnings per share were 29.1 pence (2016: 26.3p), 
an increase of 10.6%.
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
ROCE is a key performance measure for the Group, guiding how  
we deploy capital resources and as such is a key component of 
executive incentives. ROCE is 11.9% (2016: 11.9%), demonstrating  
our disciplined approach to capital allocation and balance  
sheet management.

Our strong and sustainable cash flows support a capital investment 
programme that maintains fleet age at acceptable levels. Our current 
target is to invest around 1.1 to 1.2 times depreciation in net 
maintenance capital expenditure.
Free cash flow improved by £7.8 million to £146.4 million (2016: 
£138.6m) driven by the growth in EBITDA which was offset by net 
maintenance capital expenditure, £30.5 million higher than the prior 
year. The majority of the maintenance capital investment has been  
in fleet replacement predominantly in ALSA and North America. 
Continued focus and discipline in the management of working  
capital resulted in an inflow of £4.8 million (2016: outflow £3.1m).  
This constitutes a strong 61% free cash flow conversion creating  
a solid platform for investing in growth and paying dividends.

We have continued our strategy of making selective bolt-on 
acquisitions where the returns and strategic fit justify the investment, 
and we completed nine such investments in the year, three in our 
North American division and six in ALSA. Total cash consideration  
for these acquisitions, net of cash and debt held, was £52.5 million 
with a further £75.0 million of consideration deferred into future 
 years. £49.0 million of deferred consideration relating to acquisitions 
completed in prior years was settled in 2017, resulting in a total net 
funds outflow in the period of £101.5 million. We continue to deliver 
strong performances from our acquisitions, delivering returns on 
invested capital of at least 15% in the first full year after acquisition.
Net funds flow for the period was an outflow of £9.9 million (2016: 
outflow £132.5m), resulting in year-end net debt of £887.9 million.  
Dividend
National Express’ dividend policy, agreed in 2015, is for dividend 
cover at normalised earnings per share of at least two times.  
In considering the level of the dividend to declare, the Board 
considers three principal factors, in addition to level of cover:
1. Available distributable reserves
2. In-year free cash flow generation
3. Company gearing and indebtedness
With £290 million of distributable reserves, strong free cash flow  
of £146.4 million and gearing reduced to 2.3 times, and in line with  
the interim dividend, the Board has proposed a 10% increase in  
the final dividend to 9.25p, to give a full year dividend of 13.51p  
at 2.2 times cover.  
Treasury management
The Group maintains a prudent approach to its financing and is 
committed to an investment grade credit rating. The Board’s policy 
targets a level of debt that allows for disciplined investment and ample 
headroom on its covenants, with net debt to EBITDA at a ratio of  
2.0x to 2.5x in the medium-term. The Group continues to maintain 
investment grade ratings with both Moody’s and Fitch.
The Group’s key accounting debt ratios at 31 December 2017 were 
as follows:
 – Gearing ratio: 2.3 times EBITDA (31 Dec 2016: 2.5x; bank covenant 
not to exceed 3.5x);
 – Interest cover ratio: EBITDA 10.2 times interest (31 Dec 2016: 6.6x; 
bank covenant not to be less than 3.5x).
To underpin delivery of its strategy, the Group has a strong funding 
platform across a diversified range of funding sources with a 
balanced maturity profile. Through 2017, the Group has put in place  
a number of new facilities, further diversifying the sources of funding 
and providing additional liquidity until 2020 in a low interest rate 
environment. In July 2017, the Group entered into a $130 million  
term loan maturing in April 2018. In November 2017, the Group issued 
a €250 million 2.5 year Floating Rate Note (FRN) maturing in 2020  
with a coupon of Euribor +40bps, representing the Group’s debut 
issuance in the Eurobond market. In December 2017, the Group 
entered into an additional unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) 
totalling £32 million. This new facility is on the same terms as the 
Group’s £512 million of bank facilities and matures in November 2021.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had £1.7 billion of debt capital  
and committed facilities, comprised of the $130 million term loan 
maturing in April 2018, a £225 million Sterling bond and the €250 
million FRN both maturing in 2020; a private placement of €78 million 
maturing in 2021; £544 million of RCF maturing in 2021; a £400 million  
Sterling bond maturing in 2023 and £173 million of finance leases.  
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s RCF was undrawn with £858 
million in cash and undrawn committed facilities available.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had foreign currency debt and 
swaps held as net investment hedges. These help mitigate volatility  
in foreign currency profit translation with corresponding movements  
in the Sterling value of debt. These corresponded to 1.9x EBITDA 
earned in the US, held in US Dollars, and 2.4x EBITDA earned in 
Spain and Germany, held in Euros. The Group hedges its exposure to 
interest rate movements to maintain an appropriate balance between 
fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings. It has therefore 
entered into a series of swaps that have the effect of converting fixed 
rate debt to floating rate debt. The net effect of these transactions 
was that, at 31 December 2017, the proportion of Group debt at 
floating rates was 43% (2016: 24%).
Group tax policy
We pursue a cautious approach to our tax affairs which are aligned to 
business transactions and economic activity. We have a constructive 
and good working relationship with the various tax authorities in the 
countries in which we operate and there are no outstanding tax audits 
in any of our main three markets of the UK, Spain and the US.
The Group’s tax strategy has been published on the Group website  
in accordance with recent UK tax law.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 22 Group Finance Director’s review With £290 million of distributable reserves, 
strong free cash flow of £146.4 million and 
gearing reduced to 2.3 times, and in line 
with the interim dividend, the Board has 
proposed a 10% increase in the final 
dividend to give a full year dividend of 
13.51p at 2.2 times covered. 
Pensions
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension schemes are all in the 
UK. The combined deficit under IAS 19 at 31 December 2017 was 
£94.5 million (Dec 2016: £88.2m).
During the year, the principal UK Rail defined benefit scheme was 
transferred to Trenitalia as part of the disposal of NXET Trains Limited 
on 10 February 2017. In addition, with effect from 30 June 2017, the 
assets and liabilities of the Tayside Transport Fund (a defined benefit 
pension scheme for certain past and present employees of Tayside 
Public Transport Company Limited, a subsidiary of the UK Bus 
division) were transferred into the Tayside Pension Fund (a fund 
administered by Dundee City Council).
The two principal plans are the UK Group scheme, which closed to 
new accrual in 2011, and the West Midlands Bus plan, which remains 
open to accrual for existing active members only. We have completed 
the triennial valuation of both schemes and expect that the overall 
level of deficit contributions will remain at around £10 million in total 
per annum until 2020.
The IAS 19 valuations for the principal schemes at 31 December 2017 
were as follows:
 – WM Bus: £133.8 million deficit (2016: £128.5m deficit);
 – UK Group scheme: £43.2 million surplus (2016: £44.5m surplus)
Fuel costs
The Group consumes approximately 225 million litres of fuel each 
year for which it is at risk (ie there is no direct fuel escalator in the 
contract or concession price). Fuel costs represented a total cost  
to the Group in 2017 of £178 million (approximately 8% of related 
revenue), at an average fuel component cost (ie excluding delivery 
and taxes) of 44.4 pence per litre. The Group has adopted a forward 
fuel buying policy in order to secure a degree of certainty in its 
planning. This policy is to hedge fully a minimum of 15 months 
addressable consumption against movements in price of the 
underlying commodity, together with at least 50% of the next nine 
months’ consumption in the contract businesses. Currently, the 
Group is 100% fixed for 2018 at an average price of 34.3 pence per 
litre, 75% fixed for 2019 at an average price of 33.8p and 42% fixed 
for 2020 at 32.9p. Based on this, year-on-year fuel costs for the  
same mileage will be around £20 million less in 2018.
Where businesses have the freedom to price services, this hedge 
provides sufficient protection to recover fuel price increases through 
the fare basket. In contract businesses, where price escalation  
may be restricted by a formula independent of fuel costs, extended 
cover may be taken, subject to availability and liquidity in the  
hedging market. 
Impact of new accounting standards  
– IFRS 9, 15 and 16 
Three new accounting standards are to be introduced, two of which 
came into effect on 1 January 2018 (IFRS 9 and IFRS 15), with the 
third, IFRS 16, coming into effect on 1 January 2019.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ addresses accounting for our financial 
assets and financial liabilities. As part of this, it introduces new rules 
for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial 
assets. The Group has reviewed its existing financial assets and 
liabilities accounting and expects to make a number of transitional 
adjustments, including an increase in the impairment provision for 
trade and other receivables.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is based on the 
principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service 
transfers to a customer. We have reviewed a sample of contracts from 
across the Group and do not envisage a material impact from the 
adoption of this standard.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will primarily effect the accounting for the Group’s 
operating leases and will result in an increase in the number of leases 
being recognised on the balance sheet as the distinction between 
operating and finance leases is removed. The new standard will be 
adopted on 1 January 2019. An assessment of the impact is ongoing 
and we will formally conclude on this in 2018.
See note 2 of the financial statements in the Annual Report 2017  
for further detail of the new accounting standards.
Summary
The strong financial performance delivered in 2017, coupled with the 
additional financing facilities and continued prudent balance sheet 
management, further augment the Group’s robust financial position. 
We remain confident about the prospects for the year ahead.

ALSA is the leading company in the Spanish road 
passenger transport sector, and was acquired  
by National Express in 2005.
With over 100 years’ experience, it operates long-
distance, regional and urban bus and coach services 
across Spain and in Morocco and Switzerland. Apart from 
its bus and coach services, the business also operates 
service areas and other transport-related businesses, 
such as fuel distribution.

Market overview
ALSA holds the market-leading position in the regulated and 
highly segmented bus and intercity coach market in Spain  
and also operates in four cities in Morocco. Three levels of 
government regulation apply in Spain: national (long-distance 
coach), regional (regional coach) and city (urban bus). Each 
concession is exclusive to the operator, based on compliance 
with the public service obligation. Intercity competition comes 
from state-backed rail and low-cost airlines. Bus and coach 
concessions are awarded through competitive public tender, 
typically every ten years.
 – 176 concessions: 125 intercity coach concessions, 35 urban 
bus contracts, 16 others

Revenue €757.4 €731.2
Normalised operating profit €108.3 €103.7
Normalised operating margin 14.3% 14.2%
ALSA has delivered another strong performance, growing normalised 
operating profit to €108.3 million (up 4.4% in constant currency), 
increasing its margin and carrying more passengers (313.8 million,  
up 2.1%) while at the same time improving its customer satisfaction 
score (up 4.8% year-on-year).
Technology investment has again underpinned these results, with  
our sophisticated, real-time Revenue Management System (RMS) 
particularly important. We will continue to invest in RMS as it 
becomes more sophisticated through time, and complement this with 
the roll out of Lytx DriveCam, speed monitoring and further customer 
service improvements.
Concession renewal is a key challenge over the next few years, 
 but with our technology investment and industry-leading customer 
service, the announced scoring methodology changes which place 
greater emphasis on quality over price, means we are well-placed. 
The main concession renewal process has been further delayed and 
we now do not expect any profit impact in 2018 at all, and a minimal 
impact in 2019. However, we anticipate the renewal process will 
resume shortly, with some smaller contracts due for re-bid first and  
a larger contract delayed at least until later this year. While we expect 
margins will be compressed as new franchises begin, we believe that 
ALSA is very well placed to compete effectively through the 
concession renewal process and grow revenues and earnings 
through the medium and long term.
ALSA is also an increasingly diversified business. There are already 
clear benefits from the acquisitions made in 2016, with AlpyBus in 
particular performing very well, and they are opening new growth 
markets for us. We have augmented these opportunities with further 
acquisitions in 2017 and again see a strong pipeline of further

Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 24 Business review: ALSA Operational excellence
Already widely recognised as the industry leader, ALSA consolidated 
its reputation with a number of important awards to complement its 
record customer satisfaction score. Among other awards in 2017, 
ALSA received: IZO’s ‘Best Customer Experience for the Transport 
Sector’; and the ‘International Safety Award’ and ‘Best Initiative in  
the Prevention of Accidents’ from the MAPFRE Foundation. ALSA’s 
Spanish operations also received a five-star accreditation from the 
European Foundation for Quality Management.
Our excellence has also importantly been recognised in concession 
renewals during 2017. ALSA won the Madrid-Guadalajara contract  
on quality, not price: scoring 34 out of 35 on quality while finishing 
third on price. This is both pleasing in itself and significant given the 
transport ministry’s announced changes to the concession renewal 
methodology that emphasises quality over price.
ALSA also reversed Morocco’s revenue decline in the first half of the 
year by – among other actions – offering innovative new fares and 
products, to deliver growth in the year as a whole.
Deployment of technology
RMS is allowing ALSA to target its pricing to the market in a much 
more granular and accurate manner. On the long haul routes where  
it is operational we have seen revenues increase by 3.9%, passenger 
numbers grow by 1.9% and average ticket prices increase by 1.9%,  
in 2017. It has also helped drive efficiency, with occupancy rates 
across ALSA up two percent. ALSA project that RMS will also  
deliver incremental revenue growth of around one percent in 2018.
ALSA also continues to grow significantly its proportion of sales  
made through digital channels – they now account for over 40% of 
sales (up over 9% year-on-year). Continuing to draw on best practice 
across the Group, ALSA has invested further in targeted, digital 
marketing and also launched a number of foreign language apps  
to serve the in-bound tourist market.
ALSA is also using technology to drive up standards and has started 
installing DriveCam smart safety cameras, aiming to have over 1,000 
(around 45% of the Spanish fleet) by the end of 2018. Additionally,  
by the end of March, all their vehicles will have speed monitoring 
technology installed, supporting a Group-wide campaign to reduce  
its incidence and enhance driving standards and training.
ALSA successfully piloted a new service – ALSACab – in Madrid 
where a customer buying a bus ticket through digital channels could 
also order a cab trip to complete their journey. The pilot has been 
successful with the service already expanded to Santander and  
ALSA looking to launch it in other cities soon.
Creating new opportunities
ALSA has also benefited from the acquisitions made in 2016,  
during 2017. AlpyBus is in particular performing very well and three 
further acquisitions have been made to augment this and extend  
our operations in the Geneva area. This has included both new 
business acquired in the ski-transfer market and also in school bus 
and discretionary travel, as we seek to develop a larger presence  
in this market.
A further three acquisitions were made in 2017, adding new services 
in Madrid and Granada to our expanding portfolio. Our strategy 
remains the same: remain disciplined and target returns above 15%. 
We saw a number of new contracts start in 2017: an up to seven year 
bus and sightseeing train contract in Tenerife; new urban bus services 
in Lorca, Murcia; and bus rapid transit services and sightseeing tours 
in Marrakech, Morocco.
ALSA has recently established a joint venture – which also involves 
our UK coach business as well as Ouibus – to offer new international 
services across selected European countries. They have also 
submitted a bid with a local joint venture partner for a 400 bus 
contract in Rabat, to consolidate our presence in Morocco.
We will continue to look to drive organic revenue growth in 2018,  
as RMS and our marketing become ever-more sophisticated.  
There remain good opportunities to complement this through further 
acquisitions and growth in Morocco and Geneva. While we do not 
expect any impact on profits in 2018 and only a marginal effect in 
2019 from the concession renewal process, it is very likely to put 
pressure on margins as it progresses. However, through our 
increasingly sophisticated pricing and market diversification, we 
believe we are well placed to compete strongly for our own – and 
other contract – renewals and can manage the pressure on margins 
to grow revenue and earnings in the medium and long term.

School Bus and Transit
North America
Our business in North America has two areas of activity: 
student transportation and transit services. 
We operate in 38 US states and three Canadian provinces. 
The student transportation business operates through 
medium-term contracts awarded by local school boards 
to provide safe and reliable transport for students, and  
is the second largest private operator in North America.
Our transit business operates a growing number of transit 
and paratransit services across the USA.

Market overview
National Express is the second largest player in the North 
American school bus market with a 13% share of the outsourced 
market. Just over a third of the market is outsourced with recent 
increases in outsource conversion being driven by pressure on 
public funding. This trend is likely to continue as school district 
budgets remain constrained. Typically customers are local 
school boards where local relationships are key and service 
delivery is very important. 
National Express also operates in the North American public 
transit market and is the fourth largest player with around 4% 
market share. One third of the transit market is outsourced  
and there is an increasing demand for accessible public 
transportation services, for fixed route, paratransit and  
employee shuttle services.

Overview of 2017
North America is now a fundamentally different business to five  
years ago. It is consistently delivering growth by embedding a  
culture of customer service, efficiency and technological investment 
across the business. As well as identifying and integrating high-return 
businesses, it is opening new avenues of growth. We see significant 
opportunity for growth in charter markets, and are developing a  
new model in major cities where we operate a number of different 
local services.

The terrible accident in Chattanooga in November 2016 is a  
tragedy that still weighs very heavily on us all. We have sought to  
learn any appropriate lessons and as described in this section, have 
accelerated enhanced safety measures such as Lytx DriveCam and 
speed monitoring. We continue to co-operate with all the relevant 
authorities, including the ongoing National Transportation Safety 
Board investigation. We have donated to local community groups  
and funded a new home being built through Habitat for Humanity.  
We continue to provide support to the families affected by the 
tragedy. Last year, we had our local school bus contract renewed  
and received the Federal Motor Carrier Administration’s highest  
safety rating for our national operations.
Operational excellence
The benefits of our approach so far are reflected in another record 
year of normalised operating profit (up 6.6% to $121.6 million) and a 
revenue increase of 10.1% to $1.31 billion (both in constant currency). 
Our North American business has delivered industry-leading margins 
for a number of years and has had to absorb the ongoing pressure 
from driver wages for some time now. In 2017, driver wage inflation 
increased to five percent, leading to a reduction in our normalised 
operating margin to 9.3% (2016: 9.6%).
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 26 Business review: North America We managed to contain this margin reduction through cost discipline 
across the business, including $10 million of cost savings, and our 
prudent bidding. We maintained strong retention rates (96% of those 
school bus contracts we wanted to retain) and achieved an average  
of three percent price increases on renewal or retention, or above two 
percent across the whole portfolio. Our focus on service and strong 
local relationships, with customer satisfaction scores again above 
90%, has helped deliver these results.
This was augmented by our continued ‘up or out’ strategy,  
to ensure that we focused on only retaining contracts that are  
delivering acceptable returns. We relinquished contracts amounting 
to 190 buses in 2017 – and also exited our first transit contract for  
this reason as well in the year – and will maintain this discipline in 
2018. So far, early bidding this year has been very positive, with our 
most successful January for contract retention and new business 
wins in four years, and above inflation price increases secured.

Deployment of technology
Technology investment is playing an increasingly important role  
in our determination to drive efficiency, improve standards and  
deliver growth.
Our investment in DriveCam smart safety cameras is continuing 
apace, with 6,351 vehicles already fitted in North America, and a 
target of around another 10,000 installed by the end of the year.  
We are already recording a significant reduction in the cost of 
preventable accidents after DriveCam has been installed. Over 90% 
of our vehicles also have the necessary technology installed to enable 
enhanced speed management to take place. This is an increasingly 
important area of our safety management, with a high profile internal 
campaign being launched shortly.
We are also investing in new business management systems to  
drive improved standards and efficiency. A new budget management 
system and a business management system both allow very detailed 
analysis for local management use but also central review. 
Fundamentally, we are aspiring to use these new technologies and 
systems to industrialise service excellence and cost efficiency across 
the business, with enhanced central management oversight and 
assurance married with good local management and customer 
relationships. This will not only deliver more, happier customers but 
also support a relentless pursuit of safety and service improvement, 
organic growth and cost efficiency.
We started rolling DriveCam out in 2014 and it is now installed  
in 46 locations. The results so far show that when comparing the 
costs of claims from preventable street accidents for the 12 months 
prior to fitment against post-installation, there has been a 30% 
reduction. The business management system has already been  
used to revise our fleet management systems and has helped identify 
over 750 buses that can be deployed more effectively. This alone will 
provide meaningful capital savings.
We continue to grow our Ecolane acquisition, a market leader in 
on-demand scheduling technology. In 2017, Ecolane installed the 
United States’ first cloud-based state-wide paratransit software, in 
Pennsylvania and won 24 new contracts in its specialist field in 2017. 
Ecolane is also increasingly becoming a key credential in our other 
North American bids and we are exploring its broader application 
across the Group.
Creating new opportunities
North America remains a very attractive market for further 
acquisitions. The market is very fragmented – with over 1,000  
private school bus businesses in the US alone – and we have a  
strong pipeline of opportunities. There are very few active buyers  
in the market and we continue to avoid becoming involved in an 
auction for a business.
In line with this strategy we acquired another three businesses in 
North America last year, all in the last six months. These were: a 
significant paratransit operator in Chicago, the US’ largest paratransit 
market; a school bus and charter operator in Cincinnati, Ohio; and a 
school bus business (specialising in special education services) in 
Rochester, New York. Together they amount to over 800 additional 
vehicles and we continue to target at least 15% returns from these 
new acquisitions.
Our transit business grew 60% in 2017, with annualised revenues now 
around $300 million. This is significant growth for a business that has 
only been in place for five years. We won five new contracts in 2017, 
at a win rate of 33%, and have already secured our first contract win 
of 2018.
We see the opportunity for significant nationwide growth in the 
charter market. We estimate there to be at least a $1.5 billion 
annualised market available and National Express only captured 
around 3% of it in 2017.
We have now developed credentials in a number of sectors within 
North American transport. Drawing on the lessons of our most 
successful markets, we are building opur presence in the largest 
cities. By running a mix of school bus, transit, paratransit, charter  
and employee shuttle services, we have the opportunity to more 
effectively offer competitive pricing and operational excellence, 
alongside developing strong local relationships, and generate new 
growth centres in North America. So while we will continue to  
pursue acquisitions in North America, we also see exciting growth 
opportunities in these emerging new models.
While the bid season still has some months yet to run, I am  
pleased that the early indications suggest that competitors are  
being disciplined in their bidding. Our focus in 2018 will be to recover 
the wage inflation we suffered in 2017 through a combination of 
disciplined bidding, overhead reductions and further cost efficiencies.

Bus and Coach
UK
National Express operates both bus and coach services 
in the UK. In Bus, National Express is the market leader in 
the West Midlands – the largest urban bus market outside 
of London. We also run urban bus services in the cities  
of Coventry and Dundee. In Coach, we are the largest 
operator of scheduled coach services in the UK, 
operating high frequency services linking more than  
900 destinations across the country. The Kings Ferry  
and Clarkes of London are long-established providers  
of private hire and commuter coach travel services  
in the South East.

Market overview – Bus
The largest five operators represent around 70% of the UK 
deregulated bus market, with the remainder of the market made 
up of a large number of private operators. Active competition 
comes from national and local bus operators, as well as private 
car and rail. Economic regeneration and environmentally driven 
public transport present growth opportunities over the car.
 – Increase passenger volumes through investment in vehicles, 
technology and people through delivering high quality services
Market overview – Coach
Our Coach business has the only nationwide network of 
services, with other competitors tending to focus on specific 
regions or corridors. Selective competition comes from rail, 
particularly on discounted fares, and from large bus operators 
and localised services. Drivers for demand include the level of 
fare discount to rail, cost of private motoring and environmental 
friendliness. Customer satisfaction is also an important driver for 
longer-term loyalty through consistent service and high customer 
safety standards.

Overview
Following our exit from UK rail in 2017, we restructured management 
across our remaining bus and coach businesses, combining the 
senior functions to operate as a combined team. We therefore 
present our UK operations together for the first time, as a new 
combined division. We have also included the separate bus and 
coach data in this transition year.
In the UK we employed sophisticated pricing, network efficiency and 
disciplined cost management to reverse the declines we reported  
at the 2017 half year results. In a challenging year, the division grew 
normalised operating profits 5.3% in the year, with the combined 
margin improving to 12.6% (2016: 12.1%).
These headline figures can obscure the detail of the particularly 
impressive recovery in both our UK bus and coach businesses  
as management action addressed the challenges they faced:
 – Bus: West Midlands like-for-like commercial passengers declined 
by 0.7% in the first half of the year; in the second half of the year 
they bounced back to record 0.7% growth;
 – In Coach, the year-on-year revenues for each quarter were: 1.9%  
up (Q1); 2.3% down (Q2); 0.8% down (Q3); and, 2.3% up (Q4)  
(Q1 and Q2 have been normalised for Easter).
During the year, we concluded an asset sale and leaseback 
transaction, monetising the value in one of our coach depots  
and booking a profit of £2.5m.

Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 28 Business review: UK Our first two West Midlands Low Fare Zones (LFZ) have successfully 
driven bus passenger (4%) and revenue growth (1.5%). In 2017 our 
LFZs covered around 28% of our commercial patronage and continue 
to be successful in 2018. Our bus business has delivered broadly  
flat revenue overall, while running 1.5% fewer commercial miles.  
This translates to an improved revenue per mile in the West Midlands 
of 1.6% and overall normalised operating margin growth of 100  
basis points.
We have also worked with the Mayor of the West Midlands and 
Transport for West Midlands to establish a credible plan to tackle 
congestion and promote bus prioritisation. Demonstrating the 
importance of strong relationships, we are delighted that our joint  
bid to the Department for Transport for bus lanes on the key 
Harborne to Birmingham city centre route was successful. We have 
already started operating our state-of-the-art Platinum buses on this 
route, with the prioritisation work due to start shortly. Our experience 
shows that where we have introduced Platinum buses and faster 
routes before, such as Lode Lane, we have seen double digit 
patronage growth.

Our coach operations used RMS to drive core revenues and increase 
passenger numbers. Our sophisticated real-time pricing generated an 
incremental two percent of revenue growth in 2017 and helped 
increase core passenger numbers by nearly one percent. New routes, 
especially to airports, generated an additional one percent of revenue 
growth and when combined with the RMS benefits, helped offset the 
revenue decline attributable to terrorism (-3%).
The coach business also focused on the efficiency of their operation 
and removed 3 million route miles from the network. Combined with 
the benefit of RMS already noted, this increased coach occupancy 
rates by two percent and drove revenue per mile up by 5.5% during 
2017. We believe there is more opportunity to come, with RMS likely 
to generate a further incremental revenue benefit of one percent in 
2018 and additional network optimisation opportunities to pursue.
Both our UK bus and coach operations have received significant 
external operational excellence recognition in 2017: both hold five-star 
British Safety Council ratings, as well as the Sword of Honour, the 
safety council’s highest accolade; both recorded improved customer 
satisfaction scores – 87% in bus, up 1% year-on-year; 86% in coach, 
up 3% year-on-year; and, both hold five-star European Foundation  
for Quality Management awards.
Deployment of technology
The importance of RMS to our coach operations has already been 
covered; the importance of new technology in enabling us to innovate 
further in our bus pricing is becoming increasingly apparent. As we 
look to build on the success of the LFZs, we roll out new ticketing 
products in bus. From near zero usage at the start of the year, 10%  
of all journeys on our bus services are now by m-ticket. We have 
introduced the latest contactless ticketing machines to our bus  
fleet. Customers in Coventry are already using and benefiting from 
them, with daily capping a key feature. These machines will be fully 
operational across the West Midlands in April, making it the single 
largest contactless network outside of London. This crucial 
technology not only responds to a customer demand, but also 
enables us to offer new, targeted pricing through a range of payment 
methods rather than the exact change fare that frustrates passengers.
Our coach website – www.nationalexpressgroup.com – and customer 
app now provide 66% of all sales revenue (up 3% year-on-year). We 
therefore invested in 2017 to make them easier and quicker to use. 
The benefit is seen in both the improved online conversion rates,  
up 1.5 percentage points to 18.5% and an App Store rating of 4.5  
(up from 2.5 at the start of the year).
We have also invested in technology to improve our safety 
performance. All our vehicles in the UK are fitted with Lytx DriveCam 
smart safety cameras. All of our UK fleet is fitted with GPS technology 
allowing detailed speed management and monitoring. Alongside 
enhanced management and training programmes, we anticipate 
these technologies will deliver both improved driving performance 
and cost savings through reduced accidents.
Creating new opportunities
With the investment in improved sales channels and on-board 
ticketing, alongside a continued focus on efficiency and customer 
service, we anticipate organic revenue growth in the UK during 2018.
During 2017 we set a new record for the most revenue raised and 
passengers carried in a day on our coach services: Boxing Day saw 
revenue exceed £1.3 million and around 75,000 passengers carried. 
Our Glastonbury Festival services also secured their highest ever 
revenues. We also won a contract to transport Amazon employees  
to and from work and have signed new partnerships with, amongst 
others, The Jockey Club and BoomTown Fair Festival.
Our acquisition of Clarkes has performed well, achieved the targeted 
synergies and demonstrated a resilience to the impact of the terrorist 
attacks in London. We anticipate this will continue to grow our 
presence in Kent and Medway commuter services as well as the 
in-bound tourist and discretionary travel markets. We have also taken 
the opportunity to exit operations during 2017 – Hotel Hoppa and the 
Eurolines network – that were underperforming. We made a small 
profit on the sale of Hotel Hoppa and have entered a new joint venture 
with ALSA and Ouibus to provide coach services across selected 
European locations.
In 2018, we expect that our sophisticated approach to pricing will 
drive further revenue growth. We expect RMS to provide an 
incremental revenue benefit of one percent in coach. And by moving 
away from a traditional annual (largely cash) fare increase in UK bus, 
to more agile and targeted pricing – including fare cuts – we also 
expect to generate revenue growth. This is being complemented  
in both bus and coach by investment in technology to make our 
ticketing portals and services easier to access and also encourage 
loyalty and frequency of use among existing customers. We are 
optimistic about our prospects in the UK for 2018.
Germany
Our German rail services continue to perform strongly. 2017 
saw a significant increase in revenue (20.4%) and normalised 
operating profit (€7.7 million) in part due to a recognition of 
revenues we were unable to include in the 2016 accounts.  
They have been profitable from their first full year of operation 
and we believe will continue to deliver typical rail margins in  
the future. 
Our Rhine Münster Express services grew passengers by 
nearly one percent in 2017 despite significant track maintenance 
disruption. We continue to focus on delivering improved 
customer service and operational performance and launched 
‘NX-Scout’ during 2017. ‘NX-Scout’ is a WhatsApp group 
which provides up-to-date travel information for customers, 
and has the equivalent of around 15% of daily passengers 
already signed up.
Our mobilisation for our Rhine Ruhr Express contracts is well 
advanced, ahead of the first services staring in June 2019.  
We will continue to submit further bids this year as we look  
to build our presence in Germany.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 29 Business review: UK Our Vision and Values 
drive our ambition
Our Vision and Values
Our Vision and Values have been in place for a number of years 
now and guide how we operate. They are a fundamental statement 
of who we are as a business and as our Chief Executive repeatedly 
reminds us: are crucial to our future success. 
Our Vision is to earn the lifetime loyalty of our customers by 
consistently delivering frequent, high performing public transport 
services which offer excellent value. 
Our Values guide how we deliver this Vision.
Our Low Fare Zones in our UK bus 
business have bucked national trends and 
radically cut some fares and generated 
significant passenger growth where they 
have been implemented. 
Excellence
As a business we recognise that our ability to please our existing 
customers and attract new ones, is dependent upon us delivering  
the services they want at prices they can afford. 
Although we have invested in a number of acquisitions in recent years, 
we remain focused on driving organic growth within our business.  
We will only do this by attracting more passengers and customers by 
running the services they want at prices they value, in an efficient way. 
In short, by achieving operational excellence, day-in, day-out.
This is why we have an Excellence value and it requires us to 
‘constantly strive to be excellent in all that we do.’
These are not just words: the business’ commitment to excellence  
and industry-leading performance is reflected in the investment and 
initiatives outlined under the other Values. It is also evident in the fact 
that we carried more passengers in our UK coach and ALSA operations 
in 2017, driven by our Revenue Management Systems that allow 
sophisticated and targeted pricing for passengers in real-time. Equally, 
our Low Fare Zones in our UK bus business have bucked national 
trends and radically cut some fares and generated significant 
passenger growth where they have been implemented. 
Indeed, overall in 2017 we carried over 882 million passengers,  
up 1.2% on a continuing basis, on 2016.
This nimble and granular approach is entirely in line with our Vision of 
earning the lifetime loyalty of our customers by consistently delivering 
frequent, high performing public transport services which offer excellent 
value. It is also at the heart of our excellence value and we believe the 
way that we will drive growth and improve returns for shareholders.
It is pleasing therefore that our excellence was also recognised by 
outside bodies and organisations. Among many awards, Kings Ferry 
won the Large Fleet Operator of the Year award at the UK Coach 
Awards. Our customer service and safety awards are set out below. 
And our UK bus, coach and ALSA’s Spanish operations now hold a 
five-star European Foundation for Quality Management accreditation, 
one of the world’s leading excellence accreditation bodies.
Last year we introduced our Delivering Excellence programme.  
We are now able to report on a full year of the programme. Delivering 
Excellence is designed to help fully embed a culture of excellence across 
the Group by drawing on examples of best practice both within our 
existing businesses and also adopting them from external organisations. 
It also combines as a development opportunity for high-potential 
managers with them spending up to six months to interrogate specific 
business practices and make recommendations for improvement. 
In 2017, the Delivering Excellence teams conducted detailed reviews of 
driver recruitment, training, management and utilisation. These reviews 
have resulted in the introduction of new Group-wide standard operating 
excellence procedures and also generated savings for each business’ 
2018 budget. This programme will continue in 2018 with new intakes  
of high-potential managers and new projects.

Safety
We make no apologies for repeating every year that safety remains 
the highest priority for our business. It is the first agenda item for 
weekly executive team calls, all executive boards and the PLC Board. 
Overall responsibility for safety sits with Dean Finch, Group Chief 
Executive, and our Divisional Managing Directors who set our annual 
plans and priorities for improved performance. We have also retained 
Arthur D Little as our independent external safety advisers.
We have 12 Global Safety Standards which set out the clear 
behaviours and minimum standards which we expect all our staff  
to demonstrate at all times. During 2017, we also enhanced these 
standards with five new Global Safety Policies:
 – Speed management
 – Driving evaluation
 – Competency of driving evaluators
 – Driver monitoring
 – Driver performance management
Each of these new policies targets critical areas for further improvement 
in our safety performance. Each division has until 2020 to devise 
comprehensive plans to deliver against them in full. Many are already 
making good progress on a number of them. Performance and 
implementation is reviewed in a quarterly meeting of Managing 
Directors chaired by Dean Finch.
We are pleased that we have delivered significant improvements on 
our industry-leading safety measure: Fatalities and Weighted Injuries 
(FWI) index. As Figure 2 demonstrates, since the introduction of 
Driving Out Harm in 2010, we have seen a 74% reduction in our FWI 
score per million miles operated. The annual figures are reported in 
our KPI section on page 13. During 2017, senior managers conducted 
697 safety tours across the Group (2016: 774). The lower number of 
tours last year compared to 2016 is as a result of the sale of the c2c 
rail franchise in February 2017.
We have also invested in industry-leading safety technology to help  
us achieve our objective of removing all responsible harm from our 
business. Lytx DriveCam smart safety cameras are an example of 
this. The cameras are now fully installed across our UK fleet. We have 
accelerated installation programmes in place in North America and 
ALSA: North America has 6,351 vehicles with the cameras and 
targets around another 10,000 by the end of the year; ALSA has  
150 vehicles installed, with a target of over 1,000 (around 45%  
of the Spanish fleet) by the end of the year. 
Technology is, however, only part of the resource required to improve 
safety standards. We have comprehensive management systems  
in place to use the data generated by these smart cameras to tailor 
training and improve overall standards. We are already seeing 
encouraging early reductions in ‘event severity’, where the smart 
safety cameras have been in place the longest. So with the significant 
further roll out programme in 2018, we expect to reap further driving 
standards, safety and cost benefits over the next couple of years.
Our safety performance and leadership are also receiving significant 
external recognition. Both UK bus and coach received five-star British 
Safety Council scores, and their highest honour, the Sword of Honour. 
Indeed, our UK bus operations’ score of 97.4% was the highest in the 
transport industry. Our UK coach business also received a ROSPA 
Gold Award. ALSA received two awards from MAPFE: the 
‘International Road Safety’ and ‘Best Initiative in the Prevention of 
Accidents’ awards. Our North American school bus business has 
again received the highest possible safety rating from the Federal 
Motor Carrier Administration. 
In the aftermath of the tragedy in Chattanooga in November 2016,  
we have sought to learn any appropriate lessons and also take 
considerate actions in the local community. We have, of course, 
continued to support the families of those involved as well as 
co-operate with all the relevant authorities, including the ongoing 
National Transportation Safety Board investigation. In the local 
community we have donated to local groups and funded a new  
home being built through Habitat for Humanity.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 31 Resources, relationships and responsibilities Customers
As our Vision makes clear, customers are at the heart of our business. 
This is as it should be: we are a public transport company. But 
delivering against this Value also shapes the types of services we 
operate. It has not always been true that public transport companies 
operated services their passengers wanted. Rather, there was a 
culture in some places of running the services the operator found 
most convenient and customer demand was an afterthought.
This is why it is particularly pleasing that our businesses have again 
demonstrated their industry-leading customer service credentials in 
the year. Both our UK bus business and ALSA have achieved record 
customer satisfaction scores in 2017. UK bus’ customer satisfaction 
score of 87% in the independent Transport Focus survey was up 1% 
year-on-year and equalled their best-ever result. ALSA’s 7.4 out of  
10 was up 4.8% year-on-year and a new record. ALSA also won the 
IZO ‘Best Customer Experience for the Transport Industry’ award,  
the largest satisfaction survey conducted in Spain. 
North America has now consistently delivered customer satisfaction 
scores above 90% for many years; this year it achieved 91.2%.  
Our UK coach business’ customer satisfaction score was up three 
percent to 86%, with the independent Temkin Group Net Promoter 
Score index ranking National Express fourth in its select group  
of companies. 
We are also investing to further modernise our services for our 
customers’ benefit. We have started to roll out the largest contactless 
ticketing network in the UK, outside of London: our West Midlands 
bus services will have this system fully in place in April. It is clear that 
a significant – and growing – number of passengers prefer these new 
methods of payment compared to the correct cash fare required 
previously. In the last year alone, the number of journeys made using 
an m-Ticket on one of our West Midlands buses went from virtually 
zero to 10% by the end of 2017.
We are also investing in our websites and customer apps.  
www.nationalexpress.com is now the highest placed land 
transportation company website on Google’s crucial optimisation 
score ranking system. During 2017, we launched new apps in: North 
American transit, paratransit and school bus; ALSA; and the UK 
coach business. We will be launching new apps across many of our 
other businesses in 2018. Again, this nimbleness and constant review 
of and investment in the effectiveness of our services is at the heart  
of our Vision and Values as a company.
In our UK bus business we have 
started the roll-out of the largest 
contactless ticketing network  
in the UK, outside of London
People
We have asked Tom Harris, the ex-Transport Minister and Labour MP, 
to review our delivery against our People Value for the last three 
years. A summary from Tom is included to the right. It is a 
demonstration of our seriousness to our People Value and doing  
all we can to deliver on it for our staff, that we open ourselves up to 
independent critique in this manner. Tom’s three reports can also be 
found on our Group website.
We have led the industry in a number of aspects of our People  
Value. Our Master Driver Programme goes from strength to strength, 
recognising the driving achievements of our staff and serving as an 
excellent engagement programme. Master Driver provides a 
framework to measure the performance of drivers and recognise and 
reward those with impeccable safety and customer service records 
as well as excellent driving skills. Across the Group, we now have  
728 Master Drivers and 903 Advanced Drivers. We have also recently 
created a similar programme for engineers and technicians and will 
be rolling this out in 2018. 
Our commitment to the higher Living Wage Foundation Living Wage is 
long-standing and growing. Our UK coach business will shortly target 
accreditation by the Living Wage Foundation. The UK bus business 
continues to pay the higher Living Wage and receive the Living Wage 
Foundation accreditation. Our policy remains the same across the 
Group as a whole: where widely recognised and understood national 
Living Wages are not in place, we commit to pay at least 10% above 
the prevailing national minimum wage.
We have a number of policies in place to protect the rights of our 
employees. Our Workplace Rights Policy and Human Rights Policy 
have been in place for a number of years and are published on our 
website. We investigate and take appropriate action to deal with any 
alleged breaches of these policies. Wherever our employees choose 
to be represented by unions, we actively seek to maintain 
relationships based on mutual respect and transparency. 
We recognise the importance of the provisions of the Modern Slavery 
Act, which came into effect in 2015. The Group has a zero tolerance 
approach to modern slavery and human trafficking and remains 
committed to strengthening its practices to uphold that approach.  
We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity, and to 
implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls which 
ensure slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in our 
business or supply chains. 
One example of this is our implementation of a new Modern Slavery 
Policy which is published on  our Group  website. Our first Modern 
Slavery Statement, which set out all steps taken by the Group to 
ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our business  
or supply chains, is available on our website. We review the 
effectiveness of the steps we have taken each year and report on 
these in subsequent statements each year. Accordingly, we will be 
publishing a signed copy of the Group’s second Modern Slavery 
Statement on our website during the year.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 32 Resources, relationships and responsibilities Community
Being active in the communities we serve is very important to 
National Express. We are not simply passive providers of services. 
We play a crucial role in supporting the local economy, helping people 
access jobs and see their friends and family. Our staff also live in the 
communities we serve.
The National Express Foundation is a significant and growing part  
of our community activity. In 2017, National Express Group provided 
£150,000 to the foundation. In 2018, this will be doubled to £300,000. 
This significant level of commitment is unique in the transport industry 
and is testament to the seriousness with which National Express 
Group takes its community responsibilities.
The National Express Foundation supports community groups 
working with young people and also students who would otherwise 
be unable to pursue further or higher education because of financial 
challenges. Since 2012, the foundation has supported over 14,200 
people; in 2017 alone, the funding helped nearly 3,000.
Within our divisions there are also many different community 
activities. Some highlights are:
 – UK coach’s Youth Promise, including support to the Prince’s Trust. 
This has involved mentoring, volunteering and hosting work 
experience placements.
 – ALSA supports a number of foundations, including Foundation 
Integra, which supports people with a disability and those who  
are at risk of social exclusion, gain access to a job. 
 – In North America more than 50 depots have held ‘Stuff The Bus’ 
events, filling school buses with donations from employees and the 
local community to support those most in need. 
Our team in Waterbury, Connecticut, were overwhelmed by the response to 
their appeal to help victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. More than 40 
school buses were filled with donations
Independent review of the people value
I have conducted three independent reviews of National Express’ 
People Value. In the first and third years this involved visiting  
a number of locations in North America, Spain and the UK;  
last year I conducted a desktop review. Every year I have had 
free, unencumbered access to any document, person or location 
I have asked to see, talk to or visit. I have been consistently 
impressed by what I have found. National Express is clearly a 
company that places a great emphasis upon its People Value, 
recognising the crucial importance of investing in their staff to 
achieve the high corporate standards to which they aspire.  
All of my reports have made recommendation for further action, 
to provide even greater support and opportunities for staff. I am 
delighted they have been so readily acted upon and commend 
National Express for its commitment and leadership in this area.

It is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical 
manner. As a Group we do not tolerate bribery and corruption and  
are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all 
our business dealings and relationships wherever we operate, and to 
implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter bribery and 
corruption. We have a Group anti-bribery policy which is available  
on our website and last year we implemented a refresh programme, 
which included an e-training module, to remind employees how  
to prevent, detect and report suspicions of bribery through our 
whistleblowing hotline. During the course of this year, we have also 
developed and implemented a revised gifts and hospitality policy to 
give further guidance to employees.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 33 Resources, relationships and responsibilities Environment
Our environmental performance is a key measure for us as a 
business. This is principally for three reasons. First, it is the right thing 
to do. We recognise the crucial importance of climate change and the 
responsibility of all sectors of society in doing all they can to reduce 
their emissions and impact. Second, a company with ever reducing 
emissions and waste is a well-run, efficient company. And third, both 
of the first two points are reflected in our Values. The environment  
is both a community Value, but also relevant to all of the others: 
well-run, and efficient company (excellence, people and customers) 
and reducing harm (safety).
It is because of these considerations that we set such stretching 
targets in 2014. They demonstrate our commitment to our Values,  
to be a good company in the communities we serve and to be an 
efficient operator.
Overview
Against our 2013 baseline, by 2017 we have made excellent progress 
on our traction energy, water and total carbon emissions targets, 
some limited progress on our site energy target, and we have not 
made progress on our waste target.
We are delighted to have again (at the end of 2016) been accredited 
at Gold Standard for The Carbon Saver scheme. This award is made 
for two years and is due for renewal at the end of 2018. A number of 
other awards were earned throughout 2017, particularly in National 
Express West Midlands. We continue to engage staff in delivering 
these targets, with fleet efficiency and improving miles per gallon 
remaining a key deliverable in all divisions. Significant improvements 
continue to be maintained through fleet investment, technology and 
improvement in driving skills. 
We remain committed to working in partnership with our stakeholders 
and partners to mitigate the impact of climate change and the Group 
continues to maintain full environmental legislative compliance, with 
zero prosecutions, enforcement notices or reported violations. 
Driving Excellence in Environmental Performance – KPIs Targets 2014-2017
In 2017 specifically, we made good progress on our performance targets, significantly exceeding our targets for water use and total carbon 
emissions improvement. Traction energy and site energy both reduced year on year from 2016, and while there are still improvements needed 
in site energy, 2017 saw the first year that emissions fell below the baseline year. The accuracy of waste data reporting continues to improve 
and while this indicates a slight increase year on year from 2016, we now have two full years of accurate data from which to base our targets  
for the next KPI period.

KPI performance
Our Group environmental performance against a particularly  
robust and ambitious suite of KPIs has delivered some strong  
results. Striving to meet those targets is key but equally important  
is the continued improvement in the accuracy of the data set and 
quality of our reporting. 
The inclusion of UK coach third-party contracts in the data  
collection has continued for 2017, as well as for National Express 
owned operations and combined with the significant reduction  
of estimated data has improved our transparency in reporting. We 
remain committed to meaningful improvement in these areas. Water 
consumption data is now over 80% actual, vs 85% estimated in 2013. 
There is a growth in passenger kilometres of 5.8% YOY 2016 to  
2017 which is accompanied by a decrease in total carbon emissions 
per million passenger kilometres of 7.18% for the same period.  
This demonstrates that focus on improving the ratio of change is a 
meaningful target that should be considered for the next KPI period. 
The targeted reduction in site emissions has not been met. It is 
encouraging however that even with increased consumption and  
the significant growth in our North American division, the Group  
has reported its lowest emissions since 2014, and a 4.36% reduction 
compared to 2016. Total site emissions for the Group excluding North 
America have actually decreased from 22,558 tCO
2
e in 2013 to 
16,353 tCO
2
e in 2017 – a reduction of over 27%. 
It is clear from our performance over this period that the levels of 
non-hazardous waste to landfill need to significantly reduce. Waste 
data has only been available for UK coach for the last two years, and 
with the data set now accurate we must start to demonstrate a real 
improvement in waste stream recycling in the next KPI period.

buses. UK bus has the largest low carbon fleet outside of London.
During 2018, we will retain the same KPI targets while we develop a Phase 2 compliance programme under the UK Government’s Energy 
Savings Opportunity Scheme, as part of a new a three year Property and Environment strategy.  
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 35 Resources, relationships and responsibilities Committed to managing risk effectively
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks that can adversely affect business and financial performance, or potentially damage our reputation. 
These risks may be industry wide or more specific to the Group. The Board recognises that creating shareholder returns is the reward for 
accepting a level of risk. The effective management of risk is therefore critical in supporting the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives.
Risk management framework
The Group has a well-established governance structure with appropriate internal control and risk management systems. Our approach is 
centred on the accepted ‘three lines of defence’ model, with ultimate oversight from the Board.
Defence Responsibility Actions
Oversight Board – Sets strategic objectives
 – Determines overall risk culture and appetite
 – Establishes organisational structure with defined lines of responsibility, 
delegated authorities and clear operating processes
 – Ultimate oversight of internal control and risk  
management systems
Third line Group Audit – Provides reasonable assurance that systems of risk management,  
internal control and governance are effective
Second line Group Executive Committee  
Group functions including Risk
 – Support divisions with ‘first line’ responsibilities
 – Coordinate and report on Group-level risks
 – Build risk capability and understanding
First line Divisional Executive Committees 
Divisional management
 – Identify, assess and report key risks
 – Regularly review and update divisional risk registers
 – Assign risk ‘owners’
 – Implement risk mitigation plans
Many risk controls are embedded and evidenced in the Group’s day-to-day management activities, including:
 – Detailed KPI tracking in monthly divisional executive reports;
 – Well-established bid evaluation controls; and
 – Robust due diligence on acquisitions.
Prioritising and reporting risks
Each division regularly reviews and updates a detailed ‘risk register’, in which risks are identified and assessed in terms of both the  
probability of the risk occurring, and its potential impact. Risk is assessed on a ‘gross’ and ‘net’ basis, taking into account known and 
proposed mitigating actions.
Group-level risks are assessed as:
 – Macro risks which affect the majority of, or all, divisions; or
 – Individual divisional risks where the materiality of the risk is considered of Group significance.
The Group has developed a ‘risk radar’ to supplement the Group risk register, and the radar and register are reported to the Group Executive, 
Audit Committee and Board, twice a year. At both the Divisional and Group level, the consideration of risk includes:
 – Categorisation of risk as Strategic, Financial, Operational or Hazard;
 – New or emerging risks (eg cyber risk, GDPR, Brexit);
 – Longer-term risks such as developments in autonomous vehicles;
 – Latest guidance from the Financial Reporting Council on best practice risk reporting;
 – The impact of the Group’s risk and operations on other stakeholders as well as the Group itself; and 
 – Acknowledgement that many risks are also opportunities (for example, the liberalisation of EU transport markets) and a balance needs  
to be struck in terms of the Group’s risk appetite.
The Group prioritises risk mitigation actions by considering both risk likelihood and potential severity, coupled with our ability to effectively 
intervene to reduce the risk profile – for example, reducing the risk of a safety failure through the implementation of technology and new Group 
safety standards.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 37 Risk and risk management Looking forward, the Group will focus  
on the following key areas of risk: 
Potential impact Management/mitigation
1. Economic conditions, including Brexit implications
Declining economic conditions potentially impact demand for the Group’s 
services in some divisions; improving economic conditions may impact the 
Group’s ability to recruit drivers and other staff, or cause inflationary 
pressure on costs. 
The terms on which Brexit is negotiated (specifically in relation to the means 
by which any limitation on free movement/immigration is traded off against 
access to the single market) may affect the Group’s ability to bid 
competitively within the EU.
The geographical diversification of the Group provides a natural hedge  
to some economic risk. The Group continues to monitor the position 
regarding Brexit. Robust bid modelling takes into account differing 
economic scenarios. Our exit from the UK rail market and focus on 
international opportunities mitigates risk in this area.
2. Political/geopolitical/regulatory landscape
The political and regulatory landscape within which the Group operates is 
constantly changing. Changes to government policy, funding regimes or the 
legal and regulatory framework may result in structural market changes or 
impact the Group’s operations in terms of reduced profitability, increased 
costs and/or a reduction in operational flexibility or efficiency. The Group’s 
exposure to franchise renewal risk in Spain is a specific example. 
The Group constantly monitors the political landscape and is focused on 
effective stakeholder management. Political risk is specifically considered 
when considering bids or new market entry. Strategic alliances and 
partnerships are used where appropriate to mitigate risk. The Group carries 
out appropriate lobbying and communication, highlighting especially the 
importance of public transport to central and local government. Most 
importantly, we continue to focus on operational excellence and delivering 
value in our franchises.
3. Increasing competition
The Group’s divisions are facing increasing competition in various ways: 
price competition, inter-modal (eg coach vs rail), and more recently 
emerging threats such as new market entrants or disruptive technologies.
The Group is committed to operational and service excellence and the 
effective management of cost. Revenue trends are closely monitored and 
revenue management systems deployed. Our market strategy is to provide 
our customers with a compelling and differentiated offering. Effective 
processes are in place to ensure best practices are shared across the 
Group in many areas.
4. Terrorism
The Group can be either directly impacted by a terrorist event, or indirectly, 
through softening demand from the travelling public.
The Group liaises closely with government agencies and industry partners. 
Major incident/emergency plans are developed in all Divisions. Insurance 
coverage is available and in place for some terrorism-related risks.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 38 Principal risks and uncertainties Potential impact Management/mitigation
5. Safety, litigation and claims
A major safety-related incident (eg bus or rail accident) could impact  
the Group both financially and reputationally. The Group self-insures  
a proportion of certain risks such as workers’ compensation and auto 
liability, and higher than planned claims or cash settlements could 
adversely affect profit and cash outflow. The Group’s operations are also 
subject to potential litigation from other sources such as environmental 
legislation or wage and hour matters in the US. The Group is increasingly 
subjected to regulation in many areas and non-compliance with regulations 
can create legal and financial risk.
The Group has a strong safety culture driven from the Chief Executive  
and divisional leadership. The Group is dedicated to leading edge safety 
technology and has accelerated investment in the Lytx DriveCam 
technology. A new compliance steering committee has been establish  
in the Group’s North American business, chaired by the Divisional CEO. 
Appropriate insurance coverage is available and in place for accident-
related claims to employees and third parties, and the Group has 
experienced claims management and legal teams in each Division.  
All Divisions have established safety audit programs, supported by  
Group Internal Audit.
6. HR and labour relations
A lack of available talent/leadership skills can inhibit growth.  
Shortages in drivers and other key staff can disrupt operations. Increased  
unionisation and/or poor labour relations presents increased risk of strike  
or operational disruption; inflation of wage and benefit costs; and possible 
reputational damage.
The Group is committed to employee engagement and invests in a number 
of retention programmes. Appropriate training is provided for managers  
and supervisors. Reward and recognition programmes are established to 
further enhance employee engagement. The Group is focused on the 
effective management of stakeholder and union relationships, and the 
advice of specialist outside counsel is sought where necessary.
7. Changing customer expectations in a digital environment
Customers increasingly expect to be able to buy tickets and manage  
their travel plans through a variety of digital platforms. Failure to develop 
applications and digital channels that meet these increasing customer 
expectations could affect profitability, customer satisfaction and the 
business’ ability to capitalise on valuable customer data to enable 
commercial initiatives.
The Group has appointed a Chief Digital Officer; and comprehensive  
digital strategies are being developed in each Division. Divisional ‘digital 
scorecards’ are reviewed monthly by the Executive Committee to monitor 
the effectiveness of various digital channels.
8. IT, cyber risks and GDPR
A major IT failure could disrupt operations and lead to loss of revenues, 
especially in the Coach businesses. The Group recognises a wide range  
of cyber threats, including loss of data, social engineering, hacking  
and extortion.
The Group also recognises potential risks arising from the implementation 
of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
At a Divisional and Group level, comprehensive back-up procedures and 
disaster recovery plans are established. A dedicated Cyber Risk Security 
Committee was established in 2016, chaired by the Group Finance Director. 
External expert testing has been carried out for cyber risk and 
recommendations implemented.
The Group is in the process of implementing plans to ensure compliance 
with GDPR by 25 May 2018, when the new regulation becomes effective. 
These plans have been tailored at Divisional level to reflect the type of 
personal data of European subjects and the nature of processing such 
personal data which is carried on by each Division and to build on 
measures that are already in place in each Division which are designed 
 to comply with current national data protection laws.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 39 Principal risks and uncertainties Potential impact Management/mitigation
9. Credit risk
As contracted operations, the North American and Spanish urban 
businesses are exposed to the risk that customers are either late  
or unable to pay sums owed to the Group, impacting Group liquidity.
Receivables in each business are closely monitored, based on robust and 
thorough documentation; provisions are then made where appropriate on  
a prudent basis for a certain level of non-collection. Group Treasury actively 
manages the relationships with 18 banks who provide £544 million of 
committed bank facilities maturing in November 2021, giving the Group an 
appropriate level of liquidity when combined with a series of debt capital 
market issuances and a programme of finance leases.
10. Hazard risk to key site (eg fire); natural catastrophe; extreme weather
The loss of a key location to either a man-made hazard such as fire, or 
natural catastrophe such as a hurricane, can result in asset loss, a loss  
of revenue and profit, and a potential loss of competitive position in the 
market. Widespread events such as extreme weather events can also 
interrupt operations and cause revenue loss even if the Group’s assets  
are undamaged. 
The geographical diversification of the Group provides a natural hedge to 
this risk. Even at the Divisional level, the business operates from multiple 
locations. Each Division has established emergency and continuity plans. 
Insurance coverage is available and in place for some hazard related risks.
11. Foreign exchange
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency earnings through its overseas 
operations creates a risk that movement in exchange rates may adversely 
impact translation of profit and cash flows. 
The Group hedges all transactional risk and also actively manages the 
effective currency of its debt portfolio to manage gearing ratios and 
safeguard covenants. A range of tools are employed including local 
currency debt and currency swaps. In addition, management has  
flexibility to adjust Group capital allocation.
12. Fuel cost
Fuel represents a significant cost to the Group and unplanned increases  
in fuel price potentially impact profitability.
The Group operates a three year rolling hedge policy, hedging 100% of  
the next 15 months’ demand, with decreasing levels of cover in the latter 
periods topped up each month.
13. Pension costs
Market conditions and/or deficit may lead to increase in service costs  
and/or increased deficit recovery payments.
The Group’s Defined Benefit schemes are closed to new entrants. The UK 
Bus Dundee scheme was transferred to the local authority in 2017. Triennial 
valuations for the UK Group and West Midlands Travel schemes have been 
completed and contributions agreed to 2020.
Looking forward, the Group will focus  
on the following key areas of risk: 
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 40 Principal risks and uncertainties Statements of Company  
viability and going concern
Assessment of prospects
The Group’s strong financial position is characterised by operating 
cash conversion of 88% and free cash generation of £146m 
underpinned by 11% revenue growth. The Group’s credit rating is 
investment grade with committed facilities of £1.7bn and liquidity 
headroom of over £850m. This financial strength is built on the 
Group’s diversified portfolio and business model page 6. 
The Board reviewed the Group’s principal risks page 38 and 
determined that the six highlighted below should be assessed in 
considering the Group’s future viability. The Board selected the 
Group’s highest risks from the risk radar (terrorism, competition, 
Brexit terms, regulatory conditions and economic environment),  
and in addition, credit and financing risk, given its fundamental link  
to the meeting of liabilities and continuing operation of the Group. 
Based on these risks, the Board concluded that three years would be 
an appropriate timeframe over which to assess the Group’s ongoing 
viability, as within that timeline:
 – the majority of the major Spanish concession renewals are 
expected to complete;
 – the immediate impact of Brexit will be felt; and
 – €250m of the Group’s bonds will expire.
Assessment of viability 
The Group’s viability assessment is an output of the annual strategic 
planning process, taking as input the robust three-year financial plans 
produced by each business in the Group. To assess viability, multiple, 
material risks are assumed to crystallise in parallel during the 
assessment period, putting the financial and operational performance 
of the business under plausible, but unlikely stresses as outlined below.
Risk Stress tests
Competition Material fall in concessions income 
coupled with stalled growth in 
commercial revenue
Economic environment/ 
Brexit
Slow down of UK economic growth 
leading to margin contraction in  
UK businesses
Regulatory landscape Material margin loss in ALSA 
following ongoing long haul  
franchise renewal process
Terrorism UK transport sector faces extended 
revenue loss resulting in lower levels 
of discretionary travel
Economic environment Increased competition for drivers 
leads to an extended period of  
above inflation driver wage  
increases in the US
Credit/Financing risk Material increase in the cost  
of borrowing following period  
of reduced cash generation  
and profitability 
In the unlikely event of this concurrence of events, the Board would 
mitigate through reduced operating costs and capital expenditure  
to preserve the business’s cash flow. 
During assessment, the Group’s robust business model; continued 
cash generation; access to liquidity and funding; and mitigation 
actions demonstrated that it could tolerate the impact of the risk 
scenarios without breach of covenants or threat to business viability.
Viability Statement
Based on the results of the analysis, the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue in operation and be able  
to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period  
of assessment.
Going Concern 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are set out in the Group Finance Director’s 
Review on pages 19 to 23, and the Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report  
(pages 1-41). Note 30 to the Financial Statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its  
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its  
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure  
to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Board has reviewed assumptions about current trading 
performance, and has taken account of reasonably possible 
adverse changes to performance impacting availability of  
resources to June 2019. The Board confirms that it has a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources  
to continue in operation for the period reviewed, and accordingly  
the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis of  
accounting in preparing the financial statements for the year  
ending 31 December 2017.
Our 2017 Strategic Report, from page 1 to page 41, has  
been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors  
on 1 March 2018.

create and protect value for our investors 
and other stakeholders. It also significantly

governance, values and behaviours are in place and consistently 
applied in the boardroom and throughout the Group. The following

Dear fellow Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce the Corporate 
Governance Report for the year under review. 
The effective stewardship and governance of the Group remains  
a key commitment and high priority for the Board, which comes up  
in many aspects of its work. This is not only because high standards 
of corporate governance are vitally important in allowing the Directors  
to discharge their duties and responsibilities, but also because it  
helps management to enhance performance and protect value,  
and enables all our employees to embrace excellence and good 
governance in their day-to-day activities. 
Culture and values
As part of its responsibility to provide effective leadership to the 
organisation as a whole, the Board sets the culture and tone from  
the top. The Executive Directors, supported by the Non-Executives, 
lead by example to ensure our high standards and expected values, 
attitudes and behaviours are understood and consistently applied 
throughout the Group. Collective opportunities for communicating 
and demonstrating this to employees and management exist when 
the Board visits local operations, as it did during the year to Madrid 
and Washington DC (see page 53). The Board monitors the corporate 
culture by regularly receiving HR updates and reviewing the outcomes 
of employee opinion surveys which are normally conducted annually.
However, while culture might originate from the behaviour of leaders, 
it cannot be sustained by top-down mandates and examples alone. 
That is why our Values are embedded across the business and 
represent the way we live and breathe our culture. They underpin  
our business model, are fundamental to the way we work with our 
employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders, and guide 
the way we engage with the wider community and environment which 
is affected by our conduct. Our Vision and Values are explained on 
pages 30 to 35.
Sir John Armitt CBE  
Chairman
42 Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC Corporate Governance Report Board changes and effectiveness
The Board completed two Executive Director changes during the 
year. As previously reported, we welcomed Chris Davies to the Board 
on 10 May and he took up the position as Group Finance Director  
on 1 June 2017. He replaced Matt Ashley who, after two and a half 
successful years and as part of a career development opportunity 
within the Group, relinquished that role (but not his executive 
directorship) on 31 May. This was to take up the operational position 
as President and CEO of our North America business, based in 
Chicago, on 1 September. I would like to thank Matt for his 
contribution not only in his previous role but also in ensuring an 
effective induction and a smooth handover of responsibilities that 
enabled Chris to get up to speed by the end of the summer. I am 
delighted to say that both Chris and Matt have settled in well and 
made good starts in their new roles. As a result of these changes,  
the quality of the Board, together with our leadership and succession 
plans (which remain high on our agenda), have been strengthened. 
There were no Non-Executive Director changes to the Board or 
membership of its Committees during the year as these are working 
well and effectively. This was endorsed by the results of this year’s 
external Board and Committee evaluation, the findings from which 
and the key areas identified for further development are set out on 
pages 50 and 51. 
Board composition and diversity
The Nominations Committee undertook a formal review of the  
Board’s composition and concluded that its current balance  
(post the executive changes referred to above) remains appropriate  
to the Group’s forward-looking needs and our ability to continue 
delivering against our strategy. I believe there is a natural opportunity 
in relation to Non-Executive Director rotation over the next few years 
for us to consider our Board diversity, in its widest sense, including 
gender diversity (where 17% of our Directors are female), as one of 
the factors when making future appointments. In the business, we 
continue to embrace the benefits of workforce diversity and we are 
making progress in this important area. Nevertheless, the Board has 
challenged the executive to identify and pursue opportunities where 
we could be more active and drive change over time.
Governance
I am pleased to confirm that throughout the year we applied 
the principles and complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (‘Code’), a copy of which is available at  
www.frc.org.uk. The following pages of this report explain our 
governance framework and the robust processes and procedures 
we have in place to achieve this under each of the five main principles 
of the Code, namely: Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, 
Remuneration and Relations with Shareholders. Included as part  
of this is a report from the Chair of the Nominations, Audit, Safety & 
Environment and Remuneration Committees detailing the key matters 
addressed by each Committee during the year. 
A new Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which includes only a few 
changes from the current one, is being recommended to 
shareholders for approval at this year’s AGM (see below). We are 
confident that the new policy, intended to last until the AGM in 2021, 
is fit for purpose, aligns the interests of the Executives with those of 
shareholders and promotes the long-term success of the Company. 
The changes proposed, the positive outcome of the consultation 
undertaken with major shareholders and the new policy in full, can  
be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 99.
The Board is aware that a new Code is in preparation and we will look 
to pro-actively respond to developments arising from this as part of 
our 2018 agenda.
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)
This year, our AGM will be held at 2.00pm on Wednesday, 16 May 
2018 in the Horton Suite of the Burlington Hotel, 126 New Street, 
Birmingham, B2 4JQ. As this provides an opportunity for you to  
meet with and ask questions of your Directors regarding the business, 
this Annual Report and the matters before the meeting, I would 
encourage you to attend and look forward to meeting you.

Responsible for the development and implementation of strategy, leadership of the Group and,  
supported by the executive team, the overall performance of the business. 
Group Executive Committee 
Acts as an advisory and reporting body to the Group Chief Executive. Its main purpose is to oversee the safety,  
operational and financial performance of the Group, assess the ongoing impact of material risks, approve expenditure  
and other financial commitments within its authority level and discuss, formulate and approve proposals for  
onward consideration by the Board. It also addresses other key business and corporate related matters. 
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 44 Corporate Governance Report Board decision-making
Since the Board is the decision-making body for all significant matters 
affecting the Group, a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
approval is in place. These matters include: strategy, risk appetite  
and significant risk management; major acquisitions, disposals and 
bids; capital and liquidity matters; medium-term planning and the 
annual budget; financial results; key policies; Board and Committee 
membership and governance. Other matters, responsibilities and 
authorities have been delegated by the Board to its four standing 
Committees, namely: Nominations, Audit, Safety & Environment  
and Remuneration. 
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board and the terms of 
reference of each Committee, which are reviewed and approved 
annually, can be found on the Company’s website at  
www.nationalexpressgroup.com. Any matters outside of these fall 
within the responsibility and authority of the Group Chief Executive. 
He leads the Group Executive Committee, which operates in an 
advisory and reporting capacity to him, and both he and the  
Group Finance Director provide regular reports to the Board.
Setting the agenda
The Chairman and the Company Secretary are responsible, in 
consultation with the Group Chief Executive and the relevant Chair, 
for maintaining a rolling 12-month programme of agendas for the 
Board and its Committees. This is to ensure that all necessary 
matters are covered and prioritised time and attention allocated for 
discussion, recommendation and approval. At each meeting, the 
Board rigorously reviews updates on Group and divisional operating 
and financial performance versus plan and budget. Other regular 
Board agenda items include capital expenditure requests, tax and 
treasury updates, key project reviews, risk management, human 
capital, legal and governance and investor relations. The Committee 
Chairs also provide to the next Board meeting a summary of the main 
discussion points, decisions and recommendations arising from the 
last Committee meeting so that non-members are kept up to date 
with the work undertaken by each Committee. 
The key subjects and matters considered by the Board during the 
year are shown on page 47. Reports for each of the Committees, 
including details of their responsibilities and activities during the  
year, appear later in this section.
Board and Committee meetings and membership
The core activities of the Board and its Committees are carried out in scheduled meetings over one or two-day periods during the year. 
Additional meetings and other arrangements are made to consider and decide matters outside of scheduled meetings.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 49 Corporate Governance Report Effectiveness
Conclusions from this year’s review
The Directors concluded that, overall, the Board and its Committees 
operate to a high standard and work well. The dynamics, culture and 
effectiveness had improved noticeably since the last external review 
and the Directors believe they are functioning effectively as a team. 
The external evaluation had captured a number of strengths of the 
Board including the effectiveness of the Committee structure, 
particularly the Audit Committee, and the strong interaction and 
integrity by which it carried out its role. The Directors were observed 
to take their duties and responsibilities, and the discharge of them, 
extremely seriously and be committed to a culture of openness and 
transparency which is seen as a key strength. 
As with any Board, the Directors continue to look for areas of 
increased focus and further development and key areas identified 
from this year’s evaluation are set out below. Progress against them 
will be reviewed as part of the 2018 internal evaluation and reported 
on next year.
The Senior Independent Director, in consultation with the Non-
Executive Directors, led the annual performance evaluation of the 
Chairman during the year. It concluded (as did the external evaluation) 
that the Chairman was performing strongly and is highly effective in 
his role. Board meetings were well chaired and the relationship 
between the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive was 
considered to be very effective. The Chairman continued to devote 
sufficient time and attention to his role and maintained good informal 
relationships with all the Directors outside of meetings. 
2017 external evaluation
With internal evaluations having been carried out in each of the last 
two years, an external evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
was conducted in 2017 as the beginning of a new three-year cycle.  
It was conducted by Helen Pitcher of Advanced Boardroom 
Excellence (‘ABE’), a specialist consultancy which undertakes  
no other business for the Company, although she and ABE did 
undertake the Company’s last external evaluation in 2014. 
The Chairman and Company Secretary provided a comprehensive 
briefing to ABE ahead of the review programme commencement in 
November. The programme included attendance and observation  
at Board and Committee meetings as well as access to supporting 
materials to enhance the evaluation team’s understanding of how 
the Board and its Committees operate. In addition, detailed face- 
to-face interviews were held by Helen with each Director against  
a tailored agenda. 
A final report and recommendations were presented to the Board  
in February 2018 and considered by the Directors. Separate reports 
for each of the Nominations, Audit, Safety & Environment and 
Remuneration Committees were also prepared and their conclusions 
will be discussed with the respective Committee Chair in due course. 
The Chairman also received a report on each Director which he will 
be discussing with them individually together with any identified 
development or training needs. Lee Sander, as Senior Independent 
Director, received the report on the Chairman and he has reviewed 
that with him.
Performance evaluation
In line with the guidance provided under the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’), a performance evaluation of the effectiveness  
of the Board and its Committees, and of the Directors, is conducted annually within a three-year cycle set out below. The purpose  
is to identify opportunities to build on strengths, improve effectiveness and highlight areas for further development.

Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 50 Corporate Governance Report Key areas of focus and development in 2018
The key areas identified from this year’s external evaluation for 
increased focus and development in 2018 are set out below. A 
number of these anticipate the actions which will be required of the 
Board emerging from the new Code (expected in the summer) in the 
areas of executive succession and diversity.
 – Executive succession
Requiring increased engagement of the Board with the long-term 
executive succession and leadership planning of the business. 
 – Board and Committee succession
Requiring a focus on Board and Committee succession to ensure 
that the diversity and capability of the Board continues and is 
enhanced, with particular reference to gender balance.
 – External viewpoints
Requiring the Board to receive and be engaged with more external 
viewpoints as the uncertainty around Brexit and the rapid evolution 
of the transport sector technology continues.
Progress against actions from last year’s 
internal review
In addition to considering the results of this year’s external Board 
evaluation, the Directors reviewed progress against the actions 
identified from last year’s internal evaluation with the outcomes  
set out in the following table:
Action point Outcome
Bring more external viewpoints 
to the Board’s attention
Achieved, most notably in respect of the Board: (i) hearing directly from US Congressmen and women as part of the 
Board’s visit to Capitol Building in Washington DC last September (see page 53); and (ii) receiving a presentation from 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, joint house broker, in support of the Group’s Strategy 2018-2020 as part of the Board’s 
annual strategy review.
Enhance education and 
development opportunities  
for Directors
Deloitte Academy membership has been made available to all the Non-Executive Directors. This provides training, 
discussion and briefing forums on topical matters and includes access to an online information library. The introduction 
of quarterly human capital and talent development reports to the Board is proving extremely useful from a broader 
people management and talent identification perspective across the Group.
Extend length of Audit 
Committee meetings 
Audit Committee meetings have been extended by 30 minutes to allow for greater in-depth discussion on certain topics. 
This arrangement will continue going forward. 
Keep leadership and succession 
plans under review
The Nominations Committee continued to review both the Board’s and the Company’s leadership and succession plans 
during the year. Further details are set out on page 56.
Maintain focus on cyber security The Audit Committee continued to review the Group’s management of its cyber security agenda, risk register and progress 
against a prioritised remediation programme. Further details are set out on page 58. 
Information and support 
To enable the Directors to fulfil their duties and responsibilities 
effectively, they are provided with and given access to all necessary 
resources and expertise. This includes access to the Company 
Secretary (who acts as Secretary to the Board and its Committees)  
and management and, through an established procedure, the ability to 
obtain, at the Company’s expense, independent professional advice. 
Further details about the role and responsibilities of the Company 
Secretary can be found on page 46.
To facilitate effective review and decision-making, Directors receive  
in advance of meetings high-quality papers, including from senior 
executive, management and advisers, who are also regularly invited 
to attend meetings for discussion of specific items in greater depth. 
The papers are published via a secure web portal which also hosts  
a library of other relevant Company information, including previous 
meeting papers, minutes and Board procedures. 
If a Director is unable to attend a meeting because of exceptional 
circumstances, they still receive the papers and other relevant 
information in advance of the meeting and have the opportunity  
to discuss with the relevant Chair or the Company Secretary any 
matters on the agenda they wish to raise or to follow up on the 
decisions taken at the meeting. 
In addition to Board meetings and private sessions held between  
the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, there are other 
opportunities arranged during the year allowing for informal 
discussions between Directors on relevant items.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 51 Corporate Governance Report Effectiveness continued
Development and training
As part of an ongoing programme of development and training,  
which is the responsibility of the Chairman:
 – the Board held various specific briefing sessions during the year  
on matters such as Brexit, technology, digital marketing and other 
economic and political risk factors that may affect the business  
or the wider transport sector in our main operating territories 
 – Directors receive relevant information, as part of and between 
meetings, regarding the Group’s business, financial performance, 
shareholder sentiment and the legal, regulatory and governance 
environment in which it operates
 – all Directors are encouraged to attend training, discussion and 
briefing forums on relevant topical matters. For the Non-Executive 
Directors, this is available through the Deloitte Academy which 
facilitates such events, with online and remote follow up  
access available.
Additionally, to provide Directors with further opportunities to meet 
with senior and local management and increase their visibility and 
working knowledge of the Group’s operations and market dynamics, 
the Board aims to visit two of the Group’s locations each year. To that 
end, the Board meetings in June and September 2017 were held in 
Madrid and Washington DC respectively, the latter also facilitating the 
Board’s annual strategy review meeting. Details of the Washington trip 
can be found on the page opposite.
The Chairman also undertakes a busy programme of local site and 
management visits, which this year included a number of UK sites 
and a trip to our operations in Bahrain. To a lesser extent, but also 
encouraged, other Non-Executive Directors undertake similar 
personal visits from time to time. 
Executive Directors are permitted to accept one external non-
executive directorship with a non-competing company provided  
they first obtain Board approval. No such external appointments  
are currently held by any of the Executive Directors.
Conflicts of interest
The Board operates a policy to identify and manage declared actual 
and potential conflicts of interest which Directors (or their connected 
persons) may have and are obliged to avoid under their statutory 
duties and the Company’s Articles of Association. The Board 
considers each Director’s situation and decides whether to approve 
any conflicts based on the overriding principle that a Director must at 
all times only be able to consider and exercise judgement to promote 
the success of the Company. The policy has been in place and 
operated effectively throughout the year. Authorisations given  
by the Board are reviewed on a regular basis. 
There are no material conflicts currently in place save in respect  
of Jorge Cosmen’s position as a non-Independent Non-Executive 
Director and his association with the Cosmen family as a substantial 
shareholder (see page 103).
Induction 
All new Directors receive a structured and comprehensive induction 
programme. It is prepared and arranged by the Chairman and 
Company Secretary, with executive input as necessary, tailored  
to the experience and background of the individual and the 
requirements of the role. 
Such an induction programme was formulated for Chris Davies who 
took up his first executive appointment in joining the Board on 10 May 
and becoming Group Finance Director on 1 June 2017. He replaced 
Matt Ashley who relinquished that position (but not his executive 
directorship) to take up a new role with the Group as President and 
CEO, North America, on 1 September. Mr Ashley and the Company 
Secretary led the induction programme which also provided for a 
smooth handover of responsibilities and included:
 – the issue of a Board induction pack to assist with understanding 
the Group’s history, culture, business, markets, strategy,  
risk management framework (including the risk environment), 
internal controls and financial position
 – hands on briefing meetings coupled with introductory meetings 
with direct reports, members of the Group Executive Committee, 
the Chairman and the Audit Committee Chair (and subsequently 
with all Directors)
 – meetings with the Company’s external auditors, brokers and lead 
bankers (and subsequently with other key advisers and 
stakeholders)
 – specific information and training sessions with the Company 
Secretary, the Company’s corporate lawyers and the Director of 
Safety regarding Directors’ duties, responsibilities and liabilities, 
Board mechanics, corporate governance practices and key policies 
and procedures (including the Group’s Health & Safety policy, plan 
and standards)
 – a number of site visits in the UK, Spain and the US, including with 
the Board in June to Madrid and in September to Washington DC. 
Mr Ashley also benefited from a structured business and customer 
focused induction programme provided to him in Chicago by his 
predecessor, local management and the US General Counsel.
Both of the above induction programmes, and their progress  
to completion, were overseen by the Chairman and reported 
on to the Board through the Company Secretary. 
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 52 Corporate Governance Report Our visit to the recently acquired business  
in Baltimore enabled us to see how we take 
best practice from our existing operations 
and apply them to new operations, especially 
with regards to safety. The visit allowed us to 
see how our Board discussions and priorities 
are translated into action on the ground, 
where it really matters. 
 
Dr Ashley Steel, Non-Executive Director
Board in action
A conventional view of non-executive directors is that they govern 
from afar. In today’s business world, particularly given the increasing 
risk, governance and public scrutiny environment, that simply doesn’t 
work, and it doesn’t exist at National Express. We believe that 
connection with and understanding of the business are key 
fundamentals for our Non-Executive Directors if they are to maximise 
their contribution to an effective Board. That’s why, as part of an 
ongoing development programme, we aim to take the Board out of 
the boardroom and visit the business twice a year. This increases the 
visibility of the Board and provides the Non-Executives with valuable 
opportunities to engage with local management and employees, and 
increase their working knowledge of the Group’s operations and 
market dynamics. 
With this in mind, the Board went to Madrid in June to meet with 
ALSA’s management and various business teams. In September,  
the Board went to Washington DC and visited four of our bus and 
transit Customer Service Centres (‘CSCs’) in the area, and the local 
Safety and Training Centre. The Directors toured the facilities and 
received presentations from management and employees about the 
business and their role in the operation. They spent time with drivers 
and maintenance technicians gaining valuable feedback on the 
Group’s culture and values and how those are interpreted and  
exist locally. 
The Directors also had a unique and insightful opportunity while in  
Washington to meet with Congressmen Holding and Rokita and 
Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers during an evening visit to Capitol 
Building. They heard relevant political views on Brexit and its potential 
impact on the future trading relationship between the US and the UK, 
and the importance placed on safe customer services in the areas of 
transport in which we operate. 
It’s always a pleasure and source of 
inspiration to meet our front-line colleagues 
and drivers – teams absolutely committed  
to the children and communities they serve. 
The stand out for me from the Washington 
trip was to see our investment in DriveCam 
CCTV being rolled out and in action. Already 
we can see the power of this investment, its 
contribution to driver learning and coaching 
and of course the early signs of a significant 
improvement in some of our safety metrics.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 53 Corporate Governance Report Dear fellow Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Nominations Committee Report which 
summarises our work over the past year.
Once again, Board succession planning and its implementation has 
been a main area of focus for the Committee, together with talent 
development at senior management level. The process of building 
and strengthening an effective Board requires the right blend of 
expertise, continuity and refreshment and the Committee has borne 
this in mind in its deliberations throughout the year. 
Board composition
The successful delivery of our strategy depends upon attracting and 
retaining the right talent. This starts with having a high-quality Board 
in place and balance is an important requirement for its composition, 
not only in terms of the number of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors, but also in terms of expertise, diversity and backgrounds. 
The composition of the Board was reviewed during the year with the 
Committee concluding that the balance (post the changes referred  
to below) remained appropriate to the Group’s forward-looking needs 
and its ability to continue delivering against our strategy.
At the date of this report, the Board consists of 12 members 
comprising myself as Non-Executive Chairman (independent on 
appointment), three Executive Directors, seven Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and one non-Independent Non-Executive 
Director. The chart opposite demonstrates the strong and in-depth 
mix of skills and experience possessed by the current Board.
Board changes
In January, and as previously reported, the Committee completed its 
search, selection and recommendation process which ultimately led 
to Chris Davies joining the Board as an Executive Director on 10 May 
and being appointed Group Finance Director on 1 June 2017. He was 
recruited to replace Matt Ashley who, after two and a half successful 
years and as part of a career development opportunity within the 
Group, relinquished that role (but not his executive directorship) on  
31 May. This was to take up the operational position as President  
and CEO of our North America business, based in Chicago, on  
1 September. Both of these appointments were well planned and well 
executed and details of their tailored induction programmes, overseen 
by myself and the Company Secretary, can be found on page 52.  
As a result of these two changes, I believe that the quality of the 
Board, its leadership and our succession plans (which remain high  
on the agenda) have been strengthened. 
During the year, there were no Non-Executive Director changes to  
the Board or membership of any of its Committees as these are all 
working well and effectively (as endorsed by the results of this year’s 
external Board and Committee evaluation – see pages 50 and 51) and 
remain compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’).
Primary role
To ensure that the Board and its Committees are properly  
structured and balanced (including the requisite skills, knowledge  
and experience) and that rigorous succession planning is in place  
for Directors and senior management (including the identification  
of candidates from both within and outside the Group).
The Committee’s terms of reference, reviewed and approved  
annually, are available on the Company’s website at  
www.nationalexpressgroup.com.
Key responsibilities
 – Monitor the structure, size and composition of the Board and its 
Committees and make recommendations to the Board accordingly 
 – Succession planning for Directors and senior management 
 – Identify and nominate, for approval by the Board, suitable 
candidates to fill Board vacancies 
 – Lead the process for new Board appointments 
 – Review the time commitment required by the Non-Executive 
Directors to fulfil their duties
Activity highlights 
 – Completion of recruitment of new Group Finance Director and 
appointment of new President and CEO, North America
 – Assessment of composition of the Board and its Committees
 – Review of succession planning and executive talent management
 – Rigorous review of three Non-Executives to remain in office

Nominations Committee 
Report
Sir John Armitt CBE  
Committee Chair
54 Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC Corporate Governance Report Diversity at Board level 
While all appointments are made on merit, the Board strongly  
believes that an increasing diversity at Board level is acknowledged 
as essential in maintaining a competitive advantage. A truly diverse 
Board (and senior management team) will include and make good  
use of differences in the skills, experience, knowledge, thinking styles, 
background, race, gender, independence and other qualities of 
individuals. These differences are considered by the Committee  
in determining the optimum composition of the Board and will 
continue to be balanced appropriately to maintain and enhance  
its effectiveness. 
The appointment of Mr Davies to the Board has meant that our 
female Director representation has reduced to 17% from 18% last 
year. The Committee believes a natural opportunity exists in relation 
to Non-Executive Director rotation over the next three years to 
influence the gender and ethnic diversity mix of the Board which 
would form part of our commitment to increase female representation 
on the Board to 33% by 2020, as per the recommendation of the 
Hampton-Alexander Review. 
Diversity in the business 
National Express is committed to a culture that attracts and retains 
talented people to deliver outstanding performance and enhances the 
success of the Group. In that regard, diversity across a broad range 
of criteria is recognised as an important business asset that fosters 
innovation and helps us better understand and meet the needs of  
our customers and the communities we serve. 
The Group has a Diversity Policy which applies to all employees and 
supports and promotes our commitment; the ethos is also reflected 
in our embedded Values. Local management is responsible for 
implementation and communication of the policy and training forms 
part of a new employee’s induction process. 
Recognising the racial and cultural diversities of the business and 
territories in which we operate, diversity is far more than gender 
based. During the year, we have we continued to embrace the 
benefits of workforce diversity and we are making progress in this 
regard. For example, in the UK, where our employees span more than 
50 different nationalities, new mechanisms and initiatives introduced 
to support and encourage women in business have led to an 
increased number of women in supervisory and management roles, 
as well as in revenue protection, driving instruction and engineering 
apprenticeships. That said, the Board has challenged the executive to 
promote and communicate an inclusive, positive and proactive story 
across the whole Group and to identify and pursue opportunities 
where we could be more active and drive change over time. The 
monitoring and development of our diversity programme  
will remain a key focus in 2018.

Succession planning
It is important for the Board to anticipate and prepare for the future 
and to ensure that the skills, knowledge and experience of the 
Directors and senior management reflect the changing demands of 
the business and are aligned to delivering on the Company’s strategy. 
The Board recognises that an active Nominations Committee is key  
to promoting effective succession planning and ensuring that a strong 
pipeline of future senior management has been identified from which 
future Board appointments can be considered. Equally important  
is the need to support the development and skill set enhancement of 
the current Executive Directors. 
Led by the Committee, succession plans are formally reviewed at 
least annually by the Board as a whole, with quarterly talent and 
development updates from across the business presented by the 
Group HR Director. The Group has a well-established and robust 
succession planning process which covers all Group Executive 
Committee members and their direct reports, divisional management 
and other employees who have longer-term high potential for senior 
roles. The Committee’s opinion is that the plans are aligned to the 
Company’s strategy, are well prepared and appropriate for the size  
of the Group and its management structure, and there is a range of 
good candidates in the pipeline for senior roles. Any potential gaps 
are the subject of both internal development plans and/or timely 
selected external recruitment.
Independence, effectiveness and 
commitment
The independence, effectiveness and commitment of each of the 
Non-Executive Directors is annually reviewed by myself and I share 
my views with the Nominations Committee and the Board. During the 
year, the Committee satisfied itself as to the individual contributions 
and time commitment of all the Non-Executive Directors bearing in 
mind their other offices and interests held. The Board considers 
myself and each of the Non-Executive Directors, other than Jorge 
Cosmen, to be independent and free of any relationships which could 
materially interfere with the exercise of our independent judgement. 
Mr Cosmen is not considered to be independent due to his close  
links with the ALSA business in Spain and the significant share 
interests that the Cosmen family hold in the Company. Despite his 
non-independent status, I feel that the Board benefits greatly from 
having Mr Cosmen’s extensive local market knowledge and 
experience to hand in the boardroom. 
In respect of Lee Sander, Chris Muntwyler and Joaquín Ayuso, who 
each attained six years’ service since last year’s AGM, I conducted  
a rigorous review of their suitability to remain in office for up to a 
nine-year term (including taking account of the need for progressive 
refreshing of the Board). This was undertaken because the Code 
suggests that length of tenure is a factor to consider, particularly 
where service is six years or more, when determining the 
independence of Non-Executive Directors. The Committee was 
confident that all three Directors remain independent, committed  
to their role and, as with the other Non-Executive Directors, would 
continue to be highly effective members of the Board and able  
to fully discharge their duties and responsibilities going forward.
Director’s re-election
Based on the above Director assessment, the Board is 
recommending the formal election to office of Mr Davies and  
the re-election to office of all the other Directors at this year’s AGM. 
Details of the Service Agreement for the Executive Directors and 
Letters of Appointment for the Non-Executive Directors, and their 
availability for inspection, are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 68 to 99. 
Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s operations and activities formed part of the external 
review of Board effectiveness performed in the year and which 
confirmed the Committee continues to operate well and effectively. 
Details of this review and the identified areas for further development 
are provided on pages 50 and 51. 
Looking forward
In 2018, the Committee will continue to look at Board and senior 
management succession planning with a focus on diversity 
development. In response to such ongoing internal and external 
succession planning work, and given the expected increase in the 
number and scope of changes likely to arise from a busy governance 
pipeline, the Committee will also consider increasing the number  
of scheduled meetings it holds each year. 
Sir John Armitt CBE

It is critical to our continued success  
that we have the right people with the  
right range of skills and experience on the 
Board and in senior management positions. 
At present we do, and our succession plans 
are geared towards ensuring that we do in 
the years to come.

Dear fellow Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee’s Report for the year 
under review. It demonstrates not only the Committee’s activities 
against a structured programme but also the detailed level of review 
and reporting now taking place on the back of a growing regulatory 
and legislative agenda.
In terms of compliance with the 2016 UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘Code’) and the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees, I believe 
the Committee has continued to address the spirit and requirements 
of both during the year. 
Review of the year
The Committee again challenged itself to ensure its work continued  
to address those areas of most importance to the Group and/or 
which could have a material impact on its current or future financial 
performance. This resulted in prioritisation of its time and attention 
being given to the following key matters: 
 – the accounting requirements associated with the sale of the  
Essex Thameside c2c franchise to Trenitalia, and the consequential 
restructuring of UK coach and bus
 – resolution of the revenue recognition issues associated with 
German Rail
 – the judgements applied by management in relation to insurance/
other claims and goodwill/fixed asset impairment
 – assessment of the potential impact of the new accounting 
standards IFRS 9 and 15 (which come into force this year), and 16 
(which comes into force in 2019)  
 – the reporting impact arising from the new ESMA Guidelines on 
Alternative Performance Measures
 – the impact of refinancing activities on the Group’s financial position
 – the Group’s tax strategy and implementation of new tax evasion 
defence procedures
 – the impact on the Group’s future effective tax rate following 
changes in US tax rates introduced in December 2017.
While there were no changes in the Committee’s membership in 2017, 
the Company did welcome Chris Davies as its new Group Finance 
Director on 1 June. He succeeded Matt Ashley who relinquished that 
role (but not his executive directorship) to take up the position of 
President and CEO of our North America business on 1 September 
2017. I would like to thank Matt for effecting a smooth handover  
and induction for Chris, enabling him to get up to speed so quickly. 
The Committee has seen Chris make a good start in his new role. 
Risk landscape
The Committee reviewed changes in risk affecting the Group at  
both a macro-economic and geopolitical level, as well as other risks 
affecting the business at an operational level, including cyber security 
and rapid technological change. While no new risks were added to 
the Group’s significant risk register during the year, some minor 
changes to our risk radar were made arising from developments in 
the risk environment, most notably in respect of terrorism given the 
events in London, Manchester and Barcelona last year. Overall, the 
Group’s risk profile has improved strategically through its UK rail 
divestment earlier in the year, and this has been recognised by both  
the investor and analyst community. 
Accountability 
Audit Committee Report
Mike McKeon 
Committee Chair
Financial Statements Additional Information Strategic Report Corporate Governance
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 57 Corporate Governance Report Accountability continued 
Audit Committee Report continued
Sound risk management and internal 
control systems are essential to enable 
the Group to achieve its objectives, while 
proper accountability to shareholders 
requires fair and balanced performance 
reporting. The Committee’s role is to 
ensure both are in place.
In relation to cyber security, management continues to maintain a 
specific risk register and follow a prioritised remediation programme 
monitored by the Cyber Security Committee. Additionally, external 
projects are in progress targeted at ISO 27001 accreditation, and 
employee awareness and training continues to be rolled out across 
the Group. I am pleased to report that our external security advisers, 
ZeroDayLabs, and our co-sourced experts, PwC, have validated the 
good progress we are making with our cyber security programme. 
We are however not complacent, knowing that risks in this area 
continue to evolve rapidly.
A coordinated programme is in place, jointly led by the Group Finance 
Director and the Group Commercial Director, in respect of our 
preparations for compliance with the new General Data Protection 
Regulation (‘GDPR’) across the businesses by May this year. 
Overall, the risk landscape continues to be challenging but the Group 
is well placed to understand and manage it. 
Internal audit and control
Notwithstanding that the Group’s internal audit continues to  
operate effectively, as recently assessed by the Committee, we have 
commissioned an external quality assurance review of the function. 
The purpose is to benchmark its structure and activities against best 
practice and identify a roadmap to where it should be positioned 
going forward, aligned with the future needs of the business. EY will 
undertake the review in early 2018 and I will report on its outcome 
next year. 
Following the discovery of a non-material fraud at one of our Spanish 
locations, the Committee reviewed the results of a controls audit of all 
cash handling operations across the Group. I am pleased to say that 
we were satisfied this was a one-off occurrence and that the controls 
in place elsewhere across the Group would have prevented a similar 
event occurring. Controls at the Spanish location have been improved 
with the help of input from third-party experts. 
Viability Statement 
The Committee reviewed and challenged management on the 
Group’s viability outlook period as well as on the viability analysis  
and conclusions, and satisfied itself that three years remained 
appropriate. The Viability Statement, and the rationale  
for the period selected, is set out on page 41. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee assessed and recommended to the Board  
(which it subsequently endorsed) that, taken as a whole, the 2017 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and provides  
the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.
FRC Corporate Reporting Review
At the end of last year and early this year, I reviewed and approved 
responses to the FRC Corporate Reporting Review team’s information 
request relating to the Company’s 2016 Annual Report. The FRC has 
since advised the Company that their enquiry is closed.
Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s operations and activities formed part of the external 
review of Board effectiveness performed in the year. Details of this 
review are provided on pages 50 and 51. Overall, the Committee 
continued to operate effectively and to a very high standard during 
the year, with clear priorities, well-defined responsibilities and clarity 
around its work plan.
Looking forward
I expect 2018 will be another busy year for the Committee in fulfilling 
its core responsibilities and in completing the assessment of the 
impact of IFRS 16, Leases, on the Group’s accounts (for which we 
expect an update will form part of this year’s interim results), 
responding to changes arising from the new Code (expected 
mid-year) and finalising our preparations for GDPR compliance.
Finally, I would like to thank the other members of the Committee, 
together with management and Deloitte, for their support during  
the year.
Mike McKeon 
Audit Committee Chair

Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 58 Corporate Governance Report Committee composition and operations
The Board is satisfied that the Committee as a whole possesses relevant sectoral experience and that its members bring a broad range of 
financial and commercial experience from across various industries. It is also satisfied that Mike McKeon in particular possesses the recent  
and relevant experience required by the Code. 
Details of the Committee meetings held during the year are shown on page 57. The Committee also hosts private sessions with the external 
auditor and/or Head of Group Internal Audit after each meeting. The Committee Chair has regular private sessions with the Group Finance

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 59 Corporate Governance Report Significant financial matters 
The following descriptions are of the two significant financial matters considered by the Committee, with input from management and the 
external auditor, in connection with the Group’s financial statements and disclosures. These were considered to be significant taking into 
account the level of materiality and the degree of judgement exercised by management. The descriptions should be read in conjunction  
with the Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 106 to 113 and the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
We have not provided a description this year (and the external auditor has not reported on them) of the risks associated with taxation, pensions 
and fuel hedge accounting as these were downgraded from significant to normal risk by Deloitte as part of their audit plan for the year. In 
consultation with management and Deloitte, the Committee has of course continued to monitor and review these matters though not as 
significant issues. 
Goodwill and fixed asset impairment (see note 2 and 14 to the financial statements)
The Committee considered whether the carrying 
value of goodwill and fixed assets held on the 
Group’s balance sheet should be impaired. The 
potential risk is around the recoverability of these 
balances, particularly in relation to our ALSA and 
North America businesses, as assessed annually 
by management as part of their goodwill 
impairment review using discounted cash flows  
on a value in use basis. The key judgements relate 
to the discount rate and the future growth rate 
applied as the value in use models are highly 
sensitive to changes in these rates, both of which 
must reflect a long-term view of the underlying 
growth in each respective economy. 
The Committee received a detailed report from management which outlined the robust 
impairment analysis undertaken for the year on a bottom-up basis and which included: 
the underlying cash flows, discount rates and future growth rates assumed, the 
improved modelling adopted relating to the use of a country-specific discount rate  
and various impact scenarios arising from the outcome of ALSA’s concession renewal 
programme. The report concluded that there is not a material risk of recoverability in  
this area and that neither the North America nor the ALSA goodwill assets are impaired. 
Indeed, both have healthy levels of headroom (in the case of North America, further 
enhanced by the recent changes in US tax rates) that compares well with previous  
years notwithstanding the additions of goodwill during the year through ongoing 
acquisition activities. 
The Committee challenged management’s methodology and assumptions and 
consulted with Deloitte, whose own testing and validation of the critical assumptions 
had resulted in them concurring with management’s conclusion. As a result, the 
Committee was satisfied that the goodwill and intangible assets of the Group as  
at the balance sheet date are not impaired.
Insurance and other claims provisions (see note 2 to the financial statements)
The Committee considered the adequacy of the 
provisions associated with insurance and other 
claims arising predominantly from traffic accidents 
and employee incidents, particularly in North 
America. The estimation of such provisions, 
including those arising on acquisition, is 
judgemental and based on an assessment of the 
expected settlement of known claims together  
with an estimate of settlements that will be made in 
respect of incidents incurred but not yet reported 
at the balance sheet date. Given the level of 
complexity and judgement involved in making 
these estimations there is a risk that the eventual 
outcome could be materially different from that 
estimated and provided for. 
The Committee received and discussed with management a report from the Group 
Director of Insurance and Risk on North America insurance and other claims, 
particularly the key judgements made in determining the level of provisions, the 
methodology used, the measurement of self-insured claims and the extent to which 
they were supported by third party actuarial advice. It also reviewed the rigorous 
audit investigation undertaken by Deloitte which included actuarial specialists’ 
challenge of the underlying assumptions around loss development, sample testing 
and in-depth discussion with the US General Counsel and members of the local 
claims handling team. 
The Committee noted that in considering the overall balance sheet provision, there 
was a wide range of potential outcomes. However, taking into account the thorough 
internal analysis undertaken and the audit work conducted by Deloitte, the Committee 
concluded that the provision for North America insurance and other claims, as 
recommended by management, was within an acceptable range and was fairly stated.
In addition to the above, the Committee has considered, taken action and made onward recommendations to the Board, as appropriate, on a  
range of other matters, including in relation to the Viability Statement, the going concern basis on which the financial statements are prepared,  
the accounting treatment of business combinations, acquisitions and disposals (in particular regarding the sale of property and the sale of 
Essex Thameside c2c franchise to Trenitalia), the potential impact arising from the new accounting standards IFRS 9 and 15, and other specific 
areas of audit, compliance and governance focus.
The Committee was satisfied that all issues had been fully and adequately addressed, that the judgements made by management were 
reasonable and appropriate and had been reviewed and debated with the external auditor (who concurred with the approach taken by 
management), and that the accounting and disclosure requirements were correct.
Accountability continued 
Audit Committee Report continued
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 60 Corporate Governance Report External auditor 
Deloitte, as the external auditor, is engaged to conduct a statutory 
audit and express an opinion on the financial statements. Their audit 
includes the review and testing of the systems of internal financial 
control and data which are used to produce the information contained 
in the financial statements.
The current external audit engagement partner (appointed with effect 
from 1 January 2016) is Stephen Griggs, Head of Audit and Risk 
Advisory for Deloitte in the UK. 
The external audit plan and the £1.1m fee proposal for the financial 
year under review (2016: £1.1m) was prepared by Deloitte in 
consultation with management and presented to the Committee for 
consideration and approval. The plan again focused on risk, challenge 
and materiality and was aligned to the Group’s structure and strategy. 
However, it was also designed to transition the audit, as directed by 
Deloitte, to be more internal control assurance (and less substantive) 
in its emphasis. 
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
objectivity and independence of Deloitte as external auditor.  
In undertaking this annual assessment for the year under review,  
and concluding that their independence remained assured, the 
Committee considered: a report on their independence submitted  
by Deloitte (which included the internal safeguards operated by  
them); the mitigating actions taken by the Company to safeguard their 
independent status (see ‘Non-audit services’ below); the tenure of the 
current audit engagement partner (being less than five years); and the 
positive outcome of the external audit and performance review of 
Deloitte (see below). 
Effectiveness 
Immediately following completion of the external audit process for 
2017, the Committee conducted a review of its effectiveness and a 
performance review of Deloitte. This was carried out through a mix  
of a survey questionnaire and analysis and follow-up consultation  
with Committee members, the Executive Directors, members of the 
senior finance team and divisional Finance Directors. The qualitative 
assessment focused on the valuable feedback and insights received, 
process and communication, handling of issues and the quality of the 
audit team, and had regard to the latest Audit Quality Inspection 
Report on Deloitte issued by the FRC. 
The Committee’s conclusion was that Deloitte had again completed 
an effective audit process which provided an appropriate level of 
independent challenge to the Group’s senior management. 
Additionally, Deloitte continue to perform their services, in respect  
of both the audit and their work generally, to a high standard. Areas 
identified for development have been shared with them for inclusion  
in their service delivery plans going forward. 
External audit tendering policy
The Company last put its external audit out to competitive tender in 
2011 following which Deloitte was appointed to the office of auditor. 
Having undertaken such a process, the Company has complied with 
the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014. 
The Company is next required to retender the audit by no later than 
the financial year ending 2021. The Committee will assess the quality 
of the external audit annually and, on the basis that its quality remains 
high and the audit fee represents good value to shareholders (both as 
benchmarked versus market practice), it is expected that the next 
audit tender will take place at that time. 
On the recommendation of the Committee, the Board is proposing  
a resolution to reappoint Deloitte to office as external auditor for a 
further year at this year’s AGM.
Non-audit services
To help protect the objectivity and independence of Deloitte, and  
in addition to their own internal safeguards, the Company operates  
a Non-Audit Services Policy that sets out the types of non-audit 
services, such as assurance work, which Deloitte may provide to  
the Group. The policy remained unchanged during the year although 
a new policy (which includes an enhanced pre-approval process, 
specific financial control limits and a more definitive list of permitted 
and non-permitted services), has been approved by the Committee 
effective from 1 January 2018. The new policy also meets the FRC’s 
revised Ethical Standards requirements. 
Details of the fees charged by Deloitte, split between audit and 
permitted non-audit fees, for the year ended 31 December 2017 can 
be found in note 6 to the financial statements on page 131. Total fees 
for non-audit services, including the half year review, amounted to 
£0.12m, representing 11% of the Group’s total audit fees payable to 
Deloitte for the year. No audit fees were approved or paid on a 
contingent basis.

Audit Committee Report continued
Internal audit 
The Committee has oversight and directional responsibility for the 
Group’s internal audit function which is led by the Group Head of 
Internal Audit and who has a direct reporting line into the Committee 
Chair. The function’s purpose is to provide an independent and 
objective assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls,  
risk management and governance processes in operation throughout 
the Group. The function adds value by:
 – contributing to the continuous improvement of internal control and 
related processes, including identifying and sharing good practice 
across the Group
 – addressing the safeguarding of assets, compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations and achievement of management’s 
operational objectives
 – promoting business processes that deliver effective internal control 
at reasonable cost
 – providing alignment with the Group’s risk management process.
An Internal Audit Charter sets out the responsibilities of both the 
internal audit function (in terms of its focus, programme of activity, 
scope of investigations and reporting lines) and management  
(in terms of it providing support and co-operation at all levels  
of the organisation).
The annual internal audit plan and resource allocation (including any 
external specialist assistance required) is reviewed and approved  
by the Committee to ensure it is aligned with the key risks of the 
business and the Group’s strategic plan. The Committee receives 
update reports at each meeting confirming the key findings from 
reviews undertaken, the material actions required to implement the 
recommendations and the status of progress against previously 
agreed actions. These include the identification of known instances  
of fraud, theft or similar irregularities affecting the Group, although 
there were no such matters that were sufficiently material to warrant 
separate disclosure in this report.
Effectiveness 
The Committee monitors and formally assesses the effectiveness  
of the internal audit function on an annual basis and seeks to satisfy 
itself that the quality, expertise, experience and cost of the function is 
appropriate to the Group. This was conducted for 2017 through a mix 
of a survey questionnaire and analysis and feedback from both senior 
management and local management. Overall, the Committee 
concluded that the function continued to be effective, objective and 
independent in the work it undertakes, and has a good reputation 
with operational management in the performance of its role. 
Notwithstanding the above, and aligned to the recommendations  
of the International Internal Auditing Standards, the Committee has 
commissioned EY to conduct an external quality assurance review of 
the internal audit function in early 2018. This will provide useful insight 
and benchmarking versus best practice as well as development 
recommendations to ensure the function continues to add value  
and is positioned to satisfy the future needs of the business.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for determining both the nature and extent 
of the Group’s risk management and internal control framework and 
for setting the tone on the risk appetite that is acceptable in seeking 
to achieve its strategic objectives. The Committee is responsible for 
reviewing and monitoring the adequacy, design and effectiveness of 
the Group’s ongoing systems of risk management and internal control 
(which includes financial, operational and compliance controls), and 
reporting to the Board accordingly, with primary responsibility for their 
operation delegated to management. These systems have been 
designed to safeguard both the shareholders’ investment and the 
assets of the Group and manage, rather than eliminate, the risks 
inherent in achieving the Group’s business objectives. They can 
therefore provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Risk management 
The organisation has an embedded risk management culture and  
the Group Director of Insurance and Risk oversees the numerous 
sub-committees and work groups that own and manage day-to-day 
risk in the business at local and divisional level. 
The Committee receives regular updates on the Group’s risk register 
and risk radar which allows for discussion of the significant and 
emerging risks affecting the business and monitoring of progress 
against previously agreed actions. It also receives regular reports 
from the external auditor, and from internal audit and other major 
business functions on various aspects of internal control, financial 
reporting and risk management. In turn, the Committee provides  
the Board with interim assessments of risk impact on the Group’s 
financial position, accounting affairs and control systems and on how 
material risks to the Group are being managed. The annual risk 
management work plan, prepared in consultation with management, 
is reviewed and approved by the Committee to ensure alignment with 
the changing risk profile and priorities of the business. 
A summary of the Group’s risk management framework, and the 
process in place for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal 
risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, is set out on pages  
38 to 40.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 62 Corporate Governance Report Internal control
The following items represent the key elements of the Group’s internal 
control system (which is subject to internal audit’s ongoing programme 
of review and reporting to the Committee):
 – a devolved organisational structure with clear leadership, 
responsibility and delegated authorities 
 – a divisional performance and key function review process 
conducted on a monthly basis 
 – a comprehensive annual strategy and operating plan review 
 – a robust annual and monthly budgeting, forecasting and financial 
reporting process
 – a delegated authorities matrix defining approval limits for various 
classifications of expenditure and investment 
 – a top-down/bottom-up approach to risk management and  
internal control 
 – various policies, procedures and guidelines underpinning the 
development, management, financing and main operations  
of the business
 – specialist professional support services provided on a central and/
or divisional basis, as appropriate, covering safety, property and 
environment, legal, human resources, communications, insurance, 
information services, tax and treasury, and company secretarial.
Effectiveness 
Assisted by the Committee, the Board reviewed the systems of 
internal control and risk management described above (which have 
been in place for the year under review and through to the signing 
date of this Annual Report) taking into account the assurance work 
undertaken by both the risk management and internal audit functions, 
and the relevant process, controls and testing undertaken by Deloitte 
as part of their half year review and full year audit. No significant 
weaknesses or control failures were found while identified opportunities 
to strengthen the controls have been taken and will themselves be 
subject to regular review as part of the internal assurance process.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee reviewed the Annual Report in terms of its 
preparation, control process, verification of content, consistency  
of information (including the appropriate weighting given to ‘bad 
news’ as well as ‘good news’) and linkage between key messages 
throughout the document. It also received a specific paper from 
management to assist in its challenge and testing of a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment. 
Based on the above, and the views expressed by Deloitte, the 
Committee recommended, and in turn the Board confirmed,  
that the 2017 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced  
and understandable and provides the necessary information for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Bribery and Corruption Policy
The Board has a zero-tolerance policy in place against bribery  
and corruption of any sort. Regular training is given to employees, 
including new employees, to highlight areas of vulnerability and 
reporting procedures. Our principal suppliers are also required  
to have similar policies and practices in place within their  
own businesses. 
Whistleblowing Policy
The Committee reviews the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements, 
incorporated within a specific policy and applied in each of the 
businesses, which allows employees to report genuine concerns 
about suspected impropriety or wrongdoing (whether financial or 
otherwise) on a confidential basis, and anonymously if preferred.  
This takes the form of a free independent telephone hotline in each 
country of operation. Any matters reported are investigated by local 
legal counsel in the first instance with monthly summary reports 
submitted to the Group Company Secretary (and reviewed by the 
Group Executive Committee) in case a higher level of independent 
investigation is required. During the year, there were no 
whistleblowing incidents investigated at Group level.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present this year’s Safety & Environment Report 
which provides an overview of the Group’s main activities and 
progress in these areas during the year. More information can be 
found on these matters on pages 31 and 34 respectively.
The safety of our employees and customers is of critical importance 
to the Board, as is the responsible management of our environmental 
obligations. I would like to thank our Group Chief Executive, Dean 
Finch, and his management team for their ongoing leadership and 
effectiveness in again driving improvements in both these areas  
in 2017. 
As part of my role as Committee Chair, I visit operations to better 
understand the safety risks, exposures and challenges faced by  
the business and the actions being taken locally to address them. 
I have recently returned from such a visit to six school bus and transit 
Customer Service Centres in the US where I was accompanied by 
Bob Ramsdell, Chief Safety Officer of our North America business.  
A review of this trip can be found on page 67.
Safety
Safety continues to be our highest priority and a strong safety  
culture exists throughout the business. Overall responsibility for  
safety lies with the Group Chief Executive supported by Divisional 
Managing Directors, the Group’s Safety Director and local safety 
teams. It is they who set the annual plans and priorities for continued 
improvement and progress against these is reviewed by the Chief 
Executive’s Safety Committee on a quarterly basis. 
In recognising the ongoing strategic importance of safety to the 
Group, the Remuneration Committee increased the safety element 
weighting of the annual bonus for the Executive Directors from  
10% to 18% of salary in 2017; the emphasis continues this year. 
Additionally, a revised safety underpin for the annual bonus plan and 
a new safety underpin for the LTIP is proposed to be introduced as 
part of the Company’s new Directors’ Remuneration Policy – see 
pages 74 to 84.
Performance
The Committee is extremely pleased to report that the Group’s safety 
performance for responsible accidents showed further year-on-year 
improvement in processes, procedures and outcomes in 2017.  
Most notably, there was a material reduction in our Fatalities Weighted 
Injuries Index (‘FWI’) score and a significant reduction in the number 
of major injuries and lost time injuries. Our FWI per million miles 
travelled is now at an all-time low, in line with the Group’s 2020 target, 
having fallen by 74% since our Driving Out Harm programme was  
first launched in 2010. A truly excellent achievement. However,  
the executive is far from complacent and believes there is further 
safety improvement to come from this year’s strengthening of the 
programme and the investments we are making in our safety 
systems, as outlined below. Additionally, the Committee 
wholeheartedly supports the Group-wide ‘Target Zero’ safety 
campaign recently launched and confirming that any fatality is 
unacceptable.
Accountability continued

Committee Report
Chris Muntwyler  
Committee Chair
64 Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC Corporate Governance Report Arising from the late 2016 Chattanooga school bus accident, a US 
Department of Transportation (‘DOT’) audit undertaken during the 
year identified some driver testing and record keeping shortfalls 
(unrelated to the causes of the accident) and these have been fully 
addressed. Consequently, the DOT confirmed our operating licence in 
Durham as wholly unconditional, which is the highest rating available. 
Driving Out Harm
The Group has operated well established Global Safety Standards for 
many years. As we seek to move these forward, we are harnessing 
the power of digital to achieve a transformation in our ability to 
manage our people and make us best in industry. To that end, we 
further strengthened our Driving Out Harm programme during the 
year with the introduction of the following five new Global Safety 
Policies in April: 
 – Speed Management
 – Driving Evaluation
 – Competence Requirements: Driving Evaluations
 – Driver Monitoring 
 – Driver Performance Management. 
Divisional plans are in place for full implementation of the policies by 
2020 and the Committee has received validation of progress against 
key milestones from the internal audit function. It has also seen 
evidence of the benefits to be derived from the new policies,  
for example:
 – there has been a significant reduction in speeding in each of our 
territories resulting from the introduction of continuous driver 
monitoring versus posted speed limits. This information is also 
enabling us to identify and eradicate all types of driver risk 
distractions; and
 – through our World Class Driver programme, the number of Master 
Drivers in the Group (who are assessed to externally accredited 
standards – in the UK, with the Institute of Advanced Motorists) has 
risen to 700.
Safety systems 
Our safety investment programme continues at a pace. The 
installation of Lytx DriveCam, an incident alert system provided  
by an on-board camera, as part of our World Class Driver training 
programme, continues to be rolled out across the Group. At the  
end of the year, all buses and coaches in the UK had been fitted 
with this new technology, 6,351 in North America and fitment in  
Spain had commenced, with 1,000 planned to be fitted there in 2018. 
Another 9,800 buses will be fitted in North America this year. Of vital 
importance is the coaching of every driver who triggers a recorded 
event (by braking harshly, swerving or through collision) and the 
Committee has noted that this hands-on and immediate response 
approach is starting to change driver behaviour. 
The implementation of a Group-wide system to facilitate and support 
the central management of customer complaints is also taking place. 
This is already live in North America and scheduled to be live across 
the rest of the Group later this year. 
The Committee can see the added value of the Group’s investment  
in these new systems which will help us continue to improve both  
the effectiveness and efficiency of our driving standards and  
safety programmes. 
Safety awards
The Committee was pleased to learn of several safety awards 
received again across the Group in 2017. Of particular note was  
the prestigious:
 – British Safety Council’s Sword of Honour, which recognises the 
commitment to excellent health and safety management standards. 
This was received by UK bus for the second successive year  
(with the highest score of any transport company in 2017) 
and by UK coach for the third successive year. Both companies are 
also now certified to BS OHSAS 18001; and
 – Fundación MAPFRE ‘Award for Best Accident Prevention Initiative’, 
which was awarded to our Spanish business, ALSA. This was in 
recognition of its World Class Driver project (part of the Group-wide 
programme) targeted at reducing risks by improving driver skills. 
The award was received by Jorge Cosmen from Queen Sofia  
of Spain, and is the first time the award has been won by  
a private company. 
These types of external recognition and accreditation give the 
Committee great confidence in the embedded nature and robustness 
of our safety management arrangements across the whole Group. 
Safety is and always will be the 
highest priority for our business,  
Dean Finch will see to that. We  
are good at it, not complacent  
and always striving to be better.

Corporate Governance Report Environment
We recognise that the Company has an important role to play in 
enabling and delivering climate change strategies which, in 
partnership with our partners and other stakeholders, can help 
mitigate the impact arising from the operation of our vehicles and 
sites. Accordingly, the Committee has continued to monitor the 
Group’s strategy and approach to the environment, as well as the 
external reporting of its environmental performance, including 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
With respect to the management of the Company’s environmental 
responsibilities, I am pleased to report that the Group maintained  
full environmental legislative compliance, with zero prosecutions, 
enforcement notices or reported violations in 2017. 
During the year, we continued to make good progress with our 
Driving Excellence in Environmental Performance programme.  
We have set ourselves some challenging KPIs through to 2018  
and against that our water usage and total carbon emissions 
improvements are running well ahead of target though our targeted 
reduction in site emissions has not yet been met. The focus on 
employee engagement continues, with fleet efficiency and improving 
miles per gallon fuel usage remaining key deliverables in all divisions. 
Significant improvements continue to be maintained through fleet 
investment, technology and improvement in driving skills.
Our UK businesses were again accredited with a Gold Standard for 
the Carbon Saver scheme and a number of other notable awards 
were received elsewhere across the Group. These awards are a 
testament to our seven-year programme of reducing carbon 
emmission through a continued commitment to driving sustainability, 
reducing energy costs and adopting carbon emissions reduction 
measures in both our fleet and site operations. 
Health and wellbeing
During the year, the Committee reviewed the significant amount of 
work being undertaken across the Group as we continue to promote, 
support and deliver a multitude of health and wellbeing activities for 
employees, comprising a mix of physical, mental and occupational 
services. Examples of these included:
 – in the US, a new three-year Health and Wellbeing Strategy 
launched in 2017. The first-year focus was on employee education 
and awareness of the various programmes available while the 
second-year focus will shift to prevention, with the objective of 
driving engagement in biometric screenings and other preventative 
measures;
 – in Spain, an online sports, health and wellbeing platform, 
SPORTSNET. This gives employees up-to-date information on  
local sports activities as well as bulletins on food and health.  
The platform aims to boost healthy habits, especially through 
physical exercise; 
 – in Bahrain, two medical clinics are operated on site, one at the 
main staff accommodation and one at the Isa Town Depot. These 
provide free consultations with visiting health specialists from local 
hospitals on a regular basis; and
 – in the UK, our continuing award-winning Health Bus. This provides 
health monitoring services to employees and in 2017 facilitated 
over 5,000 appointments.
Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s operations and activities formed part of the  
external review of Board effectiveness performed in the year  
(see pages 50 and 51) and which confirmed that the Committee 
continues to operate very well and effectively in providing oversight  
of safety and governance. 
Looking forward
In 2018, the Committee will continue to monitor and review the 
structure, content and operation of the Group’s safety management 
and environment arrangements, and the actions being taken by the 
executive to achieve the Group’s objectives on both fronts.

Committee in action 
The Board believes the Company should aim to lead the industry on 
safety and continuously seek to improve our standards. Our safety 
agenda is aligned to that – led from the top and embedded in 
everything we do – and a rigorous governance framework underpins 
our approach. The Executive and Non-Executive Directors are regular 
visitors to our Customer Service Centres (‘CSCs’) to make sure we 
‘walk the talk’ from the boardroom to our operations.
Chris Muntwyler, Chair of our Safety & Environment Committee, 
visited six student transportation and public transit CSCs in New York 
and Connecticut in February this year. Accompanied by Bob 
Ramsdell, the North American Chief Safety Officer, he met with local 
management and personnel and toured each centre looking into the 
safety processes in place, including driver coaching through the use 
of our smart camera system, DriveCam, reduction in speeding using 
GPS reports, facility safety, and vehicle maintenance and 
environmental procedures. 
Discussions with drivers, mechanics, site managers and other staff 
enabled Chris to gauge the effectiveness of these programmes and 
the level of implementation at each centre.

see in person how our strategic safety 
programmes are being implemented and 
followed on the front-line, as well as the 
impact they have on reducing accidents 
and injuries. These visits give me a unique 
opportunity to meet and talk to National 
Express staff at all levels and hear their 
perspectives on what works well and  
where there is still room for improvement. 
This real-world view helps me make 
meaningful contributions to our overall 
safety effort as Chair of the Safety

Dear fellow Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. 
It has been another very successful year for the Group and a busy one 
for the Remuneration Committee. We have assessed outcomes under 
incentive plans, approved certain aspects of remuneration for two 
Executive Director changes that occurred, and have conducted a full 
review of the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The Company  
is seeking shareholders’ approval to a new policy at the AGM in May.
Aligning pay and performance in 2017
2017 was a standout year for the Group, where our performance 
again delivered record breaking results. Our share price increased  
by 8% ahead of sector competitors and a 10% increase in the final 
dividend is proposed. The financial highlights table opposite shows 
our strong performance compared to last year as we delivered in 
excess of plan on all key metrics. In addition to this, the Executive 
Directors made significant progress on a number of strategic  
projects with tangible results, most notably in relation to the 
divestment of our UK rail franchise and the consequential 
restructuring of the UK business.
The Committee has undergone a robust and full assessment  
of performance, taking into account financial and non-financial 
measures. In addition, we considered (in consultation with the Safety 
& Environment Committee) the Group’s performance in relation  
to safety processes, procedures and outcomes for 2017 and judged 
that the annual bonus underpin had been fully satisfied given the 
continuing year-on-year improvement delivered. Particularly pleasing 
is our Fatalities Weighted Injuries Index (‘FWI’) score per million miles 
travelled which is now at an all-time low having fallen by 74% since 
our Driving Out Harm programme was launched in 2010.
Consequently, the following outcomes were approved  
by the Committee:
 – annual bonuses of 95% of maximum for 2017, of which a portion 
has been deferred into shares. No discretion was used by the 
Committee in determining these bonuses;
 – 96.7% of maximum vesting for the LTIP awards with a three-year 
performance period ended 31 December 2017. These are due  
to vest in March 2018; and
 – 73.4% of maximum vesting for the legacy LTIP award made to 
the Group Chief Executive with a five-year performance period  
ended 31 December 2017. This is due to vest in May 2018.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance
Following the tragic accident in Chattanooga in late 2016, the 
Committee has continued to monitor ongoing investigations. I am 
pleased to confirm that no new findings have arisen since February 
2017 that would then, or indeed now, lead the Committee to apply 
anything other than the same judgement or reach anything other 
than the same decision in respect of last year’s bonus payments to 
the Executives. However, we have reviewed and revised the safety 
underpin wording in the annual bonus as part of this year’s policy 
review. In addition, a significant and increased portion of the 
non-financial element of the bonus (18% out of 25%) was devoted to 
safety metrics and the delivery of related key plans and investments 
for 2017. This weighting level will be maintained in 2018.
Overall, the Committee believes that the outcomes of the bonus and 
LTIP fully reflect the strong underlying performance of the business as 
well as the strong results for shareholders delivered over the last five 
years which include a Total Shareholder Return of 134% and basic 
statutory EPS growth of 118%.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy review
Following a number of substantial changes made to executive 
remuneration in 2015, our current policy was approved by 
shareholders with an overwhelming 99% vote of support at that year’s 
AGM. Since then, we have successfully used the policy to reward and 
retain a high-quality executive team, under the leadership of Dean 
Finch, which has and is continuing to deliver record performance  
as it executes on an ambitious strategy.
The Committee’s objective in approaching this year’s policy review 
has been to ensure that the remuneration structure continues to 
support our strategy, incentivise our executive team to achieve 
stretching targets, and to balance this against the need to be sensitive 
to shareholder requirements and corporate governance best practice.
The Committee considered alternative remuneration structures  
but concluded that the current one achieves our objectives and it 
therefore remains fit for purpose without the need for any significant 
changes. In particular, we can see that the current structure aligns  
the executives’ interests with those of our shareholders over the  
long term.
However, to ensure the policy continues to meet governance 
guidelines and provides flexibility in dealing with certain scenarios and 
events which could occur during the intended three-year term of the 
new policy, the Committee is proposing to make a few incremental 
changes to the way the policy is operated for Executives. In line with 
good practice, and before finalising the new policy, the Committee 
consulted on these changes with major shareholders representing 
some 74% of our share register, and the main institutional proxy voting 
agencies, at the end of last year/early this year.
The proposed changes included:
 – a reduction in the maximum pension contribution for new Executive 
Directors to no more than 25% of salary;
 – revision of the safety underpin for the annual bonus and the 
introduction of a similar safety underpin for the LTIP; and
 – removal of the ability to use the Listing Rules to make exceptional 
LTIP awards, and the introduction of the flexibility to grant LTIP 
awards up to 200% of salary for all Executives in special 
circumstances.
2017 financial performance highlights
– Group revenue £2.32 billion, up 10.9%
– Normalised profit before tax £200m, up 18.6%
– Statutory profit after tax £128.4m, up 11.7%
– Free cash flow £146.4m, up 5.6%
–  Normalised basic earnings per share 29.1p, up 10.6%

Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 70
The changes were very well received by shareholders and in 
response to our engagement with them, the Committee also made 
the following further amendments to those originally proposed:
 – reduction in the threshold level of LTIP vesting from 30% to 25%  
for the TSR and EPS elements;
 – extension of the application of malus and clawback to the whole of 
the annual bonus award, not just the deferred share element; and
 – reduction in the Group Chief Executive’s annual pension allowance 
from 35% to 30% of salary in three equal tranches commencing 
from 2019.
A summary of all the key changes proposed to the current policy is 
set out in the table on page 73 and the proposed new policy is set  
out in full on pages 74 to 84.
The Committee is confident that the current policy remains fit for 
purpose, subject to the incremental changes being proposed, 
and fundamental in helping us achieve continued strong business 
performance. The new policy is therefore recommended to 
shareholders for approval at the AGM in May.
Executive team changes
The number of Executive Directors increased and the team 
strengthened during the year by the appointment of Chris Davies as 
Group Finance Director in June and the appointment of Matt Ashley 
(the former Group Finance Director) to the role of President and  
CEO of our North America business in September 2017. Chris was 
appointed on the same remuneration package, terms and conditions 
as his predessor and Matt moved to Chicago with no changes to  
his package. Full details of their remuneration and the relocation 
assistance provided to Matt are set out on pages 85 and 86.
2018 remuneration and the wider pay environment
I continue to be encouraged by management’s commitment to invest 
in staff at all levels and our commitment to always meet or exceed 
national minimum standards of employment in all of our business 
areas offering pay, terms and conditions that are appropriate to each 
labour market in which we operate.
The Committee has recently completed its annual review of salary 
and can confirm that for 2018 the base salary increase for each of 
the Executive Directors will be 2.5%, in line with that of the wider  
UK workforce.
There will be no change to the award opportunity for bonus or LTIP 
arrangements in 2018. The structure and performance conditions will 
be operated as per the current policy and the 2017 plans, as detailed 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s effectiveness and activities formed part of the 
external review of Board effectiveness performed in the year. Details 
of this review are provided on pages 50 and 51. Overall, the 
Committee continued to operate effectively and to a high standard 
having delivered on a significant agenda during the year.
Looking forward
We will continue to engage with shareholders and review corporate 
governance best practice as it develops. In that regard, the 
Committee acknowledges that a new corporate governance code 
is in preparation and, together with the whole Board, will look to 
pro-actively respond to developments arising from this as part of 
its 2018 agenda.
I hope that you find the information contained in this report helpful, 
thoughtful and clear. I welcome any feedback from shareholders and 
look forward to answering any questions at the AGM when we will be 
asking shareholders to approve our new policy and the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.

Introduction
In this section, we highlight:
 – the linkage between our strategic initiatives and the various elements of remuneration being used to drive and incentivise their  
achievement; and
 – the annual bonus and LTIP targets for performance periods ended 31 December 2017, the Company’s performance against each of them, 
and the resulting bonus payouts and LTIP vesting levels as a proportion of the maximum opportunity for the Executive Directors in 2017.
More details can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 85 to 99.
Remuneration link to strategy
Our focus is to deliver long-term success for the business and shareholders and we seek to achieve this through various strategic initiatives. 
These are set out below together with the corresponding element of remuneration targeted to drive and incentivise their achievement.
Strategic initiatives Remuneration element
Revenue growth Normalised profit before tax target in the annual bonus plan 
EPS target attaching to LTIP awards
Cost efficiency and better margins ROCE and TSR targets attaching to LTIP awards
Operational excellence – safety, customers, people, community Non-financial goals in the annual bonus plan
Superior cash and returns Free cash flow target in the annual bonus plan 
ROCE and TSR targets attaching to LTIP awards
Creating new business opportunities Non-financial goals in the annual bonus plan
A minimum shareholding requirement of 200% of salary exists for the Group Chief Executive and 150% of salary for the other Executive Directors. This aligns their 
interests with those of shareholders by focusing them on the execution of the business strategy and the creation of long-term shareholder value. 
Principles of remuneration
Our current Directors’ Remuneration Policy is based on the following broad principles set by the Committee:
 – provide a competitive remuneration package to attract and retain quality individuals;
 – align remuneration to drive the overall objectives of the business;
 – align the interests of management with the interests of shareholders; and
 – provide the foundation for overall reward and remuneration beyond the specific roles falling within the direct remit of the Committee.
A new Directors’ Remuneration Policy is being recommended to shareholders at this year’s AGM (see page 74).

Corporate Governance Report  
Summary of the key changes proposed to 
the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 73
A summary of the key changes proposed to the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, is set out 
below and relates only to the operation of the executive remuneration structure. These are the changes on which the Company consulted with 
its major shareholders.
Further details regarding the operation of the current policy in 2017 can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 85 to 99.
Element Proposed change Rationale for change
Base salary – clarification Changes to clarify operation of the circumstances 
in which above employee salary increases or above 
market median salary may be necessary.
To provide flexibility in cases of material changes 
in responsibility or below-market pay, or to reward 
significant experience and proven performance.
Annual bonus – malus and clawback Extension of malus and clawback to apply to the 
whole of the bonus award, not just the deferred  
share element.
To normalise the application of malus and clawback 
in line with best practice.
Annual bonus – underpin Revision of safety underpin wording for  
2018 onwards.
To ensure that the Committee has the ability  
to make appropriate downward adjustments  
to bonus and LTIP vesting outcomes in  
specified circumstances.
LTIP – underpin Introduction of safety underpin to future LTIP awards.
LTIP – grant size Introduction of the ability to grant annual LTIP awards 
to all Executives up to 200% of salary (currently, the 
maximum is 150% of salary for Executives, other 
than the Group Chief Executive who is already entitled 
to a 200% of salary maximum annual award).
To provide for future developments and to 
address retention, incentive and succession 
planning matters over the expected three-year  
term of the policy.
LTIP – threshold vesting level Reduce the threshold level of LTIP vesting from 30% 
to 25% of maximum for TSR and EPS elements.
To normalise the threshold level of vesting in line 
with best practice and to incentivise a focus on 
outperformance.
LTIP – recruitment/retention awards Removal of the ability to make use of the Listing Rules 
provision to make exceptional awards in retention or 
recruitment scenarios.
To ensure that all future LTIP awards are made 
under the approved remuneration policy in line  
with best practice.
Pension – new Executive Directors Reduction in the maximum annual pension  
allowance for new Executives to no more than  
25% of base salary. 
To normalise pension provision for all Executive 
Directors over time.
Pension – Group Chief Executive Reduction in the annual pension allowance from  
35% to 30% of base salary in three equal tranches 
commencing from 2019.
To move this specific legacy pension arrangement 
more into line with current market practice.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 74
1. Introduction to the policy
This new policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 16 May 2018 and, if approved, will be effective immediately thereafter 
(in place of the current policy approved at the 2015 AGM which will continue to apply until such time). It is intended that the new policy will 
remain in force until the Company’s AGM in 2021 and there are no planned changes to it over the three-year period to which it applies.
The new policy is very similar to the current one, save for the incremental changes to the way it is operated for Executives as summarised on 
page 73. The remuneration linkage to strategy, through its structure and individual elements (as described on page 71), remains unchanged.
2. Considerations when setting and determining the policy
The Committee’s primary objective when setting the new policy is to align remuneration to the long-term success of the business and 
shareholders while at the same time enabling the Company to effectively recruit, motivate and retain key individuals. To achieve this, the 
Committee takes into account the responsibilities, experience, performance and contribution of the individual, as well as levels of remuneration 
for individuals in comparable roles elsewhere. The Committee also takes into account the views expressed by shareholders and institutional 
investors’ best practice expectations, and monitors developments in remuneration trends. The policy places significant emphasis on the need 
to achieve stretching and rigorously applied performance targets, with a significant proportion of remuneration weighted towards performance-
linked variable pay.
The Company does not formally consult with employees on executive remuneration. However, when setting the remuneration policy for 
Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the overall approach to pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
3. Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee is committed to maintaining strong relationships and an open dialogue with shareholders and shareholder bodies and  
to encourage them to share their thoughts with us. The Committee also values investors’ views in the process of formulating remuneration 
policy decisions.
The Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the current remuneration policy during the year to ensure it remains appropriate and fit 
for purpose in light of both the Company’s strategy and developments in corporate governance and best practice expectations of investors.  
In doing so, it engaged with shareholders holding more than 70% of the Company’s shares, as well as the leading shareholder advisory bodies, 
on the key changes proposed, as set out in the summary table on page 73. This helped the Committee to understand their views and formulate 
the final policy. The changes were very well received and in response to our engagement with shareholders, the Committee made the following 
further amendments to those originally proposed:
 – reduction in the threshold level of LTIP vesting from 30% to 25% for the TSR and EPS elements;
 – extension of the application of malus and clawback to the whole of the annual bonus award, not just the deferred share element; and
 – reduction in the Group Chief Executive’s current annual pension allowance from 35% to 30% of salary in three equal tranches commencing 
from 2019.
The Committee will continue to spend time each year considering feedback received at the AGM and throughout the year as part of its ongoing 
review of policy. We are grateful for the time, assistance and support shareholders give us.

4. Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors
4.1 Summary of the individual elements of the policy for Executive Directors
Element
How element supports  
business strategy Operation Maximum potential value
Performance conditions  
and assessment
Base salary To provide base salaries which:
 – reflect the value of the 
Executive’s experience, 
skills, knowledge and 
contribution, and importance 
to the business; and 
 – help attract, retain and 
motivate high performing 
Executives of the calibre 
required to lead the business 
and successfully implement 
the strategy, but without 
paying more than is 
necessary to do so.
Base salaries are paid monthly 
in cash and normally reviewed 
annually with effect from 
1 January. Reviews cover 
individual performance, 
experience, development in the 
role and market comparisons.
To determine market 
comparisons the Committee 
reviews remuneration data  
on executive positions against 
comparator groups consisting 
of transport/leisure and general 
sector companies of similar 
size, complexity and 
international presence.  
The Committee retains the 
discretion to amend the 
comparator groups as 
necessary to remain relevant.
Whilst there is no prescribed 
formulaic maximum, base 
salaries will reflect:
 – the Executive’s role;
 – the job size and 
responsibility; and
 – the performance and 
effectiveness of the 
individual.
In addition, when reviewing 
Executive salaries, 
consideration will always be 
given to the approach to 
employee pay across the Group 
and the general performance of 
the Company. Therefore, salary 
increases for Executives will not 
normally exceed the general 
employee increase for the 
country in which the individual 
is domiciled. However, larger 
increases or above median 
salaries may be necessary, for 
example (but without limitation):
 – where there has been a 
material increase in the 
scope and/or scale of the 
Executive’s responsibility  
in the role (including  
internal promotion);
 – to apply salary progression 
for a recently appointed 
Executive who has been 
appointed on a salary  
below the market level; and
 – where an Executive is 
extremely experienced and 
has a long track record of 
proven performance. In  
such circumstances, salaries 
may need to be in the upper 
quartile of comparable 
companies of similar size 
and complexity.
No increase would exceed  
10% above RPI in any one year, 
except for internal promotion  
or where the Executive’s salary 
is below the market level.
Where such exceptional 
changes do occur, they will be 
fully disclosed and explained.
Not applicable.

Pension To provide a competitive 
pension and funds that  
enable Executives to  
save for retirement.
Pension benefits are a fixed 
element of remuneration.
Executive Directors receive  
a cash allowance in lieu of a 
pension provision in line with 
market practice.
The current Group Chief 
Executive receives a 35% of 
salary annual cash allowance. 
The other Executive Directors 
receive a 25% of salary annual 
cash allowance.
Only base salary counts for  
the purpose of the allowance.
The Committee’s policy is that 
the maximum annual cash 
allowance payable in lieu of  
a pension provision will be  
35% of base salary reducing  
to 30% in three equal tranches 
commencing from 2019.  
For new Executive Directors, 
the annual cash allowance  
will be no more than 25%  
of base salary.
Not applicable.
Benefits To provide competitive benefits 
as part of fixed remuneration to 
enable the Group to recruit and 
retain highly performing 
Executives.
Executive Directors receive a 
combination of family private 
healthcare, death-in-service 
and life assurance cover  
(4x salary), long-term sickness  
and disability insurance, car 
allowance, free travel on the 
Company’s services and 
professional membership 
subscriptions. They are also 
entitled to travel, subsistence 
and accommodation for 
business purposes.
The Committee has discretion 
to provide additional benefits  
or remove benefits in order to 
remain competitive or to meet 
the needs of the business; for 
example, to provide relocation 
assistance to an Executive 
Director (and his/her family), 
including financial, tax and  
legal advice if applicable. Any 
change to benefit provisions will 
be detailed on an annual basis.
The cost to the Company of 
providing the benefits may vary 
from year to year in accordance 
with market conditions. This  
will therefore determine the 
maximum amount that would 
be paid in the form of benefits 
to Executives during the  
policy period.

Annual bonus To incentivise delivery of 
near-term performance 
objectives which are directly 
linked to the financial and 
strategic priorities of the 
business.
A portion of any bonus paid is 
deferred into shares, assisting 
the retention of Executives and 
further aligning their interests 
with those of shareholders.
Bonus payments are based on 
the achievement of pre-
specified corporate objectives, 
both financial and non-financial 
(including personal) over a 
one-year performance period.
A proportion of the bonus 
payment is subject to 
mandatory deferral (gross) into 
shares for one year from award 
as follows:
 – 25% of the bonus earned  
up to 125% of salary;
 – 50% of the bonus earned 
between 125% to 150% of 
salary; and
 – 75% of the bonus earned 
above 150% of salary 
(applicable to Group Chief 
Executive only).
Dividends or dividend 
equivalents (which may assume 
notional re-investment) are paid 
on the deferred share element.
The Remuneration Committee 
retains the discretion to 
standardise the percentage of 
the bonus deferred into shares 
if this is deemed appropriate  
in the future.
Unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, the 
market price per share on  
the date of the award will be 
calculated on the basis of the 
average share price in the five 
days preceding the date of  
the grant.
From the 2019 bonus year, 
malus and clawback provisions 
attach to the whole of the 
bonus award and apply to the 
two-year period post award, 
including following cessation  
of employment.
Only the Executives currently 
participate in the Company’s 
bonus deferral arrangements. 
Other senior management 
members may be invited to 
participate in future years at  
the Committee’s discretion.
Achievement of each element 
of the bonus is assessed 
independently.
Bonus payments are paid 
following announcement  
of the Company’s audited  
year end results and are  
not pensionable.
Maximum 200% of base salary 
for the Group Chief Executive 
and 150% of base salary for 
other Executive Directors.
The targets for the bonus in respect  
of 2018 are as follows:
 – 75% subject to normalised profit 
and free cash flow targets; and
 – 25% subject to non-financial targets.
The Committee retains discretion in 
exceptional circumstances to amend 
the weightings of the financial and 
non-financial elements of the bonus 
from year to year and for each 
Executive as appropriate.
The targets attached to the financial 
condition will typically relate to profit 
and/or cash generation, are set on an 
annual basis and are intended to be 
achievable at threshold and stretching 
at maximum.
The numerical values of the 
performance targets will not be 
disclosed in advance (except for  
safety) as the Committee considers 
this information commercially sensitive. 
Actual targets, performance achieved 
and awards will be published at the 
end of the performance period in order 
that shareholders can fully assess the 
basis for any pay outs under the  
annual bonus.
The non-financial targets will be set 
annually based on strategic objectives 
for the year as set out in the Strategic 
Report. These include safety, 
operational, business development, 
customer and talent development/
employee related metrics and will be 
determined by the Committee on an 
annual basis. The proportion of the 
bonus determined by performance 
against non-financial targets will only 
become payable when the Company 
achieves a threshold level of 
normalised profit.
The annual bonus includes an underpin 
that enables the Remuneration 
Committee to use its discretion, acting 
reasonably and proportionately, to 
scale back the annual bonus outcome, 
including to nil. This underpin applies  
if, as a result of the systematic failure  
of management to put in place and 
operate effective safety processes, a 
significant negative event occurs that 
has a material adverse impact on both 
the reputation of the Company and its 
share price. Additionally, to the extent 
that legal, regulatory or other 
investigations are ongoing in relation to 
such an event, the Committee has the 
discretion to delay the payment of a 
bonus (in whole or in part) until those 
investigations are completed.

options or forfeitable shares) 
are granted annually with 
vesting subject to the 
achievement of performance 
conditions measured over a 
three-year consecutive financial 
period commencing with the 
year of award.
An additional two-year holding 
period exists on vested LTIP 
awards of the Executive 
Directors in order to increase 
the alignment of their interests 
with those of shareholders.
Dividend equivalents can be 
paid (gross) on vested shares 
during both the vesting and 
holding periods.
Awards are reviewed annually 
to ensure that grant levels, 
performance criteria and other 
features remain appropriate to 
the Company’s current 
circumstances.
Pursuant to Schedule 4 of  
the Income Tax (Earnings  
and Pensions) Act 2003, and 
while providing no additional 
remuneration (only tax 
efficiency in delivery of the 
vested LTIP awards), the 
Company may also grant to  
the Executives a market value 
approved Company Share 
Option Plan (‘CSOP’) option 
(with a maximum face value  
of £30,000) when such 
opportunity is available  
to them individually.
Malus and clawback provisions 
attach to all vested LTIP awards 
and apply to the two-year 
period post vesting, including 
following cessation of 
employment.
The Group Chief Executive is 
eligible to receive a conditional 
LTIP award of up to 200% of 
salary per annum.
The normal maximum LTIP 
award for other Executives  
is 150% of salary per annum. 
However, in special 
circumstances, and to address 
retention, incentive and 
succession planning matters, 
an LTIP award of up to 200%  
of salary may also be granted 
to other Executives in any  
one year.
Awards will be subject to stretching 
performance targets over a period  
of three consecutive financial years.
The Committee may change the 
balance of the measures, or use 
different measures for subsequent 
awards, as appropriate. No material 
change will be made to the type of 
performance conditions without prior 
shareholder consultation.
For 2018, the performance measures 
for LTIP awards will be based equally 
as follows:
 – 1/3 earnings per share (‘EPS’);
 – 1/3 return on capital employed 
(‘ROCE’); and
 – 1/3 total shareholder return, split 
50/50 between the constituents of 
the FTSE 250 Index and a bespoke 
index comprising a small group  
of competitor companies (‘TSR’).
Achievement of threshold performance 
in respect of the EPS and TSR targets 
results in a 25% vesting for each part  
of the award. Achievement of threshold 
performance in respect of the ROCE 
target results in 0% vesting.
There is no ability to retest any of the 
performance conditions.
The LTIP includes an underpin that 
enables the Remuneration Committee 
to use its discretion, acting reasonably 
and proportionately, to scale back the 
level of vesting, including to nil, in any 
financial year. The underpin applies  
if, as a result of the systematic failure  
of management to put in place and 
operate effective safety processes,  
a significant negative event occurs 
during the vesting period, that has a 
material adverse impact on both the 
reputation of the Company and its 
share price. Additionally, to the  
extent that legal, regulatory or other 
investigations are ongoing in relation  
to such an event, the Committee  
has the discretion to delay the LTIP 
vesting (in whole or in part) until those 
investigations are completed.
The Committee also retains discretion 
under the LTIP rules to amend  
existing performance conditions to 
take account of any events that may 
arise which would mean in its opinion, 
if such adjustments were not made,  
the performance condition would 
not constitute a fair measure of the 
Company’s performance over the 
measurement period.

Shareholding requirement
This policy element ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are closely aligned with those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are encouraged to build up a shareholding over a five-year period commencing from the later of 2015 (when the provision 
was first introduced) and their date of appointment. The required holding value for the Group Chief Executive is equivalent to 200% of base 
salary and for the other Executives is 150% of base salary. Adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued participation in the 
Company’s LTIP and other equity incentive arrangements. The Committee retains discretion to increase the shareholding requirement over  
the life of the policy and will have regard to LTIP award levels when using this discretion.
4.2 Previous arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy, authority is sought by the Company to honour any outstanding commitments (subject to 
existing terms, conditions and plan rules, as applicable) entered into with current or former Directors (as previously disclosed to shareholders) 
before this policy took effect or before they became a Director.
4.3 Performance conditions under the Annual Bonus Plan
Normalised PBT, free cash flow and non-financial measures were chosen for the annual bonus plan as appropriate measures of the Group’s 
short-term performance. The table below summarises the rationale for the selection of each element.
Measure Rationale for performance measure
Normalised PBT – A primary measure of the success of the Group in growing the business
 – The profit definition for the annual bonus is pre tax and excludes other items over which management  
have limited control, such as exchange rate charges, to ensure that the target represents a fair measure  
of management performance
Free cash flow – Determines how efficiently the Group generates cash to fund its outgoings and to finance investment
 – Free cash flow is a key driver for generating shareholder value
Non-financial measures – Non-financial metrics ensure that management are measured on a broader range of safety, strategic, people and  
operational targets
 – Safety is of paramount importance to our business and therefore appropriate that management are incentivised  
to maintain and improve safety processes
 – Strategic measures include business development and customer targets which ensure that management take the 
right actions now to grow the business in future and to maintain high levels of customer service
 – People are the Group’s primary asset. Developing them, including today’s talent and tomorrow’s leaders, is of 
paramount importance to the business
 – Other metrics will be used to support business initiatives and these may change through the life of the policy
4.4 Performance conditions under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan
EPS, TSR and ROCE were chosen for the 2015 LTIP as appropriate measures of the Group’s long-term performance. The table below 
summarises the rationale for the selection of each element.
Measure Rationale for performance measure
EPS – Important growth measure considered within the Company and a driver of shareholder value
 – Provides a transparent and accessible method of gauging the financial performance of the Company 
 – Ensures the annual profit performance targeted by the annual bonus plan flows through to long-term  
sustainable growth
 – The Company calculates performance against this measure by reference to the earnings per share figures reported  
in the Company’s audited accounts
TSR – Improves shareholder alignment
 – Consistent with the Company’s objective of providing superior long-term returns to shareholders
ROCE – Demonstrates how efficiently the Company is operating with the resources available
If the Committee changes the performance conditions within the life of the policy, it will consult with shareholders in advance on the changes  
to be made and the reason for doing so.

4.5 Total remuneration opportunity at various levels of performance
Our aim is to ensure that superior awards are only paid for exceptional performance, with a substantial proportion of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration payable in the form of variable pay. The charts below illustrate the remuneration opportunity provided to each Executive Director 
at different levels of performance for the coming year.
The elements of remuneration have been categorised into three components: (i) Fixed; (ii) Annual variable; and (iii) Long-term incentives, which 
are set out in the future policy table below.
Element Descriptions
Fixed – Latest base salary, pension allowance and benefits
Annual variable – Performance-related annual bonus (including deferred element)
Long-term incentives – Long-Term Incentive Plan award
Assumptions used in determining the level of pay out under the given scenarios are as follows:
 – Salaries are those set as at 1 January 2018
 – Benefits are those paid in 2017 (but excludes the relocation costs for Matt Ashley)
 – LTIP awards are granted at the normal annual level under the policy
 – The Minimum performance level assumes fixed pay only and no variable payments
 – The On-target performance level assumes performance in line with the Company’s expectations, resulting in threshold LTIP vesting and 50% 
of maximum annual bonus payout. (While the bonus plan has targets for threshold, on-target and maximum, the LTIP only has targets for 
threshold and maximum for some metrics. The value shown above for the On-target level includes the values for on-target bonus and 
threshold LTIP performance.)
 – The Maximum performance level assumes an outstanding level of performance (ie maximum annual bonus and full LTIP vesting)
 – Share price appreciation is ignored.

4.6 Comparison with approach to remuneration across the Group
The Group operates across a number of countries and accordingly sets terms and conditions for employees which reflect the different 
legislative requirements and labour market conditions that exist in each country. We set Global People Standards to provide a framework for 
recognition and rewards internationally. We will always meet or exceed national minimum standards of employment in all of our business areas 
offering pay, terms and conditions that are appropriate to each labour market in which we operate. Base pay is set at a level that allows us to 
recruit and retain staff in each relevant labour market and performance-related pay arrangements are based on the achievement of business 
unit and individual goals, objectively assessed. National Express believes in the value of continuous improvement, both for the individual and  
for the Company.
The Group offers pension and pension savings arrangements to its employees appropriate for the labour markets in which it operates. In the 
UK, in line with market practice, new employees are offered membership of a Defined Contribution (‘DC’) plan with employer contributions up 
to 15% of salary. The Group also has Defined Benefit (‘DB’) schemes in its UK Bus division with employer contributions ranging between 25% 
and 40% of salary. Historically, a majority of the Group’s UK employees would have been in DB schemes when the Group operated rail 
franchises. With the Group having exited UK rail in 2017, the majority of UK employees are now in the DC plan.
LTIP awards are also provided to selected members of the Senior Management Group to incentivise and reward them for delivering long-term 
value to the Group and shareholders.
The Company did not consult with employees in drawing up the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
4.7 Executive Directors’ Service Agreements
The Executive Directors each have a Service Agreement with the Company and the table below shows the date of those agreements and the 
relevant notice period to be provided by either party in normal circumstances.
Executive Directors
Date of
Service Agreement
Date of
appointment
Notice period
from Company
Notice period
from Director
Dean Finch 16.12.09 15.02.10 12 months 6 months
Matthew Ashley 16.07.15 28.01.15 12 months 6 months
Chris Davies 17.01.17 10.05.17 12 months 6 months
The Service Agreement for Dean Finch, which is a rolling contract, contains a provision, exercisable at the option of the Company, to pay an 
amount on termination of employment equal to one year’s salary, salary supplement in lieu of pension and car allowance. The Director will not 
be obliged to mitigate his loss in relation to any payment in lieu of notice. The Company will use the payment in lieu of notice provisions when 
the speed, certainty and protection of restrictive covenants afforded by such clauses are thought to be in the best interests of the Company 
and the circumstances surrounding his departure justify their use.
The Committee continuously reviews its policies on executive remuneration and severance in the best interests of shareholders. Guidance  
on best practice expectations is taken into account prior to agreeing Directors’ contractual provisions.
The Group Chief Executive is entitled, under an unfunded pension arrangement, to a pension based on the value of notional contributions 
made of 25% of his salary, plus a 5% per annum notional return. The benefits under this arrangement ceased to accrue from 5 June 2016.  
In normal circumstances, the pension is payable, at the earliest, from 1 April 2022, with all or part of it capable of being paid as a lump sum  
at the Company’s discretion.
On a change of control of the Company, outstanding LTIP awards will vest, except to the extent they are exchanged for awards over shares  
in the acquiring company. Vesting will be subject to any performance conditions and will normally be reduced to reflect early vesting, unless  
the Remuneration Committee determines that a reduction in the number of vested shares is considered inappropriate. The number or class  
of shares under award may be adjusted on a rights issue, variation of capital, demerger or similar transaction. Vested LTIP shares subject  
to a holding period (and any outstanding deferred bonus shares) will vest automatically to participants on a change of control.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 82
4.8 Executive Directors’ employment termination arrangements
Same as referred to in 4.7 above, the Company may at its discretion make payment in lieu of notice, which could potentially include up to  
12 months’ base salary, benefits and pension, and which may be subject to payment by instalments and/or mitigation.
The table below sets out the treatment of the elements of remuneration that would normally apply where an Executive Director’s service with 
the Company is terminated:
Reason for termination
Salary, pension and 
contractual benefits Annual bonus
Unvested deferred share 
bonus awards Unvested LTIP awards Other
Good leaver: retirement, 
disability, redundancy, 
death, sale of part of 
Company that employs 
participant or any  
other reason that  
the Remuneration  
Committee determines.
Payment equal to the 
aggregate of the base 
salary and pension 
allowance and the value  
of any contractual benefits 
during the notice period, 
including any accrued but 
untaken holiday.
Bonus awarded (subject  
to the satisfaction of 
performance targets for 
the relevant financial year).
Awards vest on date  
of termination.
Unvested LTIP awards  
will vest on the date of 
termination or on the 
normal vesting date  
as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee.
The amount of an award 
vesting will be subject to 
satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions 
measured as at the date 
the award is deemed  
to vest.
Awards will normally be 
reduced pro rata to reflect 
the time elapsed between 
the date of grant and the 
date of termination.
Fees for 
outplacement 
and legal advice 
may be paid.
Other reasons Paid to date of termination, 
including any accrued but 
untaken holiday.
No awards made for the 
year of termination

 Pursuant to Dean Finch’s Service Agreement dated 16 December 2009, if his contract is terminated for reasons other than for an event of default by the Executive  
(such as gross misconduct), he is entitled, subject to the applicable performance conditions, to a pro rata bonus calculated from the commencement of the relevant  
bonus year in which termination takes place up to the date of termination.
Subject to the circumstances surrounding the termination, the Committee may, in its discretion, treat the Executive as a ’good leaver’  
(in relation to their reason for leaving under the first section of the above table). The Committee will consider factors such as personal 
performance and conduct, overall Company performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive’s departure, including, but not 
limited to, whether the Executive is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company. In addition, the Committee will consider the above 
circumstances in considering whether unvested LTIP awards should be pro-rated for a good leaver to reflect their completed period of  
service since the date of grant.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments to an Executive Director where such payments are made in good faith:
 – to discharge an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or
 – by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of office or employment.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 83
4.9 Approach to the remuneration of newly appointed Executive Directors
In the event that the Company recruits a new Executive Director (either from within the organisation or externally), when determining 
appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including, but not limited to, quantum, 
the type of remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction from which the candidate is being recruited. This is to ensure that the arrangements 
made are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders without paying more than is necessary to recruit an Executive of the 
required calibre.
The Committee’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months. The only exception  
to this is where, in exceptional circumstances, it is deemed necessary to offer a longer notice period initially, reducing down to 12 months,  
in order to secure the appointment of an external recruit.
The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration of any new Executive Director with the same principles as apply for the current 
Executive Directors.
In line with the above policy, the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion in the remuneration package of a new 
Executive Director are:
 – salary and benefits, including a cash allowance in lieu of a pension provision;
 – participation in the performance-related annual bonus of up to 200% of salary (depending on role), pro-rated for the period of service in the 
year of recruitment. If the commencement date is after 1 September, no award would normally be made for that year;
 – participation in the LTIP with award levels applicable for that grade. On appointment, that would be a maximum value of 200% of salary, 
although this may be pro-rated depending on the time of appointment through the year; and
 – costs and outgoings relating to, but not limited to, relocation assistance; legal, financial, tax and visa advice; and pre-employment  
medical checks.
Other elements may be included where an interim appointment is being made to fill an Executive Director role on a short-term basis or similarly 
if the Chairman or a Non-Executive Director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis.
The Committee may also make awards on the appointment of an Executive Director to ‘buy out’ remuneration arrangements being forfeited  
by the individual on leaving a previous employer. The Committee would take into account both market practice and any relevant commercial 
factors in considering whether any enhanced and/or one-off annual incentive or long-term incentive award was appropriate. Awards made by 
way of compensation for forfeited awards would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of performance conditions and achievements 
(or likely achievements), the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award. Compensation could be in the form of 
cash and/or shares. The Committee will not offer any non-performance related incentives payments (for example, a ‘guaranteed signing-on 
bonus’ or ‘golden hello’). Leaver provisions will be determined in line with this policy when ‘buy-out’ awards are made.
4.10 Executive Directors’ external appointments
Board approval is required before any external appointment may be accepted by an Executive Director. If approved, the individual is permitted 
to retain any fees paid in respect of such office or services. At present, none of the Executive Directors hold an external appointment.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 84
5. Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
5.1. Summary of the individual elements of the policy for Non-Executive Directors
Element Purpose Operation Maximum potential value
Fees To attract, retain and motivate high 
performing persons of a suitable 
calibre for a business of this size  
and complexity.
To pay fees which are reflective  
of responsibilities and time 
commitments, competitive  
with peer companies, without  
paying more than is necessary.
The single fee paid to the Chairman for all Board duties is set by the 
Remuneration Committee and the basic and additional fees paid  
to the other Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board.
The fees are reviewed (though not necessarily changed) annually 
having regard to independent advice and published surveys. The review 
takes account of fees paid for similar positions in the market, the time 
commitment required from the Director (estimated to be 60 days per 
year for the Chairman and 20 days per year as a basic requirement for 
other Non-Executive Directors) and any additional responsibilities and 
time commitments required in chairing various Board Committees or 
acting as the Senior Independent Director.
A travel allowance is also paid to Non-Executive Directors for 
attendance at Board meetings or other Board related matters  
held outside their continent of residence.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension  
entitlements or bonuses and may not participate in long-term  
incentive arrangements.
The Committee’s policy is 
to set fees at an appropriate 
level taking into account the 
factors outlined in this table.
5.2. Appointments
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors are not employed and do not have service agreements with the Company; they are  
also not entitled to participate in the Group’s pension, annual bonus or long-term incentive arrangements. Instead, they are appointed under 
individual Letters of Appointment and only receive a fee for their services. On appointment, the fee arrangements for a new Non-Executive 
Director will be determined in accordance with the policy in force at that time.
The Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for an initial three-year term but with an expectancy that they will serve for at least two 
three-year terms. That said, in accordance with the requirements of the Code, they (and the Executive Directors) are required to stand for 
election or re-election by shareholders at each AGM and their appointment can be terminated at any time without compensation by either  
party usually by either party serving not less than one month’s prior written notice.
The Letters of Appointment for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, together with the Service Agreements for the Executive 
Directors, are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. Their dates of appointment and current notice periods are shown  
in the table below.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 85
This Annual Report on Remuneration describes how the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, 
was applied in the financial year to 31 December 2017, and how it will be applied in the financial year commenced 1 January 2018. The relevant 
sections of this report have been audited, as required by the Regulations. 
1. Remuneration background relating to Executive Director changes during the year
(a) Chris Davies: appointment as Group Finance Director
Chris Davies joined the Company on 2 May, was appointed an Executive Director on 10 May and became Group Finance Director in 
succession to Matt Ashley (see below) on 1 June 2017. His remuneration package on appointment was the same as his predecessor and  
his Service Agreement is in line with the Company’s standard form at this level, including a 12-month notice period from the Company.
Mr Davies received his first full annual LTIP award on appointment with the same three-year performance conditions and scheduled vesting 
date of 2020 as applied to the annual LTIP awards made to the other Executive Directors on 18 April 2017. At the same time, he also received 
two Recruitment Incentive Awards (‘RIAs’) under the LTIP in recognition of certain incentives he forfeited on leaving his previous employer to 
join the Company. The RIAs are scheduled to vest on the first and second anniversary of grant subject to the same performance conditions  
as apply to the LTIP awards granted to the Executives in 2015 and 2016 (which are also scheduled to vest in 2018 and 2019) respectively.
(b) Matt Ashley: appointment as President and CEO, North America
As part of a career development opportunity for him and a strengthening of the executive team for the Company, Matt Ashley relinquished  
his role as Group Finance Director (but retained his executive directorship) on 31 May. This was to take up a two-year (minimum) assignment  
as President and CEO, North America, based in Chicago, commencing 1 September 2017.
In order for Mr Ashley to commence his new role (the transition for which started on 1 June), and for his family to join him in Chicago, the 
Company provided him with a relocation assistance package in line with normal practice for an international relocation at executive level.  
The package, which includes tax equalisation and exchange rate protection, falls into the following four main categories:
 – pre-visit costs for school and accommodation search purposes;
 – relocation costs related to storage, shipping, incidental expenditure and legal, professional and visa processing fees;
 – ongoing costs, including a 10% of salary disturbance allowance (to reflect the economic cost to his family of the relocation),  
occasional return flights to the UK, school fees, rented unfurnished accommodation, company car, medical and travel insurance,  
and tax return preparation assistance; and
 – return costs associated with shipping and return flights to the UK.
As Mr Ashley is liable to tax on these deemed relocation benefits, the amount paid to him in the year (substantially in the US), as set out in this 
report under ‘Relocation benefits’, is the total grossed-up cost of tax amount estimated to paid by the Company (except in relation to the 
disturbance allowance) on his behalf. In 2017, this amounted to £295,854.
Specific details confirming the above elements of remuneration are provided in this report. Further ongoing relocation cost details for Mr Ashley 
will be disclosed in next year’s report.

 As explained in 1(a) above, Chris Davies joined the Company on 2 May and was appointed a Director on 10 May 2017. His remuneration is shown pro rata to his period  
of service during the year.
2
 Matt Ashley relinquished his position as Group Finance Director (but not his executive directorship) on 1 June to take up his new role as President and CEO, North America, 
based in Chicago, effective from 1 September 2017. 
3
 Taxable benefits comprise a car allowance, private medical insurance and death in service and life assurance cover.
4
 The annual bonus represents the gross bonus declared and to be paid in March 2018 in connection with performance achieved in the year. As explained on page 88,  
part of this bonus will be paid in cash and part will be deferred for one year in the form of forfeitable shares in the Company.
5
 The LTIP represents the estimated value of shares that are scheduled to vest in March and/or May 2018 arising from a five-year legacy award made to Dean Finch in 2013, 
a three-year award made to Messrs. Finch and Ashley in 2015 and a one-year Recruitment Incentive Award made to Chris Davies in 2017. All such awards were based on  
a 31 December 2017 performance period end and their values have been calculated using a share price of 363.9p (being the three-month average to 31 December 2017). 
For Messrs. Finch and Ashley, the value also includes, in relation to their 2015 awards only, the dividend equivalent of 27.87p per share earned on the vested shares during 
the vesting period to be paid to them in cash on vesting. The actual values of vested shares (including the cash equivalent dividends received) will be confirmed in next 
year’s report. 
6
 As explained in section 1(b) above, Matt Ashley was given an international relocation package to assist him and his family with their move to Chicago. As Mr Ashley is liable 
to tax on these deemed relocation benefits, the amount paid to him in the year is the total grossed-up cost of tax amount estimated to paid by the Company (except in 
relation to the disturbance allowance) on his behalf. Additionally, in respect of the relocation benefits paid to him in the US during the year, the total amount shown includes 
the converted value of such benefits based on an exchange rate of $1.2888:£1, being the average rate for 2017.

 Since last year’s LTIP values of vested shares were estimated the 2016 LTIPs vested and total comparative figures for each of Messrs. Finch and Ashley have been  
adjusted to reflect actual values on vesting. For Dean Finch, 440,095 shares vested on 9 April 2017 when the closing share price was 360.3p and 130,703 shares  
vested on 3 August 2017 when the closing share price was 366.7p. For Matt Ashley, 149,372 shares vested on 9 April 2017 when the closing share price was 360.3p.
(a) Base salary
As explained in the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration, the base salaries set by the Committee for 2017 were £615,000 for Dean Finch and 
£350,000 for Matt Ashley. There was no change to Mr Ashley’s base salary (or any other parts of his remuneration or Service Agreement with 
the Company) when he relinquished his role (but not his executive directorship) on 31 May to take up the position as President and CEO,  
North America, based in Chicago, on 1 September 2017 (see 1.(b) above).
Chris Davies joined the Company on 2 May and was appointed to the Board on 10 May. He took up the role of Group Finance Director, in 
succession to Mr Ashley, on 1 June 2017. His base salary (and other elements of remuneration) for 2017 was set at the same level as his 
predecessor, ie £350,000 pa (see 1.(a) above). 
(b) Pensions
The Executive Directors are not entitled to participate in the Group’s pension schemes. Instead, they receive a pension allowance (gross)  
which does not qualify as salary or for any other benefit or entitlement. The Group Chief Executive currently receives an allowance of 35%  
of salary and each of the other Executive Directors receives an allowance of 25% of salary. Under the proposed the new policy, the Group  
Chief Executive’s pension allowance will be reduced from 35% to 30% of salary in three equal tranches commencing in 2019 (see page 76). 
Benefits under the Group Chief Executive’s previous unfunded pension arrangement ceased to accrue with effect from 5 June 2016  
(see note 9 on page 96]).

(c) Annual bonus
A summary of the 2017 performance-related bonus plan for the Executive Directors is set out below.
 – Group Chief Executive:
 – Maximum opportunity  – 200% of salary
 – Target weighting   – 75% financial 
– 25% non-financial (including 18% safety related)
 – Deferred element   – 25% of bonus earned up to 125% of salary 
– 50% of bonus earned between 125% – 150% of salary 
– 75% of bonus earned between 150% – 200% of salary
 – Other Executive Directors:
 – Maximum opportunity  – 150% of salary
 – Target weighting   – 75% financial 
– 25% non-financial (including 18% safety related)
 – Deferred element   – 25% of bonus earned up to 125% of salary 
– 50% of bonus earned between 125% – 150% of salary
The Committee has full discretion in the payment of annual bonuses. It is a pre-condition to the award of any bonus that the Committee has 
determined that there has been an improvement in the Group’s safety processes, procedures and outcomes during the year. In respect of the 
latter, the Committee consulted with the Chair of the Safety & Environment Committee, and satisfied itself that based on: (i) the level of due 
diligence undertaken by that Committee, and (ii) the evidence made available in support of the Group’s safety performance against the basket 
of measures we consistently compare ourselves against, 2017 had been another year in which the Group’s performance had shown year-on-
year improvement in its safety processes, procedures and outcomes. For any financial element of the bonus to be payable, the Group must 
have achieved at least the threshold level of normalised profit target for the year.
The Committee has reviewed performance against the financial and non-financial targets attached to the 2017 bonus plan and, in addition, 
made an assessment of the Group’s overall performance in 2017.

 The original normalised PBT Target was set at £180.1m. This was adjusted to £176.6m to reflect foreign exchange rate movements, the exit from UK rail and growth capital 
profit. The Maximum and Threshold levels have also been adjusted to reflect their original +/– 10% linkage to Target.

 The original free cash flow target was £117.1m. This was adjusted to £115.0m to reflect foreign exchange rate movements and growth capital profit. The Maximum and 
Threshold levels have also been adjusted to reflect their original +/– 10% linkage to Target.

 Details of the non-financial bonus targets, and the corresponding performance outturns for each of the Executive Directors, is set out below.
The cash bonus will be paid, and the deferred bonus award granted (in the form of forfeitable shares in the Company under the rules of the 
Executive Deferred Bonus Plan (‘EDBP’)), in March 2018. The forfeitable shares:
 – will be calculated based on the Company’s average share price for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant;
 – will be held in the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust where the beneficial interest is held by, and dividends arising on them are paid to,  
the Executive Director;
 – will vest on the first anniversary of grant, subject to continued service or, in the absence of the same, good leaver status being confirmed under 
the EDBP; and
 – are subject to malus and clawback for a two-year period from the date of grant.

Summary of non-financial bonus targets and corresponding performance outturns for 2017
As Matt Ashley and Chris Davies were new to their roles in 2017, all three Executive Directors (Dean Finch, Matt Ashley and Chris Davies) have  
been judged against the below common set of objectives which in total represented a 25% target weighting of the annual bonus opportunity 
for each person.
Objective Performance
Safety (10% of 25%)
Deliver a year-on-year 
improvement in the 
Fatalities and Weighted  
Injuries Index (‘FWI’).
Safety, as measured by the FWI, improved materially from 17.085 in 2016 (or 10.585 excluding Chattanooga) to a record low of 8.574. 
Both UK bus and UK coach have again been awarded the BSC Safety Sword of Honour and each retained 5-star British Safety 
Council ratings – UK bus with a score of 97.4, the highest in the industry for the year. North America regained its ‘satisfactory’ 
Department of Transportation (‘DOT’) safety rating – the highest rating awarded by the DOT.
Safety systems and  
processes (8% of 25%)
 – Progress with the 
implementation of a 
single system in each 
business to capture 
 all complaints and 
comments relating  
to drivers
 – Continue the roll-out 
of DriveCam CCTV 
and Master Driver
 – Improve Driver 
Performance 
management  
systems, including  
the competence of  
driver managers
 – Improve the 
assessment, 
monitoring and 
coaching of drivers
 – Improve the 
management  
of speeding
 – Progress the 
implementation  
of world class 
maintenance.
The Group-wide Customer Feedback Management System is being supplied by iCaseworks. The target completion date for full 
Group implementation is June 2018. In North America, the system is now live and available to all student transportation CSCs.  
ALSA is also well progressed and German Rail implementation is planned for April 2018. The UK will be completed in June 2018. 
In all Divisions, work has been done to enable the system to be implemented on schedule.
DriveCam is on target. 6,351 units have been installed in North America, and the full fleet is fitted in the UK. In Spain, data protection 
issues required our supplier to set up a centre in Europe which was done in November - 152 units are now fitted and working. 
Bahrain and Morocco are fully fitted with CCTV. All progress is consistent with the 2020 plan.
Master Driver - we now have 698 Master Drivers of which UK bus has 338, UK coach 73 (partner operators start in 2018) and ALSA 
287. North America has commenced a pilot of the programme. Bahrain is finalising the external verifier in Q1 2018 now that the 
drivers have the required length of service to qualify for the programme. 
Competency of Driver Managers - on target for the 2020 plan. The North America pilot starts in January 2018; UK pilots took place in 
Autumn 2017 and training for all trainers started in January 2018; Spain and Morocco training started in Autumn 2017 and continues 
into Q1 2018; Bahrain training commences in Q1 2018.
Driver Performance Management - largely on target and at the early stage of implementation. Each of the Divisions is implementing 
this policy at a different pace as it is dependent on the electronic collation of data on the drivers. Electronic database of drivers has 
been put in place in ALSA, Bahrain and North America; risk profiling has been developed and is being trialled in the UK, ALSA and 
Bahrain.
Our proposed driver evaluation system was checked by the University of Oviedo in Spain which, at the end of June 2017, said ‘the 
test is excellent with a high reliability coefficient’. It was only with this test validation that roll-out could start. This initiative is currently 
on target: North America will be piloted in Q1 2018; UK started in January 2018 and Spain and Morocco in October and November 
2017 respectively; Bahrain trialled in December 2017. 
All Divisions have implemented monitoring of speed. There have been challenges with the technology which have had to be worked 
through. Significant progress has been made in all Divisions in reducing incidents of speeding.
With the appointment of Miguel Alonso as Group Engineering Director, progress has been made on all seven elements that make up 
World Class Maintenance (ie Vehicle Maintenance, Specifications, Process, Supplier Relationships, People, Facilities and Equipment 
and Assurance). Of the 10 Global Maintenance Standards identified, seven have been issued and three are in draft.
Business development  
(7% of 25%)
 – Sell c2c, the UK  
rail franchise
 – Continue to develop 
the M&A strategy
 – Continue to develop 
the international 
diversification strategy, 
including building the 
talents of the team
 – Continue to develop 
the digital strategy
 – Promote the 
development of  
the Operational 
Excellence initiative.
The c2c UK rail franchise was successfully sold in February 2017 – delivering a significant cash benefit to the Group and removing  
a future risk. Subsequent developments in the UK rail industry have supported the long-term strategic value of this divestment.
We conducted a comprehensive and objective review of the potential returns in both existing and new markets in order to balance 
risk and reward when investing Group capital. Market entry strategies outside of core markets were also analysed. 
We continued our successful bolt-on M&A activity in North America and ALSA again this year with nine deals completed. 
During 2017, we made two senior hires to lead the international team. The team performed a review of global market attractiveness 
with deep dives into potential markets, and worked in tandem with ALSA on two significant bids. A comprehensive pipeline of 
opportunities is being developed.
After an extensive search, the Group has hired a new Chief Digital Officer (‘CDO’) to develop and lead our digital strategy. Working 
with the Group Commercial Director, the CDO is focusing on areas where digital can drive revenues or reduce costs. The team 
continues to evaluate and respond to threats created by digital disruptors, and is also looking at opportunities to use digital to build 
on our core strengths.
During 2017, two international Operational Excellence project teams were formed and they conducted studies into driver recruiting, 
training, and manpower utilisation. The 11 participants on the programme were drawn from our graduate programme and other high 
potentials. Two project teams will again be run in 2018 and the first project commenced in January.
Based on the above assessment against the objectives set, the Committee determined that for the non-financial elements of their respective 
bonuses, the performance of Dean Finch warranted a 40% pay out of a 50% of salary maximum opportunity, and each of Matt Ashley and 
Chris Davies warranted a 30% pay out of a 37.5% of salary maximum opportunity.

 – the Board determined that the Non-Executive Directors’ base fee would increase by 5% to £51,500 pa and the fee for the Senior 
Independent Director would increase by 5% to £7,500 pa in order to ensure they reflect the role, responsibilities and market rate

4. Statement of Directors’ shareholdings
Executive Directors’ interests and share ownership guidelines
In order to align the interests of the Executive Directors more closely with those of shareholders, the Executive Directors are encouraged to 
build up a shareholding in the Company over a five-year period from 2015, or their respective date of appointment if later, as set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy on page 79. The shareholding target for the Group Chief Executive is shares to the value of 200% of salary  
and for the other Executive Directors is 150% of salary.
The beneficial and non-beneficial interests of the Executive Directors and their connected persons, and details of their outstanding LTIP 
interests, as at 31 December 2017 are shown below.

6. Comparison of overall performance
The two graphs below show a comparison of the Company’s cumulative total shareholder return (ie share price growth plus dividends paid) 
and annual return against the FTSE 250 Index and a Bespoke Index (comprising peer group companies) over a 9-year and a 3-year period. The 
FTSE 250 Index has been selected as the Company is a constituent of that Index and it is therefore considered to be the most appropriate 
benchmark for comparative purposes.

The Group achieved a very strong performance in 2017 with revenue, profits and free cash flow up significantly on 2016, beating the budgeted 
profit before tax (as adjusted) by 13.3%. This excellent result, underpinned by a strong and sustainable free cash flow, has merited the 10% 
increase in the full year dividend for the second year in a row.
In 2017, our vehicles travelled 1.1 billion kilometres. We also carried a record 882 million passengers (on a continuing operations basis), up 1.2% in 
the year, reflecting the strong focus in all our businesses on good service and value for money. There was strong growth in both of our international 
divisions, with North America revenue and operating profit up 10.1% and 6.8% respectively on a constant currency basis. ALSA delivered revenue 
growth of 3.6% and a profit increase of 4.4%, again on a constant currency basis. The newly combined UK Division, comprising bus and coach, 
delivered a very impressive second half performance (reversing a first half decline) resulting in revenue growth of 0.6% and profit growth of 5.3%. 
German Rail delivered big increases in constant currency revenue (20.4%) and profit. The Group completed nine acquisitions in the year: three in 
North America, including Cook DuPage Transportation which provided us with entry into the US’s largest para-transit market (Chicago), and six  
in ALSA, including three that build on our successful Swiss ski market entry and strengthen our presence in Geneva. 
Altogether, 2017 was another sector leading financial performance.

7. The context of pay in the National Express Group
The following table sets out the change in certain elements of the remuneration paid to the Group Chief Executive from 2016 to 2017 compared 
with the average percentage change for the UK employee population.
The Group Chief Executive’s remuneration, disclosed in the table below, has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits 
and annual bonus (including any amount deferred) on the basis used for determining the single figure. The UK employee remuneration is based 
on the base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus of those UK employees who received taxable benefits and bonuses. The Group uses 
the UK workforce as an appropriate comparator group for the average employee as this avoids complicated exchange rate adjustments that 
would have to be used if we included employees in the Group’s overseas operations in the calculation.

9. Statement of implementation of current Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2018
(a) Executive Directors’ base salaries
The Committee determined that the base salary for the Group Chief Executive and each of the Executive Directors would be increased by 2.5% 
with effect from 1 January 2018, broadly in line with the UK general workforce increase. In doing so, the Committee recognised the excellent 
financial and operating performance delivered by Dean Finch, supported by his executive team, in 2017. This has resulted in significant 
shareholder value and a strong platform from which to build further growth in line with the Board’s challenging strategy.
Accordingly, the annual base salaries of the Executive Directors in 2018 are:
Executive Director
Base salary
(gross)
Dean Finch, Group Chief Executive £630,375
Chris Davies, Group Finance Director £358,750
Matt Ashley, President and CEO, North America £358,750
(b) Pensions
The Group Chief Executive will continue to receive a 35% of salary pension allowance and each of the other Executive Directors a 25% of salary 
pension allowance.
(c) Annual bonus
The annual bonus for the 2018 financial year will be structured and operate for Dean Finch and Chris Davies on the same basis as the 
arrangements in place during 2017 (as set out on page 87). However, for Matt Ashley, his financial bonus targets will be weighted as to 75% 
North America EBIT and 25% Group PBT and his non-financial bonus targets, including safety, will be wholly North American focused.
When setting the bonus targets for 2018, the Committee has taken into account:
 – the Board’s challenging three-year strategy to 2020 and the first-year expectations within that
 – the Group’s approved budget and operating plan for 2018
 – stock market consensus for 2018
 – the non-recurring items included in the 2017 results which will need replacing in 2018
 – increased pricing pressures and competition in the UK and North America generally.
Targets will be set on a basis consistent with accounting measures (ie without reference to exceptional items).
Corporate Governance Report Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 97
The Committee will set calibrated targets for the bonus measures and intends to disclose actual performance against these in next year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. As a matter of commercial sensitivity, the Committee has decided not to disclose bonus performance targets 
in advance although 18% (2017: 18%) of the 25% non-financial bonus element will be based on safety objectives.
In anticipation of and subject to the approval of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy to be put before shareholders at the AGM in May,  
it is proposed that the revised safety underpin to the annual bonus plan for the Executive Directors (as set out on page 77) will apply for 2018.
(d) Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) awards
LTIP awards in 2018 are proposed to be granted in line with the normal annual award levels contained in the current Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy. Accordingly, awards with attaching performance conditions will be made to the value of 200% of salary to the Group Chief Executive 
and 150% of salary to the other Executive Directors.
The performance condition metrics, weightings and vesting levels for the 2018 awards will be as follows:
Performance condition Weighting
Threshold
(25% vesting EPS and TSR,
0% vesting ROCE)
Target
(50% vesting)
Maximum
(100% vesting)
TSR vs. FTSE 250 Index 1/6 Median – Upper Quintile
TSR vs. Bespoke Index

1/6 Equal to Index – ≥ Index + 10% pa
EPS 1/3 31.5p 33.3p 36.3
ROCE 1/3 9% 10% 12%
1
 Comprising three comparator companies, namely: FirstGroup plc, Stagecoach Group plc and Go-Ahead Group plc.
Performance for each element will be measured over the three-year financial period ending 31 December 2020 and awards will be subject  
to a two-year holding period post vesting and malus and clawback for two years from the date of vesting, including post cessation of 
employment. Dividend equivalent entitlements will attach to any vested shares over the vesting period and during the holding period  
while the option remains unexercised.
For TSR measures, straight-line vesting will occur between Threshold and Maximum levels of performance. For EPS and ROCE measures, 
straight-line vesting will occur between Threshold and Target, and Target and Maximum levels of performance.
10. Non-Executive Directors’ fees
With effect from 1 January 2018, and to ensure that the annual fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors reflect the current roles, 
responsibilities and market rates for the positions held, the Committee and, in the case of other Non-Executive Directors, the Board  
has determined that:
 – the Chairman’s fee (including as Chair of the Nominations Committee) would be increased by £6,000 pa
 – the Non-Executive Directors’ base fee would be increased by £1,300 pa
 – the Board Committee Chair fees would be increased by £1,000 pa
 – the Senior Independent Director’s fee would be increased by £1,000 pa.
Accordingly, the annual fees of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors in 2018 are:
Role
Fees
(gross)
Chairman £246,000
Non-Executive Director (base fee) £52,800
Chair of Board Committee (excluding Nominations) £11,000
Senior Independent Director £8,500
In addition, a travel allowance of £4,000 will continue to be payable to Joaquín Ayuso, Chris Muntwyler and Lee Sander as overseas based 
Directors in respect of each Board meeting or other Board related matters they attend outside their continent of residence.

12. Retained advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee received remuneration and ancillary legal and governance advice from PwC, its external remuneration 
consultants. Apart from some input received on benchmarking roles below Board level for pay review purposes, and advice received in  
relation to tax, internal audit support and deal delivery, PwC has no other connection with the Group. PwC has voluntarily signed up to  
the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives from PwC is objective  
and independent. For the financial year under review, PwC received fees of £139,250 in connection with its work for the Committee.
13. Dilution
The Company has permitted new share dilution authorities reserved to it under the rules of its 2015 LTIP as previously approved by 
shareholders, which are in line with the Investment Association’s guidelines. However, given that the Company’s funding strategy has been  
and continues to be to satisfy all outstanding share awards granted under that plan (and its other incentive plans) through the delivery of  
market purchased shares held in the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust, as opposed to the issue and allotment of new shares, the Company 
has not to date used up any of its dilution authority under the 2015 LTIP.

Corporate Governance Report Relations with Shareholders
Investor engagement 
The Board is committed to maintaining an open dialogue with the 
Company’s equity institutional and debt investors and individual 
shareholders, and recognises the importance of those relationships in 
the governance process. This engagement allows the Board to better 
understand their views and ensure they are provided with timely and 
appropriate information on the Group’s strategy, performance, 
objectives, financing and other key developments. 
The Chairman, supported by the Executive Directors and the investor 
relations team, has overall responsibility for ensuring effective 
communication with shareholders. 
The investor relations section of the Company’s website,  
www.nationalexpressgroup.com/investors, includes all RNS 
announcements, share price information, annual and interim 
documents, AGM Notice and other similar corporate communication 
and shareholder materials available for download. 
Institutional investors
The Company operates a comprehensive engagement programme, 
aligned to its financial reporting calendar and other key events, for 
institutional investors and research analysts, providing the opportunity 
for current and potential investors to meet with executive and 
operational management. 
The Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
held a number of meetings with existing and prospective institutional 
shareholders during the year and gave presentations to them 
following the full year and half year results. These are designed to 
provide more information on the Group’s strategy, financial and 
operational performance, strengths and capabilities and future plans. 
They have also met and given presentations to research analysts and 
investment banks’ sales teams. 
The Senior Independent Director and other Non-Executive Directors 
have made themselves available for meetings should that be 
requested by shareholders. 
There were 13 analysts who published equity research notes covering 
the Company during the year. Details of the firms who currently follow 
the Company appear on the investor section of our website. It is 
anticipated that with the introduction of MiFID II, analyst coverage  
will reduce going forward.
The Company’s brokers and investor relations advisers provide 
regular confidential feedback on investor views, perceptions and 
opinions and these are shared with the Board. During the year, the 
Board also received external analysis and positive feedback from 
advisers on shareholder and market perception of the Group’s 
performance and strategy. 
Details of the Company’s substantial shareholders are set in the 
Directors’ Report on page 103.

Directors
The names and biographical details of the current Directors (all of 
whom held office throughout the year except for Chris Davies – see 
below), and the Board Committees of which they are members, are 
set out on page 48.
Chris Davies was appointed to the Board as an Executive Director on 
10 May and as Group Finance Director on 1 June 2017. He replaced 
Matt Ashley who relinquished that position (but not his executive 
directorship) on 30 May to take up a new role as President and  
CEO, North America, effective from 1 September 2017.
The Service Agreements of the Executive Directors and the Letters 
of Appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office. Brief details of  
these, including inspection rights, are included in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 68.
Powers of the Directors
The Board manages the business of the Company under the powers 
set out in the Companies Articles of Association (‘Articles’). These 
powers include the Directors’ ability to issue or buy back shares. 
Shareholders’ authority to empower the Directors to make certain 
market purchases of its own ordinary shares is sought at the AGM 
each year (see below). The Articles can only be amended, or new 
Articles adopted, by a resolution passed by shareholders in general 
meeting by at least three quarters of the votes cast.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The rules for the appointment and replacement of Directors are set 
out in the Articles, the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’), the 
Act and related legislation. The Board may appoint a Director either to 
fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the Board so long as the total 
number of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the 
Articles. An appointed Director must retire and seek election to office 
at the next AGM of the Company. In addition to any power of removal 
conferred by the Act, the Company may by ordinary resolution 
remove any Director before the expiry of their period of office and 
may, subject to the Articles, by ordinary resolution appoint another 
person who is willing to act as a Director in their place.
In accordance with the Code and the Board’s policy, all the Directors 
will retire at the forthcoming AGM and have offered themselves for 
re-election, with the exception of Chris Davies who, having been 
appointed to office since the last AGM, will stand for election.  
The Board is satisfied that each of the Directors standing is qualified 
by virtue of their skills, experience and contribution to the Board.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Board operates a policy to identify and manage declared actual 
and potential conflicts of interest which Directors (or their connected 
persons) may have and are obliged to avoid under their statutory 
duties and the Company’s Articles of Association. The Board 
considers each Director’s situation and decides whether to approve 
any conflicts based on the overriding principle that a Director must at 
all times only be able to consider and exercise judgement to promote 
the success of the Company. The policy has been in place and 
operated effectively throughout the year. Authorisations given by the 
Board are reviewed on a regular basis.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 102 Directors’ Report Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company has granted indemnities to each Director in respect  
of any liabilities incurred in relation to acts or omissions arising in the 
ordinary course of their duties, but only to the extent permitted by 
law. The Company also maintains appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance in respect of potential legal action instigated against 
its Directors.
Directors’ interests
Save as disclosed:
 – in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, none of the Directors, nor 
any person connected with them, has any interest in the share or 
loan capital of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and
 – in note 36 to the consolidated accounts on page 175, none of  
the Directors had at any time during the year ended 31 December 
2017 a material interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract of 
significance with the Company or any subsidiary undertaking (other 
than the Executive Directors in relation to their Service Agreements).
Equal opportunities
National Express is an equal opportunities employer and has in  
place an Equal Opportunities Policy. Our range of employment 
policies and guidelines reflect the legal and employment requirements 
of the territories in which we operate and safeguard the interests of 
employees, potential employees and other workers. We do not 
condone unfair treatment of any kind and offer equal opportunities  
in all aspects of employment and advancement (including recruitment, 
training, career development and promotion) regardless of race, 
nationality, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, 
religious or political beliefs. The Company recognises it has clear 
obligations to give fair consideration and selection to disabled 
applicants and to satisfy their training and development needs during 
employment. Where an employee becomes disabled, the objective is 
to retain their services wherever possible.
Employee engagement
The Group encourages employee involvement in its affairs. Subsidiary 
companies produce a range of internal newsletters and circulars 
which keep employees abreast of developments. Senior management 
within the Group meet regularly to review strategic developments and 
management conferences are held at Group and business levels to 
bring senior managers together to share ideas and develop policy. 
Members of the Senior Management Group are also visible within the 
businesses and undertake a range of visits where they meet face to 
face with employees to gather feedback on safety and other issues. 
Dialogue takes place regularly with trade unions and other employee 
representatives on a wide range of issues.
Employee views are also sought through regular employee 
satisfaction surveys, both within business units and across the  
Group. Following such surveys, results are shared with employees 
and action plans put in place to deal with issues arising. The Group 
encourages innovation from all levels of employees and has a 
structured programme to encourage and reward suggestions and 
employees’ contributions.
Information regarding the Company’s safeguarding of human rights  
is set out on pages 30 and 32.
Political contributions
It is the Group’s policy not to make political donations and none were 
made in the year (2016: nil). However, the Company did attend party 
political conferences during the year for which total expenditure was  
£12,000 (2016: £14,000).

for an aggregate consideration of £6.24m (including dealing costs) 
and released 2,316,546 shares to satisfy vested share plan awards.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 103 Directors’ Report Directors’ Report continued
As at 31 December 2017, the EBT held 1,643,746 National Express 
Group PLC shares (0.32% of the issued share capital) in trust.  
The Trustee may vote the shares it holds at its discretion. A dividend 
waiver is in place from the Trustee in respect of dividends payable  
by the Company on the majority of the shares held in the EBT.
Further details regarding the EBT, and of shares issued during  
the year pursuant to the Company’s various share incentive plans 
(whose rules, where relevant, reflect the current Investment 
Association guidelines for permitted dilution limits), are set out  
in note 32 to the financial statements on page 165.
Shareholder voting rights and restrictions 
on transfer of shares
Shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at any general meeting, 
where every member has one vote on a show of hands and one vote 
for each share held on a poll.
There are no special control rights attaching to the Company’s 
ordinary shares save that the control rights over ordinary shares held 
in the EBT can be directed by the Company to satisfy the vesting of 
outstanding awards under its various share incentive plans.
The Company is not aware of any agreements or control rights 
between existing shareholders that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or voting rights. The rights, including full details 
relating to voting of shareholders and any restrictions on transfer 
relating to the Company’s ordinary shares, are set out in the Articles 
and in the explanatory notes to the Notice of 2018 AGM which 
accompanies this document. Resolutions will be proposed at the 
2018 AGM to authorise the Directors to exercise all powers to allot 
shares, or grant rights for, or to convert any security into shares,  
and approve a limited disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights. 
Change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid.
Under the terms of the Company’s revolving credit facilities, upon a 
change of control, the Company would have five days to enter into 
negotiations with the lenders to alter the terms. Following ten days  
of negotiations, if no agreement has been reached, outstanding 
balances may become repayable.
Under the terms of the £1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note 
Programme (as updated on 3 October 2017) under which the 
Company issued Medium Term Notes (‘MTN’) to various institutions 
on 15 June 2010, 11 November 2016 and 13 November 2017, there  
is a change of control put option such that, upon a change of control 
event, any holder of any MTN may require the Company to redeem  
or purchase that MTN.
The Company entered into a private placement Note Purchase 
Agreement on 30 July 2012 relating to the issue by the Company of 
€78,500,000 4.55% Senior Notes due 16 August 2021. Under the 
terms of the Agreement the Company is required to offer to Note 
holders to repay to them the entire unpaid principal amount and 
interest thereon upon a change of control.
The Group’s UK Bus business operates the Midland Metro tram 
service and the UK Bus operating subsidiary is party to a contract 
with Transport for West Midlands (‘TfWM’), formerly known as Centro, 
governing certain aspects of such operation. The contract with TfWm 
contains an event of default on a change in control of  
the UK operating subsidiary (which would be triggered on a change  
in control of the Company) if such change in control is not approved 
by TfWM.
The Group’s UK Coach business operates a number of coach and 
bus services from or at certain UK airports and the UK Coach 
operating subsidiary is also contracted to provide passenger 
transport services for certain other third parties. A number of these 
contracts contain rights for the counterparties to terminate them on  
a change of control of the relevant subsidiary company party to such 
contracts (certain of which would be triggered by a change in control 
of the Company).
The Company’s various share incentive plans contain provisions that 
take effect on a change in control of the Company but do not entitle 
participants to a greater interest in the shares of the Company than 
created by the initial grant or award under the relevant plan.
While no one of these contracts is considered significant in the 
context of the Group’s business as a whole, the impact on the Group 
if all such contracts were terminated could be significant.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors  
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment or otherwise that occurs specifically because of  
a takeover.
Auditor and disclosure of information  
to the auditor
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information that has not been brought to the attention of the 
Company’s auditor. Each Director has taken all reasonable steps  
to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information  
and to establish that such information was provided to the auditor.
As recommended by the Audit Committee and endorsed by the 
Board, a resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditor of the 
Company will be proposed at the 2018 AGM. 
2018 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)
This year’s AGM will be held at 2.00pm on Wednesday, 16 May 2018 
in The Horton Suite at the Macdonald Burlington Hotel, Burlington 
Arcade, 126 New Street, Birmingham, B2 4JQ. A separate circular, 
comprising a letter from the Chairman, Notice of Meeting and 
explanatory notes on the resolutions proposed, accompanies this 
Annual Report. Copies of this document can also be found on the 
Company’s website at www.nationalexpressgroup.com.
The Directors’ Report was approved by the Board on 1 March 2018.
By order of the Board
Michael Arnaouti
Group Company Secretary
National Express Group PLC 
Company No. 2590560
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 104 Directors’ Report Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors are required  
to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), as adopted  
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation, and  
have elected to prepare the parent Company Financial Statements  
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), 
including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. Under company 
law, the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 – make judgement and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements; and
 – prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events  
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure  
that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the  
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation  
taken as a whole;
 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
 – the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole,  
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors 
on 1 March 2018 and is signed on its behalf by:

Opinion on financial statements of National Express Group PLC
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017  
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union;
 – the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
 – the Group Income Statement;
 – the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income;
 – the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets;
 – the Group Statement of Cash Flows;
 – the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity; 
 – the related notes 1 to 39 for the Group financial statements; and
 – the related notes 1 to 19 for the Parent Company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
 – Goodwill and fixed asset impairment;
 – North American insurance and other claims provisions;
In the prior year we identified pensions and fuel hedge accounting as key audit matters. These have not been 
identified as key audit matters in the current year due to the low history of misstatement and a reduction in the 
complexity and risk in these balances during the current year.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements in the current year was £10.0 million which 
was determined on the basis of normalised profit before tax. 
Materiality represents 5.0% of this profit metric (2016: 5.1%).
Scoping – Full scope audit work was completed on a divisional sub-consolidation basis for UK, North America and 
Spain (including Morocco). 
 – Full scope audit procedures have been performed on the Parent Company financial statements.
 – All other parts of the Group have been subject to analytical review procedures.
The four operating divisions and the Group head office function contributed 100% (2016: 100%) of Group 
revenue and Group operating profit and 99% (2016: 99%) of Group net assets.
The group is organised into four operating divisions, each of which has its own sub-consolidation, plus the 
head office function. Audit work for these components was completed to levels of materiality between £3.2 
million and £7.2 million. The components account for 100% of Group revenue and operating profit and 99%  
of group assets.
Financial Statements 106 Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern 
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 41 about whether they considered  
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them  
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s  
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement 
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
 
We confirm that we have nothing material to 
report, add or draw attention to in respect  
of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement 
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were 
consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the 
knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and 
the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether 
we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 – the disclosures on pages 38 to 40 that describe the principal risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
 – the directors’ confirmation on page 36 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
 – the directors’ explanation on page 41 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to 
be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects 
of the group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
 
We confirm that we have nothing material to 
report, add or draw attention to in respect  
of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements  
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we  
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Impairment of goodwill and other fixed assets
Key audit matter description Total goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2017 were £2,601.6 
million. The most significant balances relate to the Spain and Morocco division (£1,187.4 million) and the 
North America division (£1,174.4 million).
There is a risk surrounding the recoverability of these balances, as assessed annually by management  
as part of their impairment review, using discounted cash flows on a value in use basis. 
The key judgements in assessing goodwill and other non-current assets for impairment are the discount 
rate, the perpetual growth rate used and more specifically ALSA’s cash flow impact due to the Spanish 
concession renewals. 
The value in use models are sensitive to changes in these rates, both of which must reflect a long-term 
view of underlying growth in each respective economy. We note that estimating a value in use is inherently 
judgemental, and a range of assumptions can reasonably be applied in determining an appropriate 
discount rate and perpetual growth rate to use.
In Spain the risk in relation to the Spanish concession renewals arises due to the potential pricing impact 
after the renewals and the subsequent margin recovery. The key judgements are around whether 
management will retain the concessions and what the margin will be if it does.
The Audit Committee Report on page 60 refers to goodwill and fixed asset impairment as a key judgement 
considered by the Audit Committee.
Note 2 to the financial statements sets out the Group’s accounting policy for testing goodwill for 
impairment. The basis for the impairment reviews is outlined in note 14 to the financial statements, 
including details of the pre-tax discount rate and terminal growth rate used. Note 14 to the financial 
statements also includes details of the extent to which the goodwill and fixed asset impairment test is 
sensitive to changes in the key inputs.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
Our procedures for challenging management’s methodology and assumptions focused on the Group’s 
interests in Spain (and Morocco) and North America and included:
 – validating the integrity of the impairment models through testing of the mechanical accuracy and 
verifying the application of the input assumptions;
 – understanding the underlying process used to determine the risk adjusted discount rates;
 – assessing the appropriateness of any changes to assumptions since the prior period;
 – challenging the cash flow forecasts with reference to historical forecasts, actual performance  
and independent evidence to support any significant expected future changes to the business; 
 – understanding and assessing the appropriateness of the key asumptions used in the Spanish 
concession renewals process and the expected margin impact in the Spanish division;
 – working with our valuation specialists to benchmark the discount rates and perpetuity growth rates 
applied to external macro-economic and market data. This involved consideration of the impact of 
territory-specific risk adjustments to the discount rate and perpetuity growth rates versus the risk 
adjustments made to the underlying cash flows; and
 – assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures included in the financial statements including the 
sensitivity analysis provided.
Key observations We determined that there is currently sufficient headroom for both the Spain and Morocco division and  
the North America division such that we concur with management that no impairment is required.   
We conclude that the assumptions applied in the impairment models, when taken in aggregate, are within 
our acceptable range.
Financial Statements 108 Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC North American insurance and other claims
Key audit matter description The company operates a transportation business and therefore requires third party insurance. The group 
operates two levels of insurance, a self-covering level and an outsourced level. Of the total Group claims 
provision of £114.1 million at 31 December 2017, £109.2 million relates to the North American division.  
This reflects historical claims being managed by the Group, as well as provision for new claims identified  
in the year, including amounts arising through acquisitions in the year that have required separate fair  
value consideration. 
Estimation of insurance and other claims provisions, including those arising on acquisition, is highly 
judgemental and is based on assessment of the expected settlement of known claims together with  
an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents incurred but not reported at the 
balance sheet date. 
The measurement of the self-insured claims provision in North America uses a combination of actuarial 
assumptions around loss development and management judgement to ensure that the Group is 
appropriately provided.
Given the level of complexity and judgement involved in making these estimations there is a risk of  
material misstatement, whether due to error or inappropriate management bias, and therefore the  
eventual outcome could be materially different from that estimated and provided for. 
The Audit Committee Report on page 60 refers to North American insurance and other claims provisions 
as a key judgement considered by the Audit Committee. This area has also been highlighted as a key 
accounting estimate and judgement in note 2 to the financial statements.
Details of the Group claims provision are given in note 26 to the financial statements.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We used our actuarial specialists to challenge the assumptions inherent in the valuation produced by the 
Group’s actuary in North America for the high-volume lower value claims, such as the loss development 
factors and ultimate expected losses, and to re-perform the actuarial calculation to develop a valuation 
range. Additionally we have assessed the expert’s competence and considered their independence and 
objectivity.
For the individually large claims not subject to actuarial review, we discussed the nature of each claim  
with the US general counsel and those responsible for claims handling and tested a sample of items  
to independent third party reports to assess the expected range of possible outcomes. This included 
testing the fair value of provisions recognised on acquisitions during the year.
We compared the overall level of provision recorded to the range determined by management and the 
Group’s actuary, to conclude whether the level of provision was appropriate. This involved consideration  
of the audit evidence supporting the range as well as the independent assessment of the range for 
higher-volume lower value claims produced by our actuarial specialists.
Key observations As part of our detailed audit work testing the various aspects of the provision, including new amounts 
recognised at fair value on acquisition and the income statement charge for the year, we did not identify 
any material exceptions. As a result we believe the balance sheet provision is materially in line with our 
expectations.

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality Group materiality as £10.0 million (2016: £8.9 million)
Parent company materiality as £7.4 million (2016: £6.8 million)
Basis for determining 
materiality
5.0% (2016: 5.3%) of normalised profit before tax. This materiality level equates to less than 1% of equity.
Normalised profit before tax is disclosed on the face of the Group income statement where it is reconciled 
to statutory profit before tax. Note 11 to the financial statements outlines profit before tax of £4.4 million  
for discontinued operations.
Parent company materiality was set at 74% of Group materiality and equates to 0.8% of the Company’s 
net assets.
Rationale for the benchmark 
applied
Normalised profit is a key performance measure for management, investors and the analyst community 
which facilitates the users’ understanding of the underlying trading performance.
Normalised results are defined as the statutory results excluding intangible amortisation for acquired 
businesses and profit for the year from discontinued operations and consequent UK restructuring.
Net assets is considered an appropriate benchmark for the parent Company given that it is mainly  
a holding Company.

as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Financial Statements 110 Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, as in the prior year, we focused our Group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at the four operating divisions and the Group head office function. Each operating division produces its own 
sub-consolidation and was subject to an audit that was scoped relevant to its component materiality level, which was between £3.2 million and 
£7.2 million for both the current and prior year. This audit work was principally performed by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited member firms, 
with a number of non Deloitte component auditors reporting to Deloitte Spain for the Spain and Morocco divisional audit. The Group head 
office work was performed to a component materiality level of £6.4 million, consistent with the prior year.
The four operating divisions and the Group head office function contributed 100% (2016: 100%) of Group revenue and Group operating profit 
and 99% (2015: 99%) of Group net assets.
Group-level analytical review procedures were performed over the amounts held in the Bahrain joint venture.
At the Parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor and/or  
a senior member of the audit team visits each of the three non-UK divisions where the Group audit scope was focused at least once a year  
in addition to the work performed at the Group head office. In relation to the current year audit the Senior Statutory Auditor and/or a senior 
member of the audit team visited Spain, North America and Germany at least once. Likewise the Group audit team has maintained appropriate 
oversight over both UK divisions for component reporting and reviewing purposes.
Outside of the planned visits regular discussions were held with the component audit teams throughout the year to direct and supervise the 
planning and execution of their audit work.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual Report, other than the Financial Statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any  
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we  
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the Financial 
Statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected 
material misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they 
consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 – Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit  
committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us  
to the audit committee; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code –  
the parts of the directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to  
the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing 
provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of these matters.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

is consistent with the Financial Statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
 
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain

Notes to the Consolidated Accounts 
For the year ended 31 December 2017 
1 Corporate information 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of National Express Group PLC and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 
were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 1 March 2018. National Express Group PLC is a public limited 
company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.  
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Strategic Report that accompanies these Financial Statements.  
2 Accounting policies  
Statement of compliance  
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and interpretations  
of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’), and with those parts  
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
Basis of preparation  
These Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis (see Group Finance Director’s Review on page 19) under the 
historical cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments.  
Prior year figures in the Group Income Statement and related notes have been restated to present separately the amounts relating to operations 
classified as discontinued in the current year. For further details see note 11. 
These Financial Statements are presented in pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand pounds (£0.1m) 
except where otherwise indicated. 
A summary of the Group’s accounting policies applied in preparing these Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 is set  
out below. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge, actual results  
may ultimately differ from those estimates.  
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods. 
i) Critical accounting judgements 
Pensions – defined benefit assets 
Judgement is required regarding the application of IFRIC 14 and the extent to which the Group can recognise defined benefit assets. Changes  
in this judgement could significantly impact the value of defined benefit pension balances recognised. 
National Express Group PLC operates a defined benefit scheme, which at year end was in a net surplus position as disclosed in note 34.  
Based on the terms and conditions of the scheme, and from consultation with independent advisers, the Group determined that an ultimate  
future economic benefit exists in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions. The surplus has therefore been recognised in full. 
ii) Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Pensions – assumptions 
Determining the amount of the Group’s retirement benefit obligations and the net costs of providing such benefits requires estimates to be made 
concerning long-term interest rates, inflation, salary and pension increases, investment returns and longevity of current and future pensioners. 
Changes in these estimates could significantly impact the amount of the obligations or the cost of providing such benefits. 
The Group makes assumptions concerning these matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified actuaries. Details of the 
assumptions made are set out in note 34, to these Financial Statements along with their sensitivities. 
Insurance and other claims  
The claims provision arises from estimated exposures at the year end for auto and general liability, workers’ compensation and environmental 
claims, the majority of which will be utilised in the next five years. The estimation of the claims provision is based on an assessment of the 
expected settlement of known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the 
Balance Sheet date but for which claims have not been reported to the Group. The Group makes assumptions concerning these judgemental 
matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified actuaries. 
In certain rare cases, additional disclosure regarding these claims may unfairly prejudice the Group’s position and consequently this disclosure  
is not provided. Given the differing types of claims, their size, the range of possible outcomes and the time involved in settling these claims, there  
is a reasonably possible chance that a material adjustment would be required to the carrying value of the claims provision in the next financial 
year. These different factors also make it impracticable to provide sensitivity analysis on one single measure and its potential impact on the overall 
claims provision.

2 Accounting policies continued 
Basis of consolidation  
These Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of National Express Group PLC and all its subsidiaries drawn  
up to 31 December each year. Adjustments are made to bring any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist into line with the Group’s 
accounting policies.  
On acquisition of a business, the purchase method of accounting is adopted, and the Group Income Statement includes the results of 
subsidiaries and businesses purchased during the year from the date control is assumed. The purchase consideration is allocated to assets and 
liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. On the sale of a business, the Group Income Statement includes the results of that 
business to the date of disposal.  
Intra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.  
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of comprehensive income and equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the  
parent Company shareholders and is presented separately from parent shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Changes in accounting policies and the adoption of new and revised standards 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following amendments to existing 
Standards which have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these 
Financial Statements. 
Amendment to IAS 12 – Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses, and 
Amendment to IAS 7 – Disclosure initiative ‘Changes in liabilities arising from financing activities’ 
The amendment to IAS 7 requires a disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. This has been presented in note 37(b).  
In order to provide a clear reconciliation to the new disclosure requirements of IAS 7, as well as to facilitate a clear reconciliation to the alternative 
cash performance measures in the Group Finance Director’s Review, certain cash flows within the Group Statement of Cash Flows for the 
comparative period have been recategorised, with no net change to the total movement in cash and cash equivalents as previously reported. 
Interests in joint ventures  
The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties to share control of other entities which represent joint ventures. The 
Group recognises its interest in the entities’ assets and liabilities using the equity method of accounting. The Group Balance Sheet includes the 
appropriate share of these joint ventures’ net assets or liabilities and the Income Statement includes the appropriate share of their results after tax.  
Financial statements of joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. Adjustments are made in the Group’s Financial 
Statements to eliminate the Group’s share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures. The Group 
ceases to use the equity method from the date it no longer has joint control over the entity.  
Interests in associates  
Companies, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights 
and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the appropriate share of 
these associates’ results and net assets based on their latest financial statements under the equity method of accounting. 
Income Statement presentation  
The Group Income Statement has been presented in a columnar format to enable users of the Financial Statements to view the normalised  
results of the Group. Normalised results are defined as the statutory results excluding intangible amortisation for acquired businesses, US tax 
reform, profit for the year from discontinued operations and consequent UK restructuring. The Board believes that this gives a more comparable 
year-on-year indication of the operating performance of the Group and allows the users of the financial statements to understand management’s 
key performance measures. Further details relating to separately disclosed items are provided in note 5.

Revenue recognition  
Rendering of services  
Revenue comprises income from road passenger transport, train passenger services and related activities in the UK, North America, Morocco  
and Europe. Where relevant, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax. Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion  
of the customer’s travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.  
UK and ALSA revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of 
local transport authorities, which is recognised as the services are provided. The relevant share of season ticket or travelcard income is deferred 
within liabilities and released to the Income Statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travelcard. 
Rail revenue in Germany comprises passenger revenues and subsidy income receivable from the Public Transport Authorities. Passenger  
revenue, which is allocated between the various transport providers in each region by the tariff authority responsible for that region, is recognised 
based on passenger counts, tariff authority estimates and historical trends. Subsidy income is recognised over the life of each franchise based on 
contractual entitlements including, where appropriate, indexation and other adjustments made or expected to be made to the subsidy entitlement. 
In accordance with IAS 20, the subsidy income recognised in each period reflects a systematic allocation of the total contractual subsidy 
entitlement, based on the expected profile of the underlying cost base which the subsidy is intended to compensate. Our revenue policy  
is to only recognise revenue where receipt is considered probable. 
North America revenue from school boards and similar contracts is recognised as the services are provided. 
Finance income  
Finance income is recognised using the effective interest method.  
Government grants  
Government grants relating to costs are recognised in the Income Statement on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group 
recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Government grants relating to property, plant and 
equipment are included in liabilities as deferred income and are credited to the Income Statement over the expected useful economic life of the 
assets concerned. 
Segmental reporting  
The Group’s continuing reportable segments comprise: UK (operates bus and coach services); German Rail; ALSA (operates bus and coach 
services); and North America (operates school bus and transit services). These segments are described in more detail in the Business review 
accompanying these Financial Statements. Central Functions is not a reportable segment but has been included in the segmental analysis  
in note 5 for transparency and to enable a reconciliation to the consolidated Group. 
Each of the Group’s reportable segments provide services of a similar nature and with similar economic characteristics. For the UK and German 
Rail the distinct segments align directly with the geographical locations in which they operate. The North America and ALSA business segments 
operate across more than one geographical location and as a result further sub-classifications of revenue and non-current assets are provided. 
The UK division includes operations previously reported as two separate segments: UK Bus and UK Coach. Following the discontinuation of UK 
Rail and the resulting simplified UK footprint, the Group has reorganised its UK management structure such that these businesses now report  
as one operating segment. Prior period segmental information has been restated accordingly. 
Leases  
Leases of property, plant and equipment where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group are 
capitalised in the Balance Sheet as property, plant and equipment. Finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased 
property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and 
finance leases is included as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the Income Statement over  
the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Property, plant and equipment 
acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.  
Leases of property, plant and equipment where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified 
as operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the Income Statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.  
All material arrangements and transactions entered into by the Group are reviewed to check whether they contain elements that meet the 
accounting definition of a lease, although they may not follow the legal form of a lease.

Borrowing costs  
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. 
Current tax and deferred tax  
Current tax is provided on taxable profits earned according to the local tax rates applicable where the profits are earned. Income taxes are 
recognised in the Income Statement unless they relate to an item accounted for in Other Comprehensive Income or Equity, in which case the tax 
is recognised directly in Other Comprehensive Income or Equity. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.  
Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of all material temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, apart from the following exceptions:  
− where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill;  
− where an asset or liability is recognised in a transaction that is not a business combination and that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and  
− in respect of investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences 
reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date on the same basis. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends  
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations  
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through  
a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale and either represents a separate 
major line of business or geographical area; is part of a plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area; or was an 
acquired subsidiary intended for resale. 
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and presented as a single amount after tax. Comparatives are also 
re-presented to reclassify the operation as discontinued. 
Intangible assets  
Intangible assets acquired separately that meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are capitalised at cost and when acquired  
in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, finite life assets are amortised  
on a straight-line basis and indefinite life assets are not amortised. The amortisation expense is taken to the Income Statement through  
operating costs.  
Finite life intangible assets have a residual value of £nil and are amortised as follows:  
Computer software that is integral to a tangible fixed asset is recognised within property, plant and equipment. 
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment. The useful lives of finite life intangible assets are examined on an annual 
basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Finite life assets are reviewed for impairment where indicators of 
impairment exist. 
The Group’s only indefinite life intangible asset is goodwill. 
Customer contracts  – over the life of the contract (between 1 and 33 years)  
Contract mobilisation costs  – over the life of the franchise (15 years)  
Software – over the estimated useful life (3-7 years)

Goodwill  
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the  
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is stated at historical cost less any 
accumulated impairment. If an acquisition gives rise to an excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost (previously referred to as negative goodwill), this is credited immediately to the Income Statement.  
In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised. All goodwill is subject to an annual test of impairment and an impairment charge recognised 
as required.  
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions. Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended within 
one year of the acquisition if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence 
gained post acquisition.  
On disposal of a cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.  
Property, plant and equipment  
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.  
Land and buildings comprise mainly vehicle depots and garages, and offices. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other property, plant and 
equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:  
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the Income Statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.  
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from  
the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the Income Statement in the period  
of derecognition.  
Impairment of non-financial assets  
All non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not  
be recoverable, except for goodwill which is reviewed annually. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount  
of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purposes  
of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows.  
In assessing value in use, the estimated risk adjusted future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement in expense categories 
consistent with the function of the impaired asset.  
Except for goodwill impairments, a review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether they no longer 
exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and any previously recognised impairment  
loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to assess the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was 
recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased, subject to a limit of the asset’s net book value had no previous 
impairment loss been recognised. Such reversal is recognised in the Income Statement. Future depreciation or amortisation is then adjusted  
to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount over its remaining useful economic life. Impairments to goodwill cannot be reversed. 
Freehold buildings  – 30 to 50 years  
Long leasehold property improvements  – 15 to 40 years  
Public service vehicles  – 8 to 16 years  
Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings  – 3 to 15 years

Financial instruments  
The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition. The Group classifies its financial assets in the following 
categories: at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; and available-for-sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which 
the financial assets were acquired.  
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss  
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. 
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.  
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the Income 
Statement. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented 
in the Income Statement within finance costs in the period in which they arise.  
Loans and receivables  
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the Balance Sheet.  
Available-for-sale financial assets  
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.  
The Group’s investments in entities that are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.  
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until  
the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is 
included in the Income Statement. Where there is no active market for the Group’s investments, fair value is determined using valuation 
techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flow analyses. In the absence of any other reliable external information, 
assets are carried at cost or amortised cost as appropriate.  
The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is 
impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below  
its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the 
cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial 
asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement. Impairment losses recognised  
in the Income Statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the Income Statement. 
Financial liabilities 
When a financial liability is recognised initially, the Group measures it at its fair value. Financial liabilities include trade payables, accruals, other 
payables, borrowings and derivative financial instruments. In the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, an adjustment is 
made for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. Subsequent measurement depends on its classification 
as follows: 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities classified as held for trading and derivative liabilities that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are classified as 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. These liabilities are carried on the Balance Sheet at fair value with gains or losses being 
recognised in the Income Statement. 
Other 
All other financial liabilities not classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as fuel derivatives, interest rate derivatives, foreign currency forward exchange contracts  
and cross currency swaps to hedge its risks associated with fuel price, interest rate fluctuations and foreign currency. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported Balance Sheet. The fair value of the 
derivatives is calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end.  
The Group’s fuel derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is recognised in equity, with any material ineffective portion recognised in the Income Statement. The gains or losses deferred in equity  
in this way are recycled through the Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is 
recognised in the Income Statement.  
The Group’s interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately  
in the Income Statement. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted through the Income Statement for the gain or loss on the hedged 
item attributable to the hedged risk, in this case movements in the risk free interest rate. 
Foreign currency derivatives and cross currency swaps are used to hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign currency denominated operations 
and to the extent they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against foreign exchange exposure in the 
related assets and liabilities. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold. 
The Group also uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain transactional exposures. These contracts are not hedge accounted and 
all gains and losses are taken directly to the Income Statement. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the Income Statement in the period.  
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting.  
Inventories  
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first in-first out basis, after making due allowance for obsolete or slow 
moving items. 
Contract mobilisation costs  
Costs associated with securing significant new franchises or contracts are expensed as incurred up to the point when a bid is a warded. From this 
point in time, appropriate costs are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the Income Statement over the life of the contr act. Costs associated 
with the commencement of all other new contracts are expensed as incurred.  
Trade and other receivables  
Trade and other receivables are recognised an d carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amoun ts. Doubtful debts  
are provided for when collection of the full amount is no long er probable, while bad debts are written off when identified.  
Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the Statement of Cash Flows comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access,  
other short-term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception, and bank overdrafts.  
In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts that have no  
legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.  
Trade and other payables  
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  
Interest-bearing borrowings  
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost being the net fair value of the consideration received plus transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issue of the financial asset or liability. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Insurance  
The Group’s policy is to self-insure high frequency claims within the businesses. To provide protection above these types of losses, the Group 
purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers. The insurance provision is based on estimated exposures  
at the year end principally for claims arising in the UK and North America prior to the year end date, subject to the overall deductible within the 
Group’s insurance arrangements. The majority of provisions will be utilised within five years, and the provisions have been discounted to take 
account of the expected timing of future cash settlements.  
Pensions and other post-employment benefits  
The Group has a number of pension schemes, both of a defined benefit and defined contribution nature. Full details are provided in note 34.  
The Balance Sheet position in respect of defined benefit schemes comprises the net of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation 
at the Balance Sheet date and the fair value of plan assets. Recognition of a net asset is limited so that it does not exceed the economic benefits 
available in the form of refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The trustees complete a full actuarial 
valuation triennially, separately for each plan, but the obligation is updated annually for financial reporting purposes by independent actuaries, 
using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows discounted using 
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related liability.  
Current service costs are recognised within operating costs in the Income Statement. Past service gains and losses are also recognised within 
operating costs and in the period in which the related plan amendment or curtailment occurs. Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate 
to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.  
The charges in respect of defined contribution schemes are recognised when they are due. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to 
pay further contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee 
service in the current and prior periods.  
Share-based payment  
The Group awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, under which the Group receives services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, 
excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining 
an employee of the Group over a specified time period). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 
that are expected to vest. The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified 
vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At each Balance Sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to 
vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.  
Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow  
of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material using a pre-tax discount rate. The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.  
Contingent liabilities are obligations that arise from past events that are dependent on future events. They are disclosed in the notes to the 
Financial Statements where the expected future outflow is not probable.

Share capital, share premium and dividends  
Where either the Company or employee share trusts purchase the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including 
any transaction costs, is deducted from total shareholders’ equity as own shares until they are cancelled or re-issued. Any consideration 
subsequently received on sale or re-issue is included in shareholders’ equity.  
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements on the date when  
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.  
Foreign currencies  
The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into Sterling, the presentation 
currency of the Group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year as a reasonable approximation to actual 
exchange rates at the dates of transactions.  
The balance sheets of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity. On disposa l of a foreign currency 
denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve (since 1 January 2004 under the tr ansitional rules of 
IFRS 1) relating to that entity is recognised in the Income Statement. All other translation differences are taken to the Income Statement, with the 
exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to provide a hedg e against the Group 
net investments in foreign enterprises. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which t ime they are recognised in 
the Income Statement.  
New standards and interpretations not applied  
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the Group has not applied the following standards that have been issued but are  
not yet effective: 
Title of standard IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
Nature of change IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard also introduces new rules  
for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. 
Impact The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and is expecting the following impacts from the adoption of the new standard  
on 1 January 2018. 
The new impairment model in IFRS 9 requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses rather tha n incurred credit  
losses under IAS 39. For trade and other receivables we intend to apply the simplified approach as permitted by IFRS 9. For sig nificant portfolios of 
receivables we will determine the expected credit losses using the matrix method. Based on initial assessment, our current expe ctation is that there will  
be a transitional increase in provisions of approximately £20m. This amount will be finalised as we refine the new approach dur ing 2018. The change is 
primarily in relation to older dated contract receivables in ALSA and North America where the perceived risk of default is cons idered greater due to their 
age. However, the increase purely reflects the requirement under IFRS 9 to make a forward looking assessment of risk of future default on existing 
receivables and does not reflect an actual increase in incurred credit losses.  
Under IFRS 9 the Group will elect to recognise its available-for-sale investments at fair value through Other Comprehensive Inc ome. Due to the unquoted 
nature of these investments and the limited amount of reliable external information, these assets have been historically recognised at cost less 
impairment. At 31 December 2017 the carrying value was £8.1m. Under IFRS 9, management anticipates applying a transitional redu ction to this carrying 
value of approximately £1.0m, reflecting a prudent approach to estimating the fair value of the investments using limited exter nal information. 
For hedge accounting we have assessed IFRS 9 and do not expect a material impact on the Group’s financial statements, other than certain disclosure 
points as referred to below. We anticipate that our hedging instruments will remain highly effective under IFRS 9 and the Group confirms that its current 
hedge relationships will qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of the new standard. 
Changes in the fair value of certain hedging instruments relating to forward points and currency basis spread will continue to be deferred within equity  
and recognised against the related hedged transactions when they occur. However, under IFRS 9 these movements will be separatel y stated within  
the financial instrument disclosures.  
IFRS 9 introduces expanded disclosure requirements. These are expected to change the extent of the Group’s disclosures about it s financial 
instruments, particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard. 
Date of adoption IFRS 9 will be adopted on 1 January 2018. The Group will apply the new rules prospectively from 1 January 2018, with the practi cal transition  
expedients permitted for retrospective application taken where app licable. No material restatements will be necessary for the c omparative period.

2 Accounting policies continued 
Title of standard IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
Nature of change IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 which currently covers the Group’s accounting for contracts of goods and services. IFRS 15 establishes principles for  
reporting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new s tandard is based  
on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer. 
Impact The Group has performed an initial assessment of the effects of applying the new standard and has concluded that while there ar e minor areas  
of difference they are not expected to have a mate rial impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
Just over half of Group revenue is derived from documented cont racts that cover periods of at least one year, with a significan t remainder being ticket  
and other sales to travelling customers and sh orter-term contracts such as private hire. 
A sample of contracts has been reviewed against IFRS 15, particul arly concerning the documented contracts that cover periods of at least one year,  
and further reviews are taking place in 2018. The review to date has covered all major revenue stream contracts across the Grou p, including school  
bus and transit operations in North America, urban and intercity services in ALSA and subsidy and other contracted income in th e UK. Based on the 
assessment, management has concluded that revenues are being appropriately recognised across the periods of the contract, as th e services are 
transferred to the customer. 
Ticket sale revenue has also been assessed and confirmed to be compliant with the new standard, with revenue recognised when th e passenger makes 
the journey or spread according to the term of the ticket, as ap propriate. Small instances of variable consideration, such as c ustomer loyalty points, 
discounts and refunds exist, and are appropriately accounted for under the new standard. 
Private hire operations are provided in the UK, ALSA and North America divisions and are typically of a short duration. A revie w of revenue recognition for 
these services confirmed that it is in accordance with IFRS 15, with revenue recognised in the period in which the private hire is provided to the customer. 
Date of adoption IFRS 15 will be adopted on 1 January 2018. We are not anticipating a material impact to the Group’s revenue recognition in futu re periods or any 
restatement necessary in the comparative period. 
 
Title of standard IFRS 16 Leases 
Nature of change IFRS 16 will result in an increase in the number of leases being recognised on the balance sheet as the distinction between ope rating and finance leases  
is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals will b e recognised. The income 
statement will also be affected, with the operating lease expense being replaced by a combination of depreciation on the right of use asset and interest  
on the financial liability. 
Short-term and low-value leases are excluded and will continue to be charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis o ver the term of the lease. 
Impact IFRS 16 will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating leases. By way of reference, the Group has non-cancellab le operating lease 
commitments at year end of £603.9m (see note 35). This is a gross value and does not reflect the discounting of the commitments to their present  
value as required by IFRS 16. The contracts will be assessed to ensure that these arrangements meet the definition of a lease u nder the new standard. 
The Group estimates that only a small proportion rela te to payments for short-term and low-value leases. 
A project to assess the impact of IFRS 16 is underway and will co mplete in 2018. This assessment is focusing on all of the Group ’s existing operating  
and finance leases, as well as considering any other contractual arrangements that may constitute a lease under the definitions of the new standard. 
Due to the ongoing project, it is not yet possible to estimate the amount of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that wil l have to be recognised on 
adoption of the new standard and how this may affect the Group’s income statement and classification of cash flows going forwar d. 
Date of adoption IFRS 16 will be adopted on 1 January 2019. As part of the ongoing assessment, the Group is considering the transitional options and will formally 
conclude on this in the second half of 2018.

4 Exchange rates 
The most significant exchange rates to UK Sterling for the Group are as follows: 
If the results for the year to 31 December 2016 had been retranslated at the average exchange rates for the year to 31 December 2017, North 
America would have achieved normalised operating profit of £88.5m on revenue of £924.3m, compared with normalised operating profit of 
£84.0m on revenue of £877.2m as reported, and ALSA would have achieved a normalised operating profit of £90.8m on revenue of £640.5m, 
compared with normalised operating profit of £84.7m on revenue of £597.3m as reported. 
5 Segmental analysis 
The Group’s reportable segments have been determined based on reports issued to and reviewed by the Group Executive Committee,  
and are organised in accordance with the geographical regions in which they operate and nature of services that they provide. Management 
considers the Group Executive Committee to be the chief decision-making body for deciding how to allocate resources and for assessing 
operating performance. 
The principal services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are as follows: 
UK – Bus and coach operations 
German Rail – Rail operations 
ALSA (predominantly Spain and Morocco) – Bus and coach operations 
North America (USA and Canada) – School bus and transit bus operations 
Further details on the activities of each segment are described in the Strategic Report. 
The UK division includes operations previously reported as two separate segments: UK Bus and UK Coach. Following the discontinuation of UK 
Rail and the resulting simplified UK footprint, the Group has reorganised its UK management structure such that these businesses now report as 
one operating segment. Prior period segmental information has been restated accordingly. 
Revenue is analysed by reportable segment as follows: 
There are no material inter-segment sales between reportable segments. 
No single external customer amounts to 10% or more of the total revenue. 
Due to the nature of the Group’s businesses, the origin and destination of revenue is the same.  
Revenue in ALSA comprises £610.5m (2016: £553.8m) in Spain, £45.7m (2016: £43.1m) in Morocco and £7.3m (2016: £0.4m) in Switzerland. 
Revenue in North America comprises £934.1m (2016: £798.7m) in the USA and £83.1m (2016: £78.5m) in Canada. 
Revenue in the UK comprises £273.8m (2016: £275.1m) of external revenue from bus operations and £287.7m (2016: £282.8m) from coach 
operations. Previously, these amounts were reported as the UK Bus and UK Coach segments respectively.

5 Segmental analysis continued 
Operating profit is analysed by reportable segment as follows: 
As disclosed in note 11, in February 2017 the Group disposed of its final UK rail franchise, c2c, as part of a broader UK strategic review in which 
the Group discontinued all activity in UK Rail. Consequent on this exit and given the simplified UK footprint, the Group also reorganised its UK 
management structure to reduce costs and facilitate better, clearer decision-making. The cost in the year relating to this restructuring was £5.6m. 
Depreciation is analysed by reportable segment as follows: 
Included in note 15 for 2016 is deprecation of £0.6m in relation to discontinued UK rail operations.

(b) Share schemes continued  
(i) Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)  
The LTIP was introduced in 2005 on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee to replace the annual award under the Executive  
Share Option Plan to Executive Directors and to certain senior employees. Under the LTIP, a Performance Award to acquire a specified number  
of free shares may be made to the employee or Director. Performance conditions are attached to the vesting of Performance Awards based  
on the achievement of target growth in earnings per share (‘EPS’), return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) and the relative total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) of the Company against a comparator group of companies. If the performance conditions are met, Performance Awards vest on the third 
anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to two years following the vesting date. There are no cash settlement 
alternatives at present.  
Since 2011, HMRC approved share option plans have been added as an appendix to the LTIP (‘Approved Plan’). A participant can only hold 
an option under the Approved Plan over shares with a market value of up to £30,000 at the grant date. Options under the Approved Plan are 
granted in tandem with the usual options under the LTIP. The options are structured such that on exercise, the proportion of the gain in respect  
of the first £30,000 worth of shares (as measured at the date of grant) will be delivered under the Approved Plan and the LTIP option shall be 
scaled back to deliver the remaining gross gain that would have been delivered had the option been granted alone. The excess shares under  
the LTIP will be forfeited such that both awards will never become fully vested. 
From 2012 to 2014, a supplementary five-year long-term incentive award was granted to the Chief Executive subject to targets linked to the 
Group’s five-year plan. This comprised a Performance Award (with no matching element). If performance conditions are met, the Performance 
Award will vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to 12 months following the vesting date.  
There are no cash settlement alternatives at present. 
(ii) West Midlands Travel Ltd (‘WMT’) Long Service Option Scheme  
The WMT Long Service Option Scheme utilises a fixed amount of shares set aside for this purpose following the acquisition of WMT in 1995 and  
is open to all WMT employees who have been in service for more than 25 years. The options are exercisable between three and ten years 
following the grant date. There are no cash settlement alternatives.  
(iii) TWM Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’)  
The TWM SIP exists for the benefit of WMT employees. At the end of the year, 1,079 (2016: 1,079) National Express Group PLC shares were held 
for the benefit of the Trustee. Dividends on shares held in the SIP forfeited shares account are waived. There are no cash settlement alternatives. 
(iv) Executive Deferred Bonus Plan 
As detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Committee considered it appropriate for bonuses awarded in respect of the calendar  
year to be deferred for a period of one year and that these would vest, subject to the terms of the award and the relevant Director’s continuing 
employment. The deferred forfeitable ordinary shares are awarded under the terms of the National Express Group Executive Deferred Bonus  
Plan which was adopted by the Board of the Company on 10 March 2009.  
The principal terms of awards under the Executive Deferred Bonus Plan are summarised below: 
− Awards under the Plan may be cash awards, conditional awards or forfeitable shares awards 
− Awards normally vest one year from the date of grant, subject to the relevant Director’s continued employment with the Company 
− The Committee may decide that participants shall be entitled to receive a benefit determined by reference to the value of the dividends that 
would have been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the grant date and the 
date of vesting 
− The awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment save in certain compassionate ‘good leaver’ circumstances (eg death or disability) 
In the event of a variation of the share capital of the Company, the Committee may make such adjustments to the awards 
as it considers appropriate.

8 Share-based payments 
The charge in respect of share-based payment transactions included in the Group’s Income Statement for the year is as follows: 
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group had four share-based payment arrangements, which are described in note 7(b).  
For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the weighted average 
exercise prices. The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 
The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had exercise prices that were between 129p and 590p (2016: between 129p and 599p) excluding 
options with a nil exercise price. The range of exercise prices for options was as follows: 
The options have a weighted average contractual life of one year (2016: one year). Options were exercised regularly throughout the year and the 
weighted average share price at exercise was 361p (2016: 347p).

8 Share-based payments continued 
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following 
assumptions and inputs: 
Experience to date has shown that approximately 24% (2016: 24%) of options are exercised early, principally due to leavers. This has been 
incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price. 
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historical volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not 
considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward. The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 
12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant. 
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the  
options above.

10 Taxation 
(a) Analysis of taxation charge in the year 
The tax credit on separately disclosed items of £20.0m comprises an £11.4m tax credit on intangibles, a £7.5m net credit in relation to the US tax 
rate reduction (see note 10(c)) and a tax credit of £1.1m for other items. 
The tax relief relating to intangible amortisation is determined by reference to the tax rates in the jurisdiction to which the intangible amortisation 
relates. The effective tax rate relating to intangible amortisation is significantly higher than the UK tax rate of 19.25% due to the weighting of 
intangibles in jurisdictions with higher tax rates than the UK, specifically the US (40%) and Spain (25%).

10 Taxation continued 
(c) Reconciliation of the total tax charge 
Included within the tax reconciliation are a number of non-recurring items, the effect of a reduction in tax rates and the release of tax provisions. 
Items expected to recur in the tax reconciliation for 2018 include the difference in rates between the UK and our overseas markets, tax incentives 
on re-investment credits and the merger of our Spanish businesses. 
The UK corporation tax rates has reduced in the year from 20.00% to 19.25% due to a reduction in the UK statutory corporation tax rate from 
20% to 19% from 1 April 2017. 
On 22 December 2017, the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017 was signed into law. The main change was to reduce the US federal corporate 
income tax rate from 35% to 21% from 1 January 2018. At the Balance Sheet date, the 21% rate (2016: 35%) was substantively enacted.  
This change in rate has resulted in a net tax credit of £7.5m to the Income Statement. In the prior year, the tax charge arising from changes  
in tax rates of £1.2m related to UK tax rate changes. 
(d) Tax provisions 
At 31 December 2016, the Group held tax provisions of £5.4m to cover tax uncertainties across our various markets. All UK corporation tax 
returns up to 2015 have been submitted and agreed by HMRC except for one outstanding matter. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group held tax provisions of £9.6m, representing a number of tax uncertainties such as the deductibility of interest 
expense in the UK and Spain and the Moroccan tax audits. There has been a net increase of £4.2m which represents the release of tax reserves 
where the statute of limitation has closed as well an increase of tax reserves relating to risks in our North American business. Based on the 
experience of the Group Tax department and after discussions of the various tax uncertainties with our tax advisers, the year end tax provision 
represents management’s best estimate of the tax uncertainties of which we are aware. The provision for the Group’s tax uncertainties of £9.6m  
is included in current tax liabilities. 
(e) Temporary differences associated with Group investments 
No deferred tax (2016: £nil) is recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, as the Group has determined 
that these undistributed profits will not be distributed in the near future. As a result of changes to tax legislation in 2009, overseas dividends 
received on or after 1 July 2009 are generally exempt from UK corporation tax, but may be subject to withholding tax. There are no temporary 
differences (2016: £nil) associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been 
recognised but for which a tax liability may arise. 
(f) Unrecognised tax losses 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit against future 
taxable profits is probable. Based on current forecasts, it is estimated that the losses recognised for deferred tax purposes will be utilised within 
three to four years. UK and overseas deferred tax assets that the Group has not recognised in the Financial Statements relates to gross losses  
of £17.7m (2016: £16.5m), which arise in tax jurisdictions where the Group does not expect to generate sufficient suitable future taxable profits. 
The majority of the unrecognised losses relates to UK entities where it is uncertain when, or if, the losses will be utilised.

11 Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale 
As previously announced, on 10 February 2017 the Group disposed of its only UK rail franchise, National Express Essex Thameside ‘c2c’,  
to Trenitalia and as a result has recognised all UK rail operating activity as discontinued. 
On 22 March 2017, Transport for West Midlands announced its intention to take over the running of the Midland Metro tram operations at the  
end of the current franchise. We have therefore also shown this as discontinued. 
Prior period figures have been restated to present separately the above operations as discontinued. 
Details of the discontinued operations are as follows: 
Details of assets and liabilities held for sale in the prior year, which relate to c2c, are disclosed in the Financial Statements for the year ended

13 Earnings per share 
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders of £131.0m (2016: £117.2m) by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust (note 32) which are treated as cancelled. 
Basic EPS for continuing operations is calculated by dividing the earnings from the continuing Group attributable to equity shareholders of 
£125.1m (2016: £112.1m). Basic and diluted EPS in the year for discontinued operations was 1.2p (2016: 1.0p) and 1.1p (2016: 1.0p) 
respectively. 
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is adjusted to include the weighted av erage number  
of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

The calculation of value in use for each group of cash-generating units is most sensitive to the assumptions over discount rates and the growth 
rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period of the management plan.  
The key assumptions used for the cash-generating units are as follows: 
The growth rates used to extrapolate cash flow projections are derived from financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management 
covering a three-year period. The assumptions in these forecasts, which include growth rates and operating margins, are based on historical 
experience and detailed budget plans as well as management’s assessment of current market and economic conditions. Long term growth rates 
take into account any known events which would impact cash flows outside of the three year planning period and are set with reference to long 
term CPI rates and projected GDP growth.  
The pre-tax discount rates applied are calculated from country-specific weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’). In 2016, the discount rate  
used was a single blended Group WACC. In 2017, management consulted with independent advisers and updated the approach, now applying 
country-specific discount rates to better reflect the prevailing economic risk to cash flows of each CGU. 
The value in use of the North America division exceeds its carrying amount by £557.3m (2016: £252.2m); the significant increase in value in use 
being partially driven by the reduction in US corporation tax rate from 35% to 21%. 
The value in use of the ALSA division exceeds its carrying amount by £189.7m (2016: £261.8m). 
Sensitivities to key and other assumptions 
The sensitivity analysis below has been presented in the interests of transparency and consistency only. It is not believed that any reasonably 
possible movement in key and other assumptions will lead to an impairment. 
Sensitivity analysis has been completed on each key assumption in isolation. This indicates that the value in use of the North America division  
will be equal to its carrying value with an increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 2.3% (2016: 1.5%) or a reduction in the growth rates used to 
extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period of the management plan of 2.5% (2016: 1.5%). 
In addition, for North America, a reduction in operating profit margin of 2.5% (2016: 1.6%) will result in the value in use of the division being equal 
to its carrying amount. North America’s operating profit margin for 2017 was 9.3% (2016: 9.6%). 
For ALSA, sensitivity analysis on each key assumption indicates that the value in use will be equal to its carrying amount following an increase in 
the pre-tax discount rate of 0.9% (2016: 1.4%) or a reduction in growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period of the 
management plan of 0.9% (2016: 1.6%). 
A reduction in ALSA’s operating profit margin of 1.5% (2016: 2.5%) will result in the value in use of the division being equal to its carrying amount. 
ALSA’s operating profit margin for 2017 was 14.3% (2016: 14.2%). 
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each cash-generating unit and to be realistically 
achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts and therefore that goodwill is not impaired.

Following a review of property, plant and equipment in the year, it was identified that a number of movements relating to past acquisitions had the 
effect of misstating brought forward balances and movements in the comparative year. For both the movements and the opening balances, cost 
and depreciation were misstated by equal and opposite amounts and therefore the effect on net book values was £nil. The above table has been 
restated to show revised movements in the comparative year and revised opening and closing balances for both cost and depreciation.

(a) Acquisitions – North America continued 
Trade and other receivables had a fair value and a gross contractual value of £4.7m. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash 
flows not to be collected was £nil. 
Goodwill of £51.5m arising from the acquisitions consists of certain intangible benefits that cannot be separately identified and measured due to 
their nature. This includes control over the acquired businesses and increased scale in our North American operations, along with synergy benefits 
expected to be achieved. 
Included in the consideration shown above is contingent consideration of £38.4m relating to three acquisitions. For the first acquisition, the  
Group is required to pay consideration on renewal of contracts on a 5-year or 10-year basis. For the second acquisition, the Group is required  
to pay an indemnity contingent on the performance of seller’s indemnification obligations or other post-closing obligations under the acquisition 
agreement. On the third acquisition, the Group is required to pay consideration on renewal of a significant contract and the contingent 
consideration is dependent on the renewed revenue level. The payment under these arrangements is dependent on meeting the respective 
conditions, with a minimum expected undiscounted payment of £nil and maximum expected undiscounted payment of £38.4m. Based on 
projections, management expects the maximum amount to be paid. The amount recognised is undiscounted as the effect of discounting  
is not material. 
The acquired businesses contributed £25.7m of revenue and £6.0m to the Group’s profit for the periods between the dates of acquisition and the 
Balance Sheet date. Had the acquisitions been completed on the first day of the financial year, the Group’s continuing revenue for the year would 
have been £2,367.6m and the Group’s continuing operating profit would have been £205.7m. 
(b) Acquisitions – ALSA 
During the year the ALSA division acquired 100% control of six businesses in Spain and Switzerland, none of which are material individually: 
− Odier Excursions SA – tourist charter and other transportation services in Geneva, Switzerland 
− Transportes Santo Domingo S.L. – urban bus services in Madrid, Spain 
− Tranvías Metropolitanos de Granada – regional bus services in Granada, Spain 
− Maitours S.L. – charter and school bus transportation in Madrid, Spain 
− Chamexpress – airport transfers from Geneva to French and Swiss mountain resorts 
− GVA Transfers – airport transfers from Geneva to French and Swiss mountain resorts

(b) Acquisitions – ALSA continued 
Trade and other receivables had a fair value and a gross contractual value of £2.7m. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash 
flows not to be collected was £nil. 
Goodwill of £11.6m arising from the acquisitions consists of certain intangible benefits that cannot be separately identified and measured due to 
their nature. This includes control over the acquired businesses and increased scale in our operations in Spain and Switzerland, along with 
synergy benefits expected to be achieved. 
There are no contingent amounts within the consideration for the above ALSA acquisitions. 
The acquired businesses contributed £6.8m of revenue and £1.5m to the Group’s profit for the periods between the dates of acquisition and the 
Balance Sheet date. Had the acquisitions been completed on the first day of the financial year, the Group’s continuing revenue for the year would 
have been £2,327.7m and the Group’s continuing operating profit would have been £198.7m. 
(c) Acquisitions – further information 
Deferred consideration of £44.5m was paid in the year relating to acquisitions in North America in earlier years. Total cash outflow in the year from 
acquisitions in the North America division was therefore £76.0m, comprising consideration for current year acquisitions of £35.7m and deferred 
consideration of £44.5m, less cash acquired in the businesses of £4.2m. 
In addition for North America, during the year there was reduction to the provisional fair values of businesses acquired in the prior year of £9.5m. 
Total cash outflow in the year from acquisitions in the ALSA division was £16.7m, comprising consideration of £18.3m, less cash acquired in the 
businesses of £1.6m. 
In December 2016, the UK division acquired E Clarke & Son (Coaches) Limited. The fair values of net assets were adjusted in 2017 resulting in 
additional goodwill of £1.4m. In addition, £4.5m of deferred consideration relating to the acquisition was settled during 2017. 
(d) Disposals 
On 10 February 2017, the Group disposed of the National Express Essex Thameside ‘c2c’ franchise to Trenitalia. The consideration received was 
£71.8m. Cash in the business on disposal was £14.9m and cash outflows in the year relating to costs of disposal were £14.1m, therefore the net 
cash inflow in the year from the disposal was £42.8m. 
Further details of this disposal are disclosed in note 11.

22 Current assets – trade and other receivables 
An analysis of the provision for impairment of receivables is provided below: 
Amounts included within trade receivables which are past due at the reporting date are shown in note 30. 
Certain amounts included within current and non-current other receivables are in relation to insurance claims awaiting settlement. Additional 
disclosure regarding these claims may unfairly prejudice the Group’s position and consequently this disclosure is not provided. None of the 
remaining amounts within other receivables are individually material. 
In order to provide greater clarity of receivables, grants and subsidies have been presented separately, with a recategorisation of the prior year 
comparatives. Specifically, £4.9m was recategorised from trade receivables and £29.3m from other receivables. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value. 
23 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash at bank and in hand earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made for varying periods  
of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the agreed short-term 
floating deposit rate. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is equal to the carrying value.

24 Current liabilities – trade and other payables 
Trade payables are normally settled on 30-day terms and other payables have an average term of four months.  
Included within other payables are deferred fixed asset grants from government or other public bodies of £0.7m (2016: £0.4m), amounts payable 
for the purchase of property, plant and equipment of £101.7m (2016: £126.4m) and factoring of German Rail revenues of £12.5m (2016: £6.3m). 
Other payables also includes £54.0m (2016: £54.6m) of deferred consideration for businesses acquired, of which £49.2m (2016: £46.7m) relates 
to businesses acquired in the year (note 19). 
Following a review of payables, management determined that it would improve the presentation to disclose payables relating to payroll-related 
payments within accruals and deferred income. Previously these were disclosed within other payables. A restatement of £40.6m has been made 
to the respective amounts in the comparative year. 
25 Other non-current liabilities 
Other liabilities includes £32.5m (2016: £14.7m) of deferred consideration for businesses acquired, of which £25.8m (2016: £10.2m) relates to 
businesses acquired in the year (note 19). 
26 Provisions 
1
 The claims provision arises from estimated exposures at the year end for auto and general liability, workers’ compensation and environmental claims, the majority of which  
will be utilised in the next five years. It comprises provisions for claims arising in the UK and North America. 
2
 Other primarily relates to amounts provided for restructuring activities. The majority will be utilised within one year, with the remainder expected to be utilised within the next  
five years. 
When the effect is material, the provisions are discounted to their net present value.

29 Interest-bearing borrowings continued 
In 2017, the Group entered into additional unsecured committed revolving credit facilities totalling £32.0m. The facilities are on the same terms as 
the Group’s existing £512m bank facilities. All facilities mature in November 2021. At 31 December 2017, there was €nil (2016: €nil) drawn down 
on the facilities, with £2.0m of capitalised deal fees remaining. 
In November 2016, the Group issued a £400m seven-year Sterling bond with a coupon of 2.5%. The proceeds were used to repay the £350m 
Sterling bond that matured in January 2017, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes. 
In November 2017, the Group issued €250.0m two and a half year floating rate notes at EURIBOR +0.4% and in July 2017 entered into  
a $130.0m floating term loan at US Dollar LIBOR +0.75%, maturing in April 2018, both used for general corporate purposes. 
Under the terms of the £1bn Euro Medium Term Note (‘EMTN’) programme, there is a change in control put option such that, upon a change  
of control event, any note holder may require the Company to redeem or purchase that MTN. 
Details of the Group’s interest rate risk management strategy and associated interest rate derivatives are included in notes 30 and 31. 
The Group is subject to a number of financial covenants in relation to its syndicated credit facilities which, if contravened, could result in its 
borrowings under those facilities becoming immediately repayable. These covenants specify maximum net debt to EBITDA and minimum EBITDA 
to net interest payable.

30 Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Financial risk factors and management 
The Group’s multinational operations and debt levels expose it to a variety of financial risks, of which the most material are market risks relating  
to fuel prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the availability of funding at reasonable margins. The Group has in place a risk 
management programme that seeks to manage the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group by using financial instruments 
including borrowings, committed facilities and forward foreign exchange, fuel and interest rate derivatives. 
The Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility for implementing the financial risk management policies laid down by the Board to the 
Group Finance Director and the Group Treasurer. The policies are implemented by the Group Treasury department with regular reporting to the 
Group Finance Director and the Audit Committee on its activities. 
Foreign currency 
The Group has major foreign operations in the USA, Canada, Spain and Germany and as a result is exposed to the movements in foreign  
currency exchange rates on the translation of these foreign currency denominated net assets and earnings. These movements can have a 
significant impact on the Group’s reported results. The Group seeks to manage this foreign currency exchange movement risk by aligning its 
foreign currency denominated liabilities with the EBIT generated in each currency, such that some protection is afforded to the net debt: EBITDA 
covenant within the Group’s core borrowing facility. This is achieved by a combination of foreign currency borrowings and finance leases, and 
entering into derivative financial instruments such as cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. At the year end, the Group 
had outstanding foreign exchange derivatives for net investment purposes of €176.3m, USD158.3m and CAD92.0m, outstanding cross currency 
interest rate swaps of €222.7m and €114.6m and finance leases of USD212.0m and €17.3m. 
Foreign exchange and cross currency interest rate swaps are derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign 
currency assets. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
recycled to the Income Statement at the same time as the underlying hedged net assets affect the Income Statement. Any material ineffectiveness 
is taken to the Income Statement. 
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates,  
with all other variables held constant. This would affect the Group’s profit before tax and translation reserve. The effect on the translation reserve 
represents the movement in the translated value of the foreign currency denominated loans and change in fair value of cross currency swap 
contracts. These movements would be offset by an opposite movement in the translated value of the Group’s overseas net investments. It is 
estimated that a 10% change in the corresponding exchange rates would result in an exchange gain or loss in the translation reserve of £67.1m.

Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates on both interest-bearing assets and liabilities. It is the Group’s policy to maintain an 
appropriate balance between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide a level of certainty to interest expense in the  
short term and to reduce the year-on-year impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term. To achieve the desired fixed/floating ratio,  
the Group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps that have the effect of converting fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. The net effect  
of these transactions was that as at 31 December 2017 the proportion of the Group’s gross debt at floating rates was 43% (2016: 24%).  
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other 
variables held constant, on the Group’s profit before tax and on the Group’s hedging reserve.  
The sensitivity analysis covers all floating rate financial instruments, including the interest rate swaps. If the interest rates applicable to floating rate 
instruments were increased by 100bps it is estimated that the Group’s profit before taxation would increase by approximately £1.6m relating to 
Sterling, £0.2m relating to the US Dollar and decrease £2.8m relating to the Euro. The analysis assumes that the amount and mix of floating rate 
debt, including finance leases, remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2017.

Commodity prices 
The Group is exposed to movements in commodity prices as a result of its fuel usage. It is the Group’s policy to hedge this exposure in order  
to provide a level of certainty as to its cost in the short term and to reduce the year-on-year impact of price fluctuations over the medium term. 
This is achieved by entering into fuel derivatives. At 31 December 2017, the Group had hedged approximately 95% of its 2018 expected usage, 
71% of its expected usage in 2019 and 35% of its expected usage in 2020 (see the Group Finance Director’s review for further details). 
The table below demonstrates the effect of a reasonably possible variation in fuel prices, with all other variables held consta nt, on the fair value of the 
Group’s financial instruments and accordingly on the Group’s profit before tax and on the Group’s hedging reserve. 
The sensitivity analysis includes all fuel derivatives. The effect on the hedging reserve arises through movements on the fair value of the Group’s 
fuel derivatives. For these derivative contracts the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 10% increase or decrease in all prices would 
have been £15.5m at 31 December 2017. The figure does not include any corresponding economic advantage or disadvantage that would arise 
from the natural business exposure which would be expected to offset the gain or loss on the derivatives. 
Credit risk 
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group is the gross carrying value of each of its financial assets. This risk is mitigated by a number  
of factors. Many of the Group’s principal customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which it conducts business are local public  
(or quasi-public) bodies, including school boards in North America, municipal authorities in Spain and Morocco, Transport for London and  
the West Midlands Combined Authority in the UK, and regional authorities in Germany. The Group does not consider these counterparties  
to pose a significant credit risk. Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group has 
implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence. 
The only elements of the Group’s financial assets which are not impaired but are past due are certain trade receivable items. An ageing of  
the assets which are past due is included in the following table. In terms of trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are 
no confirmed indications as at the year end reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations (see Risk and risk management 
section for details of how management manages this process). 
Trade receivables more than 90 days primarily relate to amounts receivable from public authorities in ALSA and receivables for school bus 
services in North America where amounts are settled on approval from the local governing bodies at the end of the school period. The Directors 
believe that based on the ongoing contractual relationships with predominantly public bodies these amounts will be collected.

Liquidity risk 
The Group’s liquidity risk is centrally managed by the Group Treasury department with operating units forecasting their cash requirements.  
The Group actively maintains a mixture of medium and long-term committed facilities designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds 
to meet current and forecast funding requirements. In managing liquidity risk, the Group has access to a range of funding sources through the 
banking and capital markets. 
In November 2017, the Group issued €250.0m two and a half year floating rate notes at EURIBOR +0.4% and in July 2017 entered into a 
$130.0m floating term loan at US dollar LIBOR +0.75%, maturing in April 2018, both used for general corporate purposes. 
In December 2017, the Group entered into an additional unsecured committed revolving credit facility of £32m. This facility is on the same terms 
as the Group’s existing £512m unsecured committed revolving credit facilities and mature in November 2021. At 31 December 2017, there was 
£nil (2016: £nil) drawn down on the facilities. 
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2017 based on the contractual undiscounted 
cash flows including interest cash flows. As such, the amounts in this table will not agree to the carrying amounts disclosed in the Balance Sheet 
or other notes. The table includes cash flows associated with derivative hedging instruments. Their amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair 
value liability where the instrument will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately 
to the receive leg.

Capital risk management 
The Group seeks to adopt efficient financing structures that enable it to use its Balance Sheet strength to achieve the Group’s objectives without 
putting shareholder value at risk. The Group’s capital structure comprises its equity (refer to the Group Statement of Changes in Equity) and its net 
debt (refer to note 37).  
The increase in the Group’s net debt from £878.0m to £887.9m (excluding accrued interest) is explained in the Group Finance Director’s Review. 
Information about the financial covenants in relation to the Group’s borrowing facilities is included in note 29.

31 Financial instruments (including cash, trade receivables and payables) 
Fair values 
The table overleaf illustrates the fair values of all financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at 31 December 2017. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  
They are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and the carrying value in all cases approximates to the fair value.  
Available-for-sale investments are non-derivative assets that are either designated as available for sale, or are not classified as loans and 
receivables or held to maturity investments. The Group’s available-for-sale investments have no active market, and in the absence of any  
other reliable external information are carried at cost or amortised cost which approximates to the fair value. 
The Group’s derivatives are measured at fair value. The fair value of these instruments is either determined by the third-party financial institution 
with which the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar financial instruments, or by use of valuation techniques using 
market data. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are classified as fair value through profit or loss and are 
carried on the Balance Sheet at their fair value with gains or losses recognised in the Income Statement. Derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the Balance Sheet at their fair value. For cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in Other Comprehensive Income,  
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Income Statement. Amounts taken to Other Comprehensive Income are transferred to the  
Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss or when the foreign operation is sold or partially disposed. For fair value 
hedges, all gains or losses are recognised in the Income Statement. 
The fair value measurement of derivative instruments is categorised within Level 2 (ie the fair values are derived based on observable market 
inputs). The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs, ie those that 
would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, other than the deferred contingent consideration disclosed in note 19. There have not 
been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy and there are no non-recurring fair value movements. 
The Group’s bonds are held at a hybrid amortised cost with a fair value adjustment. After initial recognition at fair value, the bonds are measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. A portion of the bonds is designated as the hedged item in an effective fair value 
hedging relationship. As such, the carrying value of this portion is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. This net 
carrying value will differ to the fair value depending on movements in the Group’s credit risk, movements in interest rates on the un-hedged 
portion and unamortised fees. 
All other liabilities, including finance leases, bank loans, trade and other payables and other debt payable, are held at amortised cost. After initial 
fair value recognition, these instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying value of these 
liabilities approximates to the fair value.

The Group assesses at each year end reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. In the financial year 2017, 
there was no objective evidence that would have necessitated the impairment of loans and receivables or available-for-sale assets except the 
provision for impairment of receivables (see note 22). 
Hedging activities 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to market risk, such as movements in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices 
and interest rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. In line 
with IAS 39 the Group classifies hedges as (a) fair value hedges used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or 
liability, (b) cash flow hedges used to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable 
forecast transaction, and (c) hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.  
In 2017, the Group applied cash flow hedge accounting to hedge floating fuel price risks in highly probable forecast purchase transactions and  
for hedging net investments in its US Dollar and Euro foreign operations. The Group also applied fair value hedge accounting on £100m of the 
Group’s fixed rate bonds and €78.5m Private Placement to hedge changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.

Hedge of net investments in foreign entities 
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments to hedge the net investment in material foreign currency  
net assets of the Group which are used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange rate movements. At 31 December 2017, the Group had 
designated €176.3m of synthetic debt in the form of foreign exchange derivatives, €222.7m in cross currency interest rate swaps, a €250.0m 
FRN, a €114.6m term loan and a €78.5m Private Placement as net investment hedges of the net assets of its Euro subsidiaries. Similarly, 
USD158.5m and CAD92.0m of synthetic debt in the form of foreign exchange derivatives were designated as a hedge of the net assets  
of the Group’s North America subsidiaries. No ineffectiveness was recognised in relation to these hedges. 
Fuel derivatives 
The Group has a number of fuel derivatives in place to hedge the different types of fuel used in each division. Fuel swaps are used to match the 
timing, type of fuel and currency in which the domestic physical fuel is purchased as closely as possible, with hedges currently in place from 2018 
through to 2020.  
During the year £5.3m of fair value losses (2016: £27.0m gains) have been transferred to the hedging reserve due to movements in market  
fuel prices. A fair value loss of £23.6m (2016: £43.7m loss) has been transferred from the hedging reserve to the Income Statement following 
settlement of fuel trades, of which £2.8m was recognised in the hedging reserve at 1 January 2017 and the remainder was generated during  
the year due to the movement in market fuel prices. Due to immateriality, £nil was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to 
hedge ineffectiveness (2016: £nil). 
Fuel derivatives can be analysed as follows: 
Interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss 
In July 2010, the Group entered into two £50m interest rate swaps that pay floating interest (LIBOR + margin) semi-annually and receive fixed 
interest annually. These are designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk with maturities matching the Group’s £225m Sterling bonds 
maturing in June 2020. These swaps are measured at fair value through profit or loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the 
Income Statement to offset any fair value gains or losses due to changes in the risk-free interest rate on the swapped portion of the bonds. As at 
31 December 2017, a total fair value loss of £4.1m was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to these swaps. This is offset by a fair 
value gain of £4.1m on the underlying hedged item, in this case changes in fair value on £100m of the Group’s £225m bonds due to changes in 
the risk-free interest rate. 
In September 2012, the Group entered into two €39.25m denominated interest rate swaps equal in value to the Euro Private Placement. These 
interest rate swaps all pay floating interest (EURIBOR + margin) semi-annually, receive fixed interest annually with maturities matching the Euro 
Private Placement and are designated as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk on the Private Placement. These swaps are measured at fair 
value through profit and loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the Income Statement to offset any fair value gains or losses  
due to changes in the risk-free rate on the Euro Private Placement. As at 31 December 2017, a total fair value gain of £1.1m was recognised in 
the Income Statement in relation to these swaps. This is offset by a fair value loss of £1.1m on the underlying hedged item, in this case changes in 
fair value of the Euro Private Placement due to changes in the risk-free interest rate.

34 Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
(a) Summary of pension benefits and assumptions 
The UK division (‘UK’) and National Express Group PLC (the ‘Company’) operate both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. 
Subsidiaries in North America contribute to a number of defined contribution plans. 
The Group also provides certain additional unfunded post-employment benefits to employees in North America and ALSA, and maintains a small 
defined benefit scheme for National Express Services Limited, previously part of the UK Rail division. The principal UK Rail defined benefit scheme 
was transferred to Trenitalia as part of the disposal of NXET Trains Limited on 10 February 2017 (note 11). Post-employment benefits for North 
America, ALSA and UK rail have been combined into the ‘Other’ category.  
With effect from 30 June 2017, the assets and liabilities of the Tayside Transport Fund (a defined benefit pension scheme for certain past and 
present employees of Tayside Public Transport Company Limited, a subsidiary of the UK Bus division) were transferred into the Tayside Pension 
Fund (a fund administered by Dundee City Council). The Group will continue to make contributions into the Tayside Pension Fund in respect of 
current service costs on the basis of a fixed percentage of pensionable pay and will account for this on a defined contribution basis. Prior to 
transfer, the Tayside Transport Fund was in a net surplus position and had been derecognised in full. 
The assets of the defined benefit schemes are held separately from those of the Group and contributions to the schemes are determined by 
independent professionally qualified actuaries. 
In 2017, the UK division agreed a three-year annual deficit repayment plan with the trustees of the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority 
Pension Fund, which continues until March 2020 with an average contribution of £7.7m per annum. The plan remains open to accrual for existing 
members only. 
The Group expects to contribute approximately £10.0m to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018. 
The total pension cost charged to operating profit in the year for the continuing Group was £8.7m (2016: £7.4m), of which £3.9m (2016: £3.7m) 
relates to the defined contribution schemes.

(a) Summary of pension benefits and assumptions continued  
Key risks relating to the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are as follows: 
Investment risk 
The present values of scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if the return on scheme 
assets is below this yield, it will create a deficit. The UK scheme holds a significant proportion of return-seeking assets (equities and diversified 
growth funds) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The Company 
scheme, which holds a net surplus position and is closed to future accrual, primarily holds bonds. 
Interest risk 
A decrease in bond interest rates will increase scheme liabilities but this will be partially offset by an increase in the returns on the scheme assets. 
Inflation risk 
A significant proportion of the schemes’ obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The Group has some 
inflation linking in its revenue streams, which helps to offset this risk. In addition, the UK scheme holds a small proportion of index-linked bonds 
which will help to protect against this risk and the Company scheme holds a liability driven investment portfolio which seeks to hedge against 
inflation. 
Longevity risk 
The majority of the schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase 
in the liabilities. The Company scheme is closed to future accrual, thereby reducing exposure to increases in longevity risk. The UK scheme 
includes a buy-in policy covering part of the pensioner members’ liabilities, which partly helps to mitigate longevity risk. 
Legislative risk 
Future legislative changes are uncertain. In the past these have led to both increases in obligations; for example, reduced investment return 
through the ability to reclaim Advance Corporation Tax, and decreases in obligations; for example, through the ability to use CPI inflation instead  
of RPI to set pension increase rates. The Company scheme is closed to future accrual, thereby reducing exposure to legislative change. For the 
UK scheme the Group receives professional advice on the impact of legislative changes. 
The valuations conducted for financial reporting purposes are based on the triennial actuarial valuations. A summary of the latest triennial actuarial 
valuations for the principal schemes, and assumptions made, is as follows:

(a) Summary of pension benefits and assumptions continued 
The Directors regard the assumptions around pensions in payment, discount rate, inflation and mortality to be the key assumptions in the IAS 19 
valuation. The following table provides an approximate sensitivity analysis of a reasonably possible change to these assumptions: 
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective Balance Sheet dates. The expected rate of return on scheme assets is 
determined based on market returns on each category of scheme assets.

(2016: £2.7m) from unfunded plans. 
Based on the terms and conditions of the Company scheme, and from consultation with independent advisers, the Group determined that  
an ultimate future economic benefit exists in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions. Therefore, in accordance with IFRIC 14,  
the closing defined benefit surplus of this scheme has been recognised.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income since 1 January 2004 is a £128.2m 
loss (2016: £114.2m loss). The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs  
and taken directly to equity of £51.9m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes. Consequently the 
Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income before 1 January 2004.

35 Commitments and contingencies continued 
Finance lease commitments 
The Group has finance leases for public service vehicles and various items of plant and equipment. These leases have terms of renewal but no 
purchase options and escalation clauses. Renewals are at the option of the specific entity that holds the lease. 
Capital commitments 
The Group is committed to vehicle purchases and various land and buildings improvements. 
Contingent liabilities 
Guarantees 
The Group has guaranteed credit facilities totalling £24.7m (2016: £36.1m) of certain joint ventures. 
Bonds and letters of credit 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group is required to issue counter-indemnities in support of its operations. As at 31 December 2017, there 
were Rail performance bonds of £6.3m (2016: £64.1m) and Rail season ticket bonds of £nil (2016: £22.5m). The Group has other performance 
bonds which include performance bonds in respect of businesses in the US of £148.3m (2016: £159.5m) and in Spain of £41.9m (2016: £41.4m). 
There are also bonds of £5.9m relating to operations in the Middle East (2016: £6.5m). Letters of credit have been issued to support insurance 
retentions of £91.9m (2016: £91.5m). 
Tax 
Tax authorities in the markets in which we operate (UK, Spain, Germany, USA, Canada and Morocco) carry out tax audits from time to time.  
As was detailed in note 10(d) Tax provisions, the current ongoing tax audits relate to our Moroccan business where we expect an outcome with 
any tax payment made to be immaterial to the tax charge.  
The Directors are satisfied that, based on current knowledge, adequate tax provisions are held to cover any tax uncertainties. The Group has tax 
provisions at 31 December 2017 of £9.6m (2016: £5.4m). There are no material contingent liabilities relating to tax.

Company Statement of Changes in Equity  
For the year ended 31 December 2017 
The Company’s profit and loss account includes £289.5m (2016: £303.5m) that is available for distribution. Cumulative gains on the Company’s 
defined benefit pension scheme, which is currently in a net surplus position, are deemed to be not distributable. In addition, own shares have 
been purchased out of distributable profits and therefore reduce the reserves available for distribution. The share premium and capital redemption 
reserves are not distributable. 
Details of dividends paid, declared and proposed during the year are given in note 12 to the consolidated accounts.

In applying these policies, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
The Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 in relation to share-based payments, financial 
instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, 
standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are included 
within the consolidated accounts. 
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit attributable  
to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Company’s balance sheet. 
Tangible fixed assets  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:  
The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not 
be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss 
account during the financial period in which they are incurred.  
Investments in subsidiaries  
Investments are held at historical cost less any provision for impairment.

1 Accounting policies continued 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings  
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against fixed interest 
rate borrowings. Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each Balance Sheet date by the change in fair 
value attributable to the interest rate being hedged. 
Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where the Company expects a 
provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.  
Pensions  
The Company participates in both the National Express Group Staff Pension Fund (a defined benefit scheme) and a defined contribution scheme. 
For the defined benefit scheme, the Balance Sheet position comprises the net of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the 
Balance Sheet date and the fair value of plan assets. The trustees complete a full actuarial valuation triennially but the obligation is updated 
annually for financial reporting purposes by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the obligation is 
determined by the estimated future cash outflows discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity 
equivalent to the terms of the related liability.  
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised as operating costs. Past service gains and losses 
are also recognised within operating costs and in the period in which the related plan amendment or curtailment occurs. Net interest is calculated 
by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses arising 
from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the profit and loss reserve in the period in which 
they arise.  
For the defined contribution scheme, the amount charged to the profit and loss is the contributions payable in the year. Differ ences between 
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sh eet. 
Share-based payment  
The Company awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, under which the Company receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, 
excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining 
an employee of the Company over a specified time period). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the 
specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income 
Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
Foreign currencies  
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end. Foreign currency transactions 
arising during the year are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction. Any exchange differences so 
arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.

1 Accounting policies continued 
Deferred tax  
Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of all material temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, apart from where the Company is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences 
reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date on the same basis. 
Derivative financial instruments  
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate derivatives, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross 
currency swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and foreign currency. Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported Balance Sheet. The fair value of the derivatives is calculated by 
reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.  
The Company’s interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised 
immediately in the Income Statement. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted through the Income Statement for the gain or loss on 
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in this case movements in the risk free interest rate. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the 
hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
Foreign currency derivatives and cross currency swaps are used to hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign currency denominated 
operations. For the Company, gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. For the Group, to the extent that the 
derivatives are designated and effective as net investment hedges, they are transferred to equity on consolidation to match against foreign 
exchange exposure in the related assets and liabilities. 
The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain transactional exposures. Gains and losses on these derivatives are 
recognised immediately in the Income Statement.

you to receive them more quickly and securely. It also allows the 
Company to communicate in a more environmentally friendly and 
cost-effective manner. To register for this service, you should go to 
www.shareview.co.uk.
Payment of dividends to UK resident 
shareholders
Shareholders whose dividends are currently sent to their registered 
address may wish to consider having their dividends paid directly into 
their personal bank or building society account. This has a number of 
advantages, including the crediting of cleared funds on the actual 
dividend payment date. If you would like your future dividends paid in 
this way, you should contact the Registrar or complete a mandate 
instruction available at www.shareview.co.uk and return it to the 
Registrar. Under this arrangement, dividend confirmations are still 
sent to your registered address.
Payment of dividends to non-UK resident 
shareholders
Instead of waiting for a sterling cheque to arrive by post, shareholders 
can request that their dividends be paid directly to a personal bank 
account overseas. This is a service which the Registrar can arrange in 
over 30 different countries worldwide, and in local currencies, and it 
normally costs less than paying in a sterling cheque. For more 
information, you should contact the Registrar on +44 (0)121 415 7049 
or download an application form online at www.shareview.co.uk. 
Alternatively, you can contact the Registrar at the address given 
above.
Annual Dividend Confirmation
The Company issues Annual Dividend Confirmations (“ADC”) to 
private shareholders. An ADC in respect of dividends paid by the 
Company during the tax year 2017/18 has been issued at the same 
time as this report.

Share fraud warning!
Share fraud includes scams where investors receive unsolicited calls 
or correspondence concerning investment matters from organisations 
or persons claiming or implying that they have some connection with 
the Company. These are typically from purported ‘brokers’ who offer 
to buy shares at a price often far in excess of their market value. 
These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any offers of unsolicited 
advice, discounted shares, premium prices for shares they own or 
free reports into the Company. If you receive any such unsolicited 
calls, correspondence or investment advice:
 – ensure you get the correct name of the person and firm
 – check that the firm is on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
Register to ensure they are authorised at www.register.fsa.org.uk
 – use the details on the FCA Register to contact the firm
 – call the FCA Consumer Helpline (0800 111 6768) if there are no 
contact details in the Register or you are told they are out of date
 – if you feel uncomfortable with the call or the calls persist, simply 
hang up
 – if you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should 
contact ActionFraud on 0300 123 2040.
REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

Cautionary statement
This Annual Report and National Express’s website may contain 
certain ‘forward-looking statements’ with respect to National Express 
Group PLC (‘Company’ or ‘Group’) and the Group’s financial 
condition, results of its operations and business, and certain plans, 
strategy, objectives, goals and expectations with respect to these 
items and the economies and markets in which the Group operates.
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified 
by their use of a date in the future or such words as ‘anticipates’, 
‘aims’, ‘due’, ‘could’, ‘may’, ‘should’, ‘will’, ‘would’, ‘expects’, ‘believes’, 
‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘targets’, ‘goal’ or ‘estimates’ or, in each case, their 
negative or other variations or comparable terminology. Forward-
looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. By their 
very nature, forward-looking statements are inherently unpredictable, 
speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to 
events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. 
Many of these assumptions, risks and uncertainties relate to factors 
that are beyond the Group’s ability to control or estimate precisely. 
There are a number of such factors that could cause actual results 
and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied 
by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are 
not limited to, changes in the political conditions, economies and 
markets in which the Group operates (including the outcome of the 
negotiations to leave the EU); changes in the legal, regulatory and 
competition frameworks in which the Group operates; changes in  
the markets from which the Group raises finance; the impact of legal 
or other proceedings against or which affect the Group; changes in 
accounting practices and interpretation of accounting standards 
under IFRS, and changes in interest and exchange rates.
Any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report or 
National Express’s website, or made subsequently, which are 
attributable to the Company or any other member of the Group, or 
persons acting on their behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety 
by the factors referred to above. Each forward-looking statement 
speaks only as of the date it is made. Except as required by its legal 
or statutory obligations, the Company does not intend to update any 
forward-looking statements.
Nothing in this Annual Report or National Express’s website should 
be construed as a profit forecast or an invitation to deal in the 
securities of the Company.
