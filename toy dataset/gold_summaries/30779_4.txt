 Driving our business forward through our three strategic priorities
Delivering operational  
excellence
Deployment  
of technology
Growing our business through acquisitions 
and market diversification
Definition
We aim to be the safest, most reliable, convenient and best 
value transport provider in the modes we operate
We utilise technology to raise customer and safety 
standards, drive efficiencies in our business and  
facilitate growth
We continue to look to grow our unique portfolio of 
international bus, coach and rail businesses through 
selective bolt-on acquisitions and diversification into 
complementary markets
Performance
 – All eligible businesses, ALSA and our UK bus and coach operations,  
now have EFQM* five-star ratings
 – Both our UK bus and coach operations re-awarded the prestigious  
British Safety Council Sword of Honour
 – Improved customer satisfaction in our UK businesses and in ALSA
 – 19% underlying improvement in FWI index**
 – Strong retention rate of 96% in our North America school bus business
 – Another record year for passenger numbers at ALSA
 – Launched World Class Maintenance and safety initiatives across each  
of our businesses
 – New mobile websites and ticketing apps are driving higher online 
transactions, conversion rates and lowering costs – eg ALSA has  
seen a 10% increase in sales through digital channels
 – Contactless pay launched across the UK business, providing faster,  
more convenient methods of payment
 – Our real-time revenue management systems in ALSA and our UK coach 
operations are growing revenue through both improved yield and 
passenger growth
 – Lytx DriveCam technology is now fully implemented in our UK bus  
and coach operations and North America transit, delivering a reduction  
in the number of collisions and associated costs
 – We have acquired nine bolt-on acquisitions in the year:
 – three in North America: the significant acquisition of a Chicago 
paratransit operator, securing entry into the second largest paratransit 
market in North America; and the acquisition of two school bus and 
charter businesses in Cincinatti and Rochester, New York
 – six in ALSA: two urban transport companies in Madrid and Granada; 
three businesses in the Geneva area including two additional 
businesses in the Swiss ski transfer market; and a charter transport 
services company in Madrid
Future outlook
 – Target further passenger growth in the ALSA and our UK bus and coach 
operations through our digital initiatives
 – Launch new products and services including new routes, new express 
and charter services and new ticketing options
 – We will continue to leverage our customer reputation to win new business 
in North America
 – Delivering Excellence programme will continue to embed best practices 
across the Group including world class safety performance
 – Continue implementation of our World Class Driver programmes across 
each of our businesses, raising driving and safety standards further
 – Further optimisation and automation of our RMS systems in Spain and our 
UK coach operations to drive growth in revenue, profit and incremental 
demand, as well as higher fleet utilisation
 – Further roll-out of Lytx DriveCam across our ALSA and North America 
school bus businesses, strengthening driver standards and  
reducing collisions
 – Enhanced CRM systems driving greater customer insight, to deliver 
greater personalisation and improved service
 – Further enhancements to websites, apps and ticketless payment systems, 
helping to drive revenue and reduce costs
 – Technology to support our World Class Driver programmes such as driver 
fatigue detection
 – Further selective bolt-on acquisitions principally in North America and 
Spain where we can extend our offering into new regional markets and 
cities or build further scale in existing markets and cities, also enabling us 
to drive incremental revenue and profit through the provision of additional 
commercial services such as charter services, while also making greater 
use of our fleet
 – We see a strong pipeline of future opportunities, both in bidding and in 
M&A, as the liberalisation agenda continues across the world
 – We will seek investments in assets that present a platform for future 
growth, and will consider JV arrangements with the right partners
Measuring our  
progress
We believe passenger growth and improvements in safety standards through 
a reduction in safety-related incidents are key indicators of whether we are 
driving high safety and service standards and which will ultimately help 
deliver further growth in revenue, cash and profit.
A rising proportion of sales transacted through our digital channels 
demonstrates that our customers value more convenient and faster ways to 
pay. At the same time, the transfer of transactions away from traditional ticket 
offices and third party sales agents to digital channels is driving operational 
efficiencies and reducing costs.
We maintain a disciplined approach to investing and target project returns 
well above our cost of capital, typically targeting returns of 15% or above. 
Across the business as a whole, disciplined allocation of capital is measured 
through a focus on ROCE, a key element of executive remuneration.
