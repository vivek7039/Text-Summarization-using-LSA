 Our strategy is  
delivering results
National Express has delivered perhaps 
its strongest ever set of results in 2017, 
with good growth across all of our 
internationally diversified portfolio. 
Dean Finch 
Group Chief Executive
Introduction
National Express has delivered perhaps its strongest ever set of 
results in 2017, with good growth across all of our internationally 
diversified portfolio. We have achieved particularly strong 
performances in both North America and ALSA. Our performance  
in the second half of 2017 in the UK has reversed the declines seen  
in the first six months, to deliver annual growth in both our bus and 
coach businesses.
I believe that we are seeing the benefit of our focus on operational 
excellence, technology investment and disciplined acquisition in  
these results. North America’s combination of customer focus, 
contract retention and successful acquisitions has driven a record 
result. ALSA has also delivered a very strong performance, propelled  
by its increasingly sophisticated real time Revenue Management 
System (RMS). Both our UK bus and coach businesses have  
used sophisticated pricing techniques and efficiency programmes  
to drive second half performances that have more than reversed  
their first half challenges.
These divisional performances are reflected in the strength of  
our Group results. We again delivered a record statutory profit of 
£134.3 million (up nearly 12% on last year’s record). Free cash flow 
also increased to £146.4 million (2016: £138.6m) and our gearing 
reduced to 2.3 times EBITDA. With this strong performance we  
are proposing a 10% increase in the final dividend. Our consistent 
delivery is also reflected in the fact that over the last five years we 
have generated over £750 million of free cash flow and, including  
this year’s proposed final dividend, returned over £325 million  
to shareholders.
While I am pleased our international portfolio and strategic focuses 
have driven another year of growth, I am firmly focused on the future. 
We have significant opportunities still to capture to drive organic 
growth as well as new avenues for further expansion emerging.
With the Group out of UK rail we have removed both significant 
financial commitments and political distraction and are able to 
concentrate on growing our bus and coach presence in our existing, 
interesting adjacent and targeted new, markets.
We have moved deliberately away from a business model where our 
prosperity was significantly determined by the instabilities of UK rail. 
Indeed, a key attraction of our internationally diversified portfolio is 
that it has a significantly reduced exposure to any one country’s 
political or regulatory movement.
Our largest contract is worth less than four percent of our Group 
earnings; we are less dependent on the success or failure of a 
specific contract. So, rather than spending tens of millions of pounds 
on rail bids where we may win, say, one in four competitions – which 
were also won on increasingly eye-watering terms, with vanishingly 
thin returns – we have decided to invest our strengthening resources 
on improving the quality, safety and efficiency of our operations as 
well as on attractive acquisition opportunities. We have expanded in 
and into large, wealthy cities and also launched successfully in three 
new markets (Germany, Bahrain and Switzerland) in recent years. 
These three new market entries have all been profitable in their first 
full year of operations.
Our strategy therefore remains focused on three key pillars:
 – Operational excellence, including organic growth, tight cost control, 
rigorous cash flow management and the disciplined allocation of 
capital to maximise returns;
 – Investment in technology to drive customer-focused innovation  
and excellence, improved safety performance and greater cost 
efficiency; and,
 – Growth through targeted acquisitions in the world’s most affluent 
cities and regions.
I will now set out how we are already delivering against each of these 
pillars and outline some of the emerging opportunities for further 
benefits to come.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 14 Chief Executive’s review We also continue to forge and leverage strong partnerships with  
local authorities to tackle key operational and customer service 
challenges. For example, through a joint bid with Transport for  
West Midlands, our bus business has recently secured Department 
for Transport investment for new bus lanes on the important Harborne  
to Birmingham city centre route. We have introduced our state-of-the-
art Platinum buses to this route, with the aspiration of repeating the 
significant increases in passengers we have seen where previous 
schemes (such as Lode Lane in Solihull) have combined journey  
time savings with new, premium vehicles. It is precisely this strong 
partnership approach that we are looking to further enhance by 
working closely together to make sure the 2022 Commonwealth 
Games in Birmingham are a success and deliver significant  
transport improvements before the games begin.
Investment in technology
We are in a period of significant technological change. The seemingly 
constant stream of innovations presents many opportunities for 
customer-focused businesses such as ours. We are working on 
innovative new transport technologies, with ALSA developing 
autonomous, electric vehicle projects in Madrid, for example.  
Beyond this, our task is to focus on the improved outcomes that  
can be delivered through the right technologies, rather than chasing 
every innovation that appears on the market. I believe new technology 
presents a real opportunity to drive organic growth, improve standards 
and realise cost efficiencies. We have therefore focused our interest  
in three principal areas.
First, improving our service to customers. Our RMS is a significant 
example of this. This allows us to provide real-time pricing that 
becomes increasingly sophisticated through time as it builds up a 
‘memory’ of historic customer behaviour and applies it to the current 
market. This has allowed our UK coach services to respond to the 
reduction in travel demand after the terrorist attacks in 2017, with  
a prompt, targeted lowering of ticket prices to sustain passenger 
numbers. That our UK coach business carried more passengers  
in 2017 than 2016, despite the significant challenges it faced, is 
testament to the benefit of this real-time and granular pricing.  
Overall, our UK coach services saw an underlying revenue benefit  
of two percent from RMS, with seat occupancy rates also up two 
percent – also demonstrating the efficiency benefit of the technology. 
Our Spanish long haul services which have RMS installed also saw 
revenue increase by 3.9% and seat occupancy rates up over  
two percent.
Strategy
Operational Excellence
We aim to give our customers safe, punctual and frequent transport 
services at excellent prices. During 2017, we gave our customers 
lower fares and improved services. We also invested to improve the 
safety of our services and their ease of use through enhancements 
including the provision of better real time information, mobile journey 
planning tools, contactless ticketing and faster services with better 
end to end connections.
This relentless focus on improving our service to customers and  
our fares, coupled with constantly improving the efficiency of  
our operations, was rewarded with an increase in the number of 
passengers we carried and with improving customer satisfaction. 
Across the Group we have carried over 882 million passengers, up 
1.2% on a continuing basis, on 2016. Our value for money scores 
were already high and are rising, for example: UK coach’s score  
was over 87%, up 0.5% year-on-year; and, ALSA’s 72% was up  
6% year-on-year.
Our businesses have again demonstrated their industry-leading 
customer service credentials in the year. ALSA has achieved a  
record customer satisfaction score of 7.4 out of 10 (up 4.8% 
year-on-year) and also won the IZO ‘Best Customer Experience  
for the Transport Industry’ award, the largest satisfaction survey 
conducted in Spain. Our UK bus business achieved a record-
equalling customer satisfaction score of 87% in the independent 
Transport Focus survey (also up 1% year-on-year). Our UK coach 
business’ customer satisfaction score was also up, three percent to 
86%, with the independent Temkin Group Net Promoter Score index 
ranking National Express fourth in its select group of companies. 
North America again delivered another year of customer satisfaction 
above 90%, coming in at 91.2%.
We are also seeing the benefits in the safety performances of our 
business. Safety is our top priority and we established our Driving  
Out Harm programme in 2010 with the deliberately ambitious 
objective of removing all harm caused by our businesses. I am 
delighted that since Driving Out Harm’s inception, we have reduced 
harm, as measured by our industry-leading Fatalities and Weighted 
Injuries (FWI) index, by 74% per million miles operated.
We are also receiving significant external recognition for our safety 
programmes and performance. Both UK bus and coach received 
five-star British Safety Council scores, and their highest honour,  
the Sword of Honour: bus’ score of 97.4% was the highest in the 
transport industry; coach also received a ROSPA Gold Award. ALSA 
received two awards from MAPFE: the ‘International Road Safety’  
and ‘Best Initiative in the Prevention of Accidents’ awards. And our 
North American school bus business has again received the highest 
possible safety rating from the Federal Motor Carrier Administration. 
Safety will remain our Group’s – and my personal – top priority as 
long as I am Chief Executive. I will say more about our technology 
investments that are a crucial part of our plan for further improvement 
in the next section.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 15 Chief Executive’s review Investing in technology to  
improve safety standards
We are committed to investing in technology to improve 
standards and secure efficiencies. One area where we have 
shown particular leadership is through the installation and use  
of smart safety cameras on our vehicles. Lytx DriveCam, 
pictured below, is an industry-leading system that allows the 
recording of accidents or incidents worthy of subsequent review. 
This technology is being rolled out across our businesses and is 
already fully installed in the UK. The videos allow us to improve 
safety and driving standards through tailored training and also 
provide crucial evidence for insurance claims, helping us 
significantly reduce the costs of accidents where it is installed. 
New technology presents a real 
opportunity to drive organic growth, 
improve standards and realise  
cost efficiencies. 
In 2018, we expect RMS to underpin further organic growth and 
deliver a one percent underlying benefit in both UK coach and ALSA. 
We also continue to see significant growth in digital sales channels 
across our businesses. It is by far the most significant means of 
payment for UK coach, with 66% of revenue coming through digital 
channels (up 3% year-on-year). ALSA saw significant growth in digital 
channels in 2017 of over 9%, with more than 40% of all its sales now 
through digital. On ALSA’s long haul coach services, 44% of all sales 
are through digital channels. UK bus is also experiencing a rapid rise 
in the number of passengers using digital channels, with 10% of all 
passengers now travelling on m-tickets. This growth in m-ticket use 
has almost entirely occurred during 2017 and this trend is 
accelerating in 2018.
We are investing to accelerate this shift. We have introduced new 
contactless ticket machines to our UK buses, allowing a wide range  
of digital and contactless ticket types to be used. These machines 
enable the daily capping of prices and allow us to move decisively 
away from the use of exact cash fares to travel. Our customers in 
Coventry started using these new machines in January and they  
will be fully operational across the whole of the West Midlands in  
April, making it the single largest contactless network outside of 
London. We will be complementing this with the launch of a much-
improved app in March that will allow real-time tracking of buses, 
among other customer-friendly features.
We have also invested to make UK coach’s digital presence easier, 
quicker and more responsive to use. An upgrade to our UK coach 
website has significantly reduced the number of clicks necessary  
(and therefore time taken) to purchase a ticket, with online sales 
conversion rates increasing 3% during the year. We have also  
piloted a successful seat reservation system which will be rolled  
out network-wide in 2018. These innovations and investments  
have: helped raise its rating in the App Store to 4.5 stars (up from  
2.5 stars at the start of 2017); seen www.nationalexpressgroup.com 
significantly improve its Google search optimisation scores so it is 
now the best ranked land transport website in the UK; and also been 
recognised with the Best Technology Award at the UK Coach Awards 
for the customer entertainment system, VUER.
Our North America business is also accelerating its use of technology 
to make it more responsive to customer demands. During 2017  
we launched new apps in transit and school bus, and through  
our market-leading software company Ecolane, for paratransit 
customers. The Ecolane app allows users to book and view trips in 
real time and also proactively alerts them when their vehicle is on its 
way. We have also – uniquely within the industry – installed an online 
complaints management system in all of our school bus depots.
Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 16 Chief Executive’s review German Rail and Bahrain continue to use market-leading 
technologies to enhance their services to customers. In Germany,  
our ‘NX-Scout’ WhatsApp group, which provides up-to-date travel 
information for customers, has the equivalent of around 15% of  
daily passengers signed up. In Bahrain, the local app has seen  
a 50% increase in downloads during 2017, and the ‘GO Card’ 
smartcard is used in between 45% and 50% of journeys.
The second area where technology is also playing a very important 
role in our determination to continue to improve our performance  
is safety. In 2017, we saw significant progress in our roll-out of the 
industry-leading Lytx DriveCam smart safety cameras that allow 
incidents to be recorded and analysed. This provides the opportunity 
for both tailored driver training and fuller evidence to be used in 
insurance claims. The cameras are now installed: across all our  
UK fleet; in 6,351 vehicles in North America, with a target of around 
another 10,000 by the end of the year; and in 150 vehicles in ALSA, 
with a target of over 1,000 (around 45% of the Spanish fleet) by the 
end of the year.
There are very encouraging results of reductions in ‘event severity’, 
the number of incidents and insurance costs where the smart  
safety cameras have been in place the longest. In North America,  
for example, we started rolling Lytx DriveCam out in 2014 and it  
is now installed in 46 locations. The results so far show that when 
comparing the costs of claims from preventable street accidents  
for the 12 months prior to fitment against post-installation, there  
has been a 30% reduction. So with the significant further roll out 
programme in 2018, we expect to reap further driving standards, 
safety and cost benefits over the coming years.
Alongside the investment in the smart safety cameras we have begun 
a comprehensive programme addressing speed management across 
the Group. Technology is already playing a crucial role in identifying 
issues and allowing targeted management interventions. It will be 
augmented in 2018 with a comprehensive internal communications 
campaign to reinforce the crucial importance of speed management. 
We will have the near universal roll-out of this technology by the end 
of 2018.
We are also investing in technology which improves our third principal 
area: business and cost efficiency. Two North American pilots are 
providing particularly interesting opportunities. First, a new budget 
management system which provides, to a very granular level, detailed 
cost management for local management use but also central review. 
Second, a business management system will systematise good 
customer and operational practice across our business supporting 
local management and also enhancing central oversight. In a 
continent-wide business where customer relationships are key, 
striking the right balance between local flexibility and central control  
is a crucial challenge for running an effective and efficient business.
These two emerging tools are providing encouraging early results  
and exciting opportunities for the future. By using the business 
management system we have been able to revise our fleet 
management system and in so doing have identified over 750 buses 
we believe can be more effectively deployed in 2018. This will have 
direct benefits in terms of a significant reduction in new capital 
requirements. This system is being extended to cover our 
maintenance processes and we expect to again generate improved 
efficiency in our systems generally and also allow for greater claims 
on parts warranties, specifically.
Acquisitions and new opportunities
With our strong and sustainable cash flows, we have targeted new 
acquisitions in recent years to deliver growth as well as add quality 
new businesses to our portfolio. In 2017, we continued to do this  
in a disciplined manner, with targeted returns above 15%. We made  
a further nine acquisitions in the year, with North America remaining 
the focus of our capital allocation, but ALSA also adding six  
new businesses.
The acquisitions we made in recent years continue to perform 
strongly and we have a strong pipeline of further opportunities that  
we are actively pursuing in both North America and through ALSA. 
Through the appointment of James Stamp as Group Commercial 
Director – previously KPMG’s UK Head of Transport and Global  
Head of Aviation – and other hires in his team, we have strengthened 
our Group support to the divisions in their acquisition and new  
market identification.
Our ALSA acquisitions include three that build on our successful 
Swiss ski market entry through AlpyBus and strengthen our presence 
in the Geneva area. We are developing Geneva as an emerging 
growth ‘hub’ with expansion into local school bus and discretionary 
transport alongside the growing transfer business; AlpyBus itself  
grew significantly in 2017. ALSA made another three acquisitions in 
the year that add new bus operations in Madrid and Granada as well 
as ‘Maitours’, which provides: staff transfers for a large local airline 
and national bank headquarters; an urban transport contract in 
Azuqueca, Guadalajara; and school bus services in Madrid. 
We made three acquisitions in North America during 2017,  
adding over 800 vehicles across the school bus, paratransit,  
transit and special education sectors. These acquisitions included 
Cook-DuPage Transportation, providing entry into the US’s largest 
paratransit market (Chicago). Paratransit is a fast-growing market  
and this acquisition therefore strengthens our credentials in this 
important sector.
By using our presence – helped by recent acquisitions – in large city 
markets to operate services across, for example, school bus, transit, 
paratransit, charter and employee shuttle, we can offer competitive 
pricing and operational resilience as we benefit from the synergies 
between the different operations. With a greater local concentration 
we can also develop strong local relationships. Across the Group, our 
best markets are often those where we successfully combine service 
excellence, competitive pricing and strong relationships. We believe, 
therefore, that developing and expanding this approach provides an 
interesting opportunity for new growth.
Our North American acquisitions have also brought new thinking  
into our business and we believe one area where we will benefit  
in particular is in charter. Learning from the way a recently acquired 
business had developed and grown its own local charter revenue,  
we see the opportunity for significant nationwide growth. We estimate 
the national charter market to be worth more than $1.5 billion a year. 
In 2017, for example, National Express only captured around three 
percent of this market, demonstrating the opportunity for growth.
We have continued to target new growth opportunities through 
selected bidding. ALSA has recently submitted a joint venture bid  
to operate a bus contract in Rabat, to consolidate our position in 
Morocco. We plan to submit further German rail bids this year to 
augment our presence in North Rhine Westphalia.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2017 17 Chief Executive’s review Recognising exceptional  
driving performance
Our People Value is to develop the talents, reward the 
exceptional performance and respect the rights of all our 
employees. Our Master and Advanced Driver programme is a 
prime example of this. If drivers have two consecutive years of 
excellent service and performance (including, for example, no 
preventable accidents or customer complaints and excellent 
driving assessments) they become an Advanced Driver. Three 
consecutive years of this exceptional performance achieves 
Master Driver status. These drivers are presented with their 
awards at a ceremony (that families are encouraged to attend) 
and receive a distinctive tie and free membership of the Institute 
for Advanced Motorists, providing potential insurance benefits. 
We now have 903 Advanced Drivers and 728 Master Drivers 
across the Group and this increasingly popular programme 
continues to grow.
Master Drivers receive a distinctive tie to recognise their achievement
I look forward to 2018 with both  
excitement and optimism. I am  
ably supported by a strong, dynamic 
management team that operates  
National Express’ many businesses  
with relentless focus and efficiency. 
I am very proud of our industry-leading work in the community. We 
launched the National Express Foundation in 2012 and in that time 
have supported over 14,200 youngsters in the West Midlands, East 
London, South Essex and Medway. This support has helped local 
community groups working with disadvantaged young people as  
well as those who would otherwise not be able to access further or 
higher education because of financial challenges, attend college or 
university. This year National Express Group will provide £300,000  
to the foundation to further its good work.
Equally, our leadership on the Living Wage has been a source of 
pride. Our UK bus operations have been a Living Wage Foundation 
accredited employer for 2 years and the feedback from staff has  
been very positive. Our UK coach business is currently securing the 
accreditation; it has introduced the Living Wage Foundation living 
wage to directly employed staff and will shortly roll this out to 
contractors’ employees.
I was very sad to hear of the untimely passing of John Devaney  
in January this year. John served as National Express’ Chairman 
between April 2009 and January 2013. John also served as  
Executive Chairman for a period during this time, including leading  
the challenging rights issue that rescued the business. John brought 
a wealth of experience to his time at National Express and I always 
found him a helpful source of both support and challenge, essential 
for any Chief Executive. Both personally, and on behalf of National 
Express, I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to John’s 
family and friends.
Outlook
We expect to deliver growth in every business again in 2018,  
as our strategy continues to generate strong shareholder value.
We will remain focused on operational excellence and technology 
investment to deliver high quality services to customers at good  
value prices. Our businesses are increasingly sophisticated, using 
technology to get ever closer to our customers and drive through 
efficiencies in our operations, whether RMS, Lytx DriveCam or 
contactless ticketing. We are confident therefore that we will deliver 
organic growth in each business in 2018 and complement this with  
a strong acquisition pipeline of opportunities with returns of at least 
15%, across ALSA and North America. We are actively working on 
further acquisitions.
Our strong and sustainable cash flow – we believe our free cash flow 
in 2018 will be broadly similar to 2017 – combined with £20 million of 
fuel cost savings and the benefit of acquisitions made at the end of 
2017, give us strong tailwinds. These have recently been strengthened 
by US tax reform, which will see our Group effective tax rate reduced 
to the low 20s, in percentage points.
I look forward to 2018 with both excitement and optimism. I am ably 
supported by a strong, dynamic management team that operates 
National Express’ many businesses with relentless focus and 
efficiency. The technological tools now available to the business  
give us the granularity and transparency to control and manage the 
business in a way that I think could be transformational over time.  
The strength and resilience of the business proved to be very 
impressive in 2017 and will continue to underpin our future in  
the years to come. Our strong cash generation coupled with our 
numerous growth opportunities give me confidence as we once  
again look ahead to deliver growth in revenue, profits and returns  
in the years ahead.
