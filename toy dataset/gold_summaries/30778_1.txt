Chief Executive  
Officer’s statement
Trading
Sales in 2017 grew by 9% to £957.8m 
(2016: £882.4m). A change in the sales  
mix between the two divisions, with 
Recruitment accounting for 88% of 
the 2017 revenue (2016: 84%), has had 
a comparative impact on the Group’s 
gross profit margin, with a reduction 
from 14.2% in 2016 to 11.9% in 2017 . 
Underlying profit before tax* reduced 
by 1% to £36.3m (2016: £36.7m). On 
this basis, adjusted diluted earnings 
per share fell to 112.6p (2016: 114.0p), a 
reduction of 1%. However, reported profit 
before tax from continuing operations 
increased by 28% to £24.1m (2016: 
£18.9m) and reported diluted earnings 
per share from continuing operations 
rose by 21% to 71.1p (2016: 58.8p).
*  Underlying profit before tax excludes 
amortisation charges from intangible assets 
arising on business combinations, acquisition 
and exceptional re-organisation costs, and the 
non-cash charge/credit for share based 
payment costs (“SBPC”)

Recruitment
Recruitment sales rose by 14%, 
to £843.3m (2016: £740.8m), 
driven both by organic growth 
of 9.5% and by the acquisitions 
of Driver and Labour Recruit 
Limited (trading as “Oak 
Recruitment”) in the Republic of 
Ireland and Brightwork Limited 
(“Brightwork”) in Scotland in the 
first half of 2017 . All our OnSite 
divisions saw good organic 
growth in the year. 
Our Recruitment gross profit margin, 
expressed as a percentage of sales, 
decreased by half a percent from 8.3% to 
7.8% – more than half of which was due 
to an increase in the minimum wage. A 
more meaningful metric is the cash margin 
per hour which rose in the year by +1.2%. 
The increase in margin per hour reflects 
the increased scale and diversity of our 
customer base. The above factors resulted in 
gross margin increasing by 7.8% from £61.3m 
to £66.1m. During the year, we invested 
heavily within Recruitment, specifically 
on IT infrastructure and new senior talent, 
which saw overheads rise by 7.9%, the net 
result of which is that underlying operating 
profit, before finance charges, increased 
by 7.4%, to £20.2m (2016: £18.8m). 
We continue to generate significant 
opportunities for the Group to build market 
share in our core business, underpinned 
by our rigid adherence to compliance, 
ethical approach and ability to deliver to 
our customers. Customers are increasingly 
looking for suppliers with scale and added 
value products, such as worker retention 
models, apprenticeships and bespoke 
training. This has meant that we have 
continued to win new business in line with 
prior year levels of growth. The number of 
OnSite locations from which we operate 
grew by net 38, ending the period with 
a total of 395 locations. 14 of those wins 
were within our core OnSite divisions, 
with 17 in our newer divisions (Agriculture, 
Driving, Ireland) and seven acquired 
with Brightwork. This demonstrates that 
Staffline’s geographical and operational 
scale means we remain the go-to 
supplier across most industry sectors. 
The ongoing uncertainty around the final 
Brexit outcome has had an impact on UK 
consumer spend, specifically within the 
fashion and food sectors. This has made 
supermarket and high-street store demand 
volatile. As a result, our growth in these 
areas has slowed down. This has meant 
that our 10% organic growth has been 
achieved through new customers in both 
the core and newer divisions. For example, 
our largest single-site customer (by volume) 
was a brand new Staffline customer in 2016, 
where our business has continued to grow 
in 2017 due to our excellent service levels. 
The uncertainty around the final Brexit 
outcome has also seen a reduction in the 
number of EU citizens coming to the UK 
and an increase in those returning to their 
homelands. In addition, UK unemployment 
rates at 42-year lows have impacted on 
our ability to attract candidates. However, 
our scale of operations, our excellence in 
both candidate attraction and retention 
and our ability to offer additional training 
through PeoplePlus have meant that we 
have been able to mitigate any temporary 
shortfalls in available candidates. 
As we face the challenges of a tightening 
labour market and the competition for 
talent intensifies, we are placing even 
greater emphasis on the job seeker 
experience. Customer experience and 
employee engagement are at the heart 
of our business model, and job seekers 
are increasingly choosing Staffline due 
to the emphasis we place on using our 
scale for good. By using our vast network 
and resources to provide fast, flexible and 
long-term employment across thousands of 
roles, we offer applicants unprecedented 
choice and variety of work assignments 
as we introduce thousands of job seekers 
to the most suitable employers via simple 
and easy to use applications. We have 
invested in a digital transformation 
programme which reflects changes in 
job seeker behaviour with emphasis 
on search engine optimisation, and we 
anticipate a considerable return on this 
investment during 2018, by way of increased 
applications and brand awareness from 
both active and passive job seekers.

PeoplePlus
PeoplePlus revenues decreased 
by 19% to £114.5m (2016: 
£141.6m) in 2017 . This has been 
driven by the much-publicised 
start of the wind down of the 
Work Programme following the 
end of referrals in March 2017 . 
Gross profit reduced by £15.9m to £47.7m 
(2016: £63.6m), with the gross profit 
margin falling from 45% to 42%. We have 
successfully managed overhead costs, 
saving £13.6m year on year. This has mostly 
offset the fall in revenues, with operating 
profit, before finance charges, only reducing 
by £2.3m (11%) from 2016, improving the 
operating margin to 16.5% (2016: 15.0%).
PeoplePlus is built on three key  
themes of helping people to:
• Transform lives – through our work in  
justice services and adult social care
• Get jobs and keep jobs – through our work 
with youth employment programmes, 
employability programmes across the UK, 
including helping people set up their own 
businesses
• Develop careers – through our work in 
Apprenticeships and Adult Education
On the Work Programme, following the end 
of referrals in March 2017, we have focused 
on effective and efficient operational 
delivery to counter the revenue decline 
through to March 2021. Our focus on 
delivery has resulted in our nine contracts 
being in the top ten performers nationally, 
a further improvement on the prior year’s 
strong performance. The revenue reduction 
was forecast, and this allowed us to make 
significant savings in overheads through 
changes in our operating model. This has 
allowed us to maintain strong profitability 
in the Work Programme during 2017, 
which we expect to continue in 2018.
The Apprenticeship Levy, introduced 
in April 2017, has created a huge new 
market for apprenticeship delivery. 
Whilst the overall market growth in 
apprenticeship numbers is significantly 
below government expectations, we 
feel that this market still represents an 
excellent growth opportunity, and we 
have aligned ourselves accordingly. 
Our strong offering has seen us sign a 
number of new contracts in 2017, and we 
are continuing to build a strong pipeline 
into 2018. These existing clients will 
provide organic year-on-year growth. 
This, coupled with expected new wins in 
2018, will allow us to take advantage of 
a growing market, estimated to be worth 
£3bn per annum. We also believe this will 
create a good foothold for us into the 
private sector market overall, where we 
want to develop new market propositions.
The Adult Education division was given 
a 2 rating (“Good”) by Ofsted during 
2017, a clear reflection of the very high 
quality of our training provision. Business 
performance has been strong, with 
growth in existing contracts following 
the government re-tender and our ability 
to deliver against these remains high 
positioning us well for further growth. We 
were awarded over £10m of new Adult 
Education Budget funding during the year.
Our Independent Living Services (“ILS”) 
and Carers Hubs have continued to 
perform well, with ILS managing £40m 
of direct payments from councils on 
behalf of local care recipients; enabling 
them to live more independently. With 
demand on adult social care growing 
and representing a challenging budget 
area for local authorities, we continue 
to seek opportunities to further 
develop our services in this area.
Our focus on new business has allowed 
us to secure £54m (2016: £13m) of new 
business in 2017, with an improved win 
rate of 1 in 3 (2016: 1 in 6). This includes 
£24m for Fair Start Scotland, the 
Scottish Government’s key employability 
programme, which commences in April 
2018, and New Enterprise Allowance 
2 at £9m, which supports individuals 
wishing to start in self-employment.

ISO 9001, ISO 27001 and  
Investors in People (“IIP”) accreditations
Our organisation has grown significantly 
over the last decade, both organically 
and through acquisition. To ensure that 
we maintain control over our processes, 
we have renewed our accreditations 
to both ISO 9001, accreditation for our 
management systems, and Investors in 
People (“IIP” – Recruitment division), to 
ensure that we continue to motivate and 
develop our staff. The PeoplePlus business 
has achieved ISO 27001 “Cyber Essentials 
Plus” accreditation during the year for the 
security of its IT systems, which represents 
an important certification given that we 
deal with the personal details of many 
hundreds of thousands of people. 
People
Our focus on driving a high-performance 
culture continues and, as we see our talent 
pipeline develop, the Group continues to 
review succession planning at all levels to 
support our agility and to enable further 
growth. As a commercially focused business, 
we regularly review our headcount to ensure 
that our lean operating model is fit for 
purpose. The consolidation of headcount 
across the business at 31 December 2017, 
shows a permanent workforce total of 
2,265 people (full-time equivalents), a net 
reduction of 220 compared to 2,485 as at 
31 December 2016 (movement includes an 
increase of 80, relating to acquisitions in 
Scotland and the Republic of Ireland during 
the year). Average monthly headcount 
has fallen by a net 16% during the year, 
from 2,793 in 2016 to 2,357 in 2017. 
Developing our people is key to us as 
an organisation and we have many 
ways of encouraging this. Our ethos 
supports nurturing talent within the 
business at all levels and encourages 
self-development, which in turn aids 
succession planning, supporting the 
strategic growth of the Group. We continue 
to place great emphasis on the training 
and development of our people, and we 
review our training needs on an ongoing 
basis in line with our vision, values and 
ambition to be an employer of choice.
Our first Peak Performance Camp 
was held with senior leaders across 
the business in February 2017. This 
has resulted in some strategic projects 
taking place to explore more business 
opportunities for growth. A master class 
event was held in our PeoplePlus business 
during November 2017 to enhance 
the understanding and knowledge of 
our senior managers in growing their 
individual business areas. Our next annual 
Leadership Camp for our leaders of the 
future will take place in February 2018.
 
As the Apprenticeship Levy came into force 
this year, Recruitment and PeoplePlus 
divisions have worked collaboratively to 
develop our programme, with our first 
60 delegates embarking on a three-day 
residential at Nottingham University to start 
off on their apprenticeship programmes 
in June 2017. 24 new delegates joined 
the programme in November 2017 with 
a further 40 planned for January 2018. 
These apprenticeships are aimed at 
our first line managers, enhancing 
their skills and capability to be the best 
they can be, delivering results through 
others, learning more about business 
improvement techniques and customer 
excellence. A Level 5 management 
development programme is also planned 
for 12 delegates in early 2018 to support 
our current “high potential” managers 
grow to become leaders of the future.
Our Community Rehabilitation Company 
(“CRC”) contract continues to perform 
well against its contractual targets, and is 
evolving in line with HMIP recommendations 
and contractual changes being introduced 
by the Ministry of Justice. The Offender 
Learning and Skills Services ("OLASS") 
contract has seen us draw down the 
maximum revenue available against a 
challenging environment, and reflects 
the quality of our delivery and strong 
relationships with prison service leadership. 
This high level of performance will put us 
in a strong position for the next iteration 
of these contracts, which are a strategic 
priority for us as we look to grow in the 
offender learning and skills market.
PeoplePlus Northern Ireland has successfully 
tendered for, and been awarded, European 
Social Funding. This project will further 
develop our skills and employability offering 
across the province. Existing programmes 
in Employability, Community and Justice 
sectors continue to perform at projected 
levels. Our Apprenticeship Northern Ireland 
provision is realising growth, with several 
national branded businesses committing 
to work in sole partnership to upskill their 
workforces across Northern Ireland. There 
is a strong pipeline of new opportunities for 
further growth in the apprentice market. 
PeoplePlus Wales performed strongly 
throughout 2017, exceeding our 
expectations in all areas, including Youth 
Programmes, and expects to be confirmed 
as the top performing provider in Wales 
when government learner outcome 
reports are published. This positions 
PeoplePlus Wales well for the 2018 round 
of tendering by the Welsh Government 
of youth and adult programmes. 14

Gender Pay Gap Reporting (“GPGR”)
Our April 2017 GPGR review has almost 
been completed and we are aiming to

Health, safety and environment 
Staffline continues to take a proactive 
approach to the health, safety and 
welfare of its employees and contractors. 
Our commitment to health and safety 
is strong, and is demonstrated by the 
regular reviews taking place by senior 
management; the outcomes of which 
are cascaded across the business. 
Staffline actively monitors all aspects 
of health and safety using “closed loop 
management processes”. This allows all 
areas to be identified and documented 
during the audit process and shows 
continual development against all 
health and safety action plans, with 
senior management involvement 
throughout. The Group’s health and 
safety management systems are reviewed 
annually to ensure they remain aligned 
to the needs of the business, and allow 
the Group to know and demonstrate 
that our corporate responsibilities are 
being appropriately discharged.
Compliance
We take compliance with legislation and 
industry standards extremely seriously. We 
offer a total commitment to all our clients, 
ensuring that all our workers, whether or 
not they are working in areas covered by 
the legislation, are recruited and supplied to 
the standards required by the Gangmasters 
and Labour Abuse Authority (“GLAA”). Our 
commitment gives our clients the assurance 
that all UK ethical and legal standards 
are met in full at all times. We operate a 
confidential helpline for our workers to 
report any concerns and conduct regular 
surveys to ensure we are achieving our 
own high standards. We are a business 
partner, active member and supporter of the 
“Stronger Together” initiative to help prevent 
exploitation and trafficking of workers. We 
actively work with our clients to encourage 
strong partnerships with the authorities 
to collaborate to help reduce the risk of 
modern slavery in our supply chains. We 
are also actively engaged with anti-slavery 
networks to collaborate to help reduce 
modern slavery taking place in the UK. 
General Data Protection Regulation 
(“GDPR”) 
Staffline will comply with applicable 
GDPR regulations when they take effect in 
2018, including as a data processor, while 
also working closely with our providers 
of finance, customers and partners to 
meet contractual obligations for our 
procedures, products and services. 
Our governance measures will be 
comprehensive but proportionate, with 
the aim of minimising the risk of breaches 
and to uphold the protection of personal 
data. Our Data Protection Officer 
will inform and monitor compliance, 
and the Company will implement 
tools as appropriate that support the 
process, provide necessary security 
and ongoing delivery of objectives. 
Work is currently underway to build 
transition plans for all our systems and 
processes to ensure that the changes 
are managed effectively and without 
causing interruption to our normal 
business routines. Internal awareness 
campaigns and staff training activities 
will launch at the start of 2018.
Events after the balance sheet date
There were no events between the balance 
sheet date of 31 December 2017 and the 
approval of these accounts on 23 January 
2018 that are required to be bought to 
the attention of the shareholders.
Five-year plan
Although we narrowly missed our 
internal target set in 2013 of achieving 
£1bn revenue in 2017, we significantly 
exceeded the underlying operating profit 
target of £30m. The past five years has 
seen significant growth in both revenue 
and underlying operating profit:
• Turnover up £591m, a Compound 
Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 21%
• Underlying operating profit up £28m, 
a CAGR of 29%
It is worth highlighting that the current 
run rate based on revenues in the second 
half of the year is in excess of £1bn.  15 Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Our new plan, the fourth since we became 
a listed Company, is during the next five 
years to grow underlying diluted Earnings 
Per Share to 200p, a 77% increase on 
the 112.6p reported this year. To achieve 
this target, we will continue to achieve 
strong organic growth. In addition, we will 
continue to seek further acquisitions in either 
current or complimentary new sectors. 
Current trading 
Nearly one month into the new financial 
year, we have started well, buoyed by 
additional contracts, largely from existing 
Recruitment customers, all of which are due 
to start by the end of the first quarter. We 
also have a sales pipeline which is larger 
than ever before, and we are focused on 
maintaining our strong track record of 
organic growth by supporting our clients’ 
requirements effectively and efficiently. 
Meanwhile, our PeoplePlus division is 
well placed to benefit as new contract 
opportunities come through this year, 
in Welfare to Work, Justice with OLASS, 
Wellbeing and as a consequence of the 
Apprenticeship Levy. In addition to driving 
organic growth, we continue to look for 
further bolt-on acquisitions, primarily within 
our Recruitment division, and remain in 
discussions with a number of companies. 
On a personal note, this is my 15th and 
final annual Chief Executive’s Statement. 
I am delighted that Staffline has such an 
excellent internal successor to me in Chris 
Pullen. We have worked closely for the 
past two years and share a vision for the 
continued success of the Group and the 
people who work with it, and I wish him and 
his executive team all the best for the future. 
I will continue to support both the business 
and the executive team in any way I can in 
my new role as a Non-Executive Director.
