highlights corporate governance financial statements additional information delivering shareholder value dear fellow shareholder introduction and overview i am delighted that national express has again delivered another year of such strong growth. it is particularly pleasing that these group results have been delivered through growth across all of our internationally diversified business. as a board we are focused on working with and challenging the executive team to realise them. equally, however, when one stands back it is clear that we are in both a period of significant technological change and also an era when the potential application of these myriad innovations is presenting challenge, yes, but also exciting opportunities. our markets are created when state provision of public transport is transferred to the private sector. this is supported by a trend towards market liberalisation, such as european union directives focused on opening up bus and rail networks. our services benefit from increasing urbanisation around the world, in particular driving demand for bus operations. opportunity improved access to city centre locations, such as priority bus lanes for environmentally friendly transport and lower congestion. technology can also be used to provide more efficient planning and real-time scheduling for transport services. our markets are created when

remaining 3% is from other revenue streams such as on board entertainment, sms alerts, booking fees and advertising. in recent years, our increasingly sophisticated use of revenue management systems (rms) has been a notable factor. converting it to profit national express maintains industry-leading margins through a relentless focus on operational excellence in all we do. we prioritise safe operations the group operates consistent, world-class safety policies in all markets, supported by leading edge technology. relevance to strategy demonstrates how efficiently the group is deploying its capital resources and generating operating profit. high safety standards also help to drive sustainable growth through customer loyalty and new business wins. remuneration linkage non-financial

delivering results national express has delivered perhaps its strongest ever set of results in 2017, with good growth across all of our internationally diversified portfolio. i believe that we are seeing the benefit of our focus on operational excellence, technology investment and disciplined acquisition in these results. north america’s combination of customer focus, contract retention and successful acquisitions has driven a record result. alsa has also delivered a very strong performance, propelled by its increasingly sophisticated real time revenue management system (rms). we have moved deliberately away from a business model where our prosperity was significantly determined by the instabilities of uk rail. these three new market entries have all been profitable in their first full year of operations. it is precisely this strong partnership approach that we are looking to further enhance by working closely together to make sure the 2022 commonwealth games in birmingham are a success and deliver significant transport improvements before the games begin. we are working on innovative new transport technologies, with alsa developing autonomous, electric vehicle projects in madrid, for example. i believe new technology presents a real opportunity to drive organic growth, improve standards and realise cost efficiencies. our spanish long haul services which have rms installed also saw revenue increase by 3.9% and seat occupancy rates up over two percent. strategy operational excellence we aim to give our customers safe, punctual and frequent transport services at excellent prices. our uk bus business achieved a record- equalling customer satisfaction score of 87% in the independent transport focus survey (also up 1% year-on-year). one area where we have shown particular leadership is through the installation and use of smart safety cameras on our vehicles. new technology presents a real opportunity to drive organic growth, improve standards and realise cost efficiencies. we have also – uniquely within the industry – installed an online complaints management system in all of our school bus depots. this provides the opportunity for both tailored driver training and fuller evidence to be used in insurance claims. it will be augmented in 2018 with a comprehensive internal communications campaign to reinforce the crucial importance of speed management. we made three acquisitions in north america during 2017, adding over 800 vehicles across the school bus, paratransit, transit and special education sectors. by using our presence – helped by recent acquisitions – in large city markets to operate services across, for example, school bus, transit, paratransit, charter and employee shuttle, we can offer competitive pricing and operational resilience as we benefit from the synergies between the different operations. across the group, our best markets are often those where we successfully combine service excellence, competitive pricing and strong relationships. we believe, therefore, that developing and expanding this approach provides an interesting opportunity for new growth. i am ably supported by a strong, dynamic management team that operates national express’ many businesses with relentless focus and efficiency. i am ably supported by a strong, dynamic management team that operates national express’ many businesses with relentless focus and efficiency. revenue growth has been delivered across the business with performance particularly strong in our overseas businesses. to align external reporting with internal decision making structures, we are presenting the uk as a single operating segment. the 2017 results therefore include an element of catch up from prior years that we were not able to recognise before this year. reconciliation of roce 2017 £m group statutory operating profit 197.9 intangible amortisation for acquired businesses 38.0 uk restructuring costs 5.6 return – normalised group operating

received a five-star accreditation from the european foundation for quality management. alsa is also using technology to drive up standards and has started installing drivecam smart safety cameras, aiming to have over 1,000 (around 45% of the spanish fleet) by the end of 2018. additionally, by the end of march, all their vehicles will have speed monitoring technology installed, supporting a

transportation and transit services. just over a third of the market is outsourced with recent increases in outsource conversion being driven by pressure on public funding. it is consistently delivering growth by embedding a culture of customer service, efficiency and technological investment across the business. we have donated to local community groups and funded a new home being built through habitat for humanity. our focus on service and strong local relationships, with customer satisfaction scores again above 90%, has helped deliver these results. we are already recording a significant reduction in the cost of preventable accidents after drivecam has been installed. this is an increasingly important area of our safety management, with a high profile internal campaign being launched shortly. strategic report corporate governance financial statements additional information national express group plc annual report 2017 27 business review: north america management

prioritisation work due to start shortly. customers in coventry are already using and benefiting from them, with daily capping a key feature. all of our uk fleet is fitted with gps technology allowing detailed speed management and monitoring. they have been profitable from their first full year of operation and we believe will continue to deliver typical rail margins in the future. our rhine münster express services grew passengers by nearly one percent in 2017 despite significant track maintenance disruption. indeed, overall in 2017 we carried over 882 million passengers, up 1.2% on a continuing basis, on 2016. this nimble and granular approach is entirely in line with our vision of earning the lifetime loyalty of our customers by consistently delivering frequent, high performing public transport services which offer excellent value. these reviews have resulted in the introduction of new group-wide standard operating excellence procedures and also generated savings for each business’ 2018 budget. during 2017, we also enhanced these standards with five new global safety policies: – speed management – driving evaluation – competency of driving evaluators – driver monitoring – driver performance management each of these new policies targets critical areas for further improvement in our safety performance. performance and implementation is reviewed in a

opportunities mitigates risk in this area. however, while culture might originate from the behaviour of leaders, it cannot be sustained by top-down mandates and examples alone. this was to take up the operational position as president and ceo of our north america business, based in chicago, on 1 september. i believe there is a natural opportunity in relation to non-executive director rotation over the next few years for us to consider our board diversity, in its widest sense, including gender diversity (where 17% of our directors are female), as one of the factors when making future appointments. 2 matt ashley was group finance director through to 31 may 2017 and took up his new role on 1 september 2017. 3 joaquín ayuso was unable to attend the board and safety & environment

operating companies. prior to joining national express, he was group chief executive of tube lines from may 2009. before that he worked for over ten years in senior roles within firstgroup plc where he was managing director of the rail division from 2000 to 2004 and then was appointed to the main board as group commercial director in 2004, before being made group finance director. jorge is a

report 2017 national express group plc corporate governance report diversity at board level while all appointments are made on merit, the board strongly believes that an increasing diversity at board level is acknowledged as essential in maintaining a competitive advantage. the potential risk is around the recoverability of these balances, particularly in relation to our alsa and north america businesses, as assessed annually by management as part of their goodwill impairment review using discounted cash flows on a value in use basis. our principal suppliers are also required to have similar policies and practices in place within their own businesses. of vital importance is the coaching of every driver who triggers a recorded event (by braking harshly, swerving or through collision) and the committee has noted that this hands-on and immediate response approach is starting to change driver behaviour. the focus on employee engagement continues, with fleet efficiency and improving miles per gallon fuel usage remaining key deliverables in all divisions. our share price increased by 8% ahead of sector competitors and a 10% increase in the final dividend is proposed. the

for the year ended 31 december 2017 1 corporate information the consolidated financial statements of national express group plc and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 december 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 1 march 2018. national express group plc is a public limited company incorporated in england and wales whose shares are publicly traded on the london stock exchange. details of the assumptions made are set out in note 34, to these financial statements along with their sensitivities. their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements. rail revenue in germany comprises passenger revenues and subsidy income receivable from the public transport authorities. north america revenue from school boards and similar contracts is recognised as the services are provided. they are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. except for goodwill impairments, a review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether they no longer exist or may have decreased. future depreciation or amortisation is then adjusted to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount over its remaining useful economic life. notes to the consolidated accounts continued for the year ended 31 december 2017 annual report 2017 national express group plc financial statements 124 125 2 accounting policies continued derivative financial instruments the group uses derivative financial instruments such as fuel derivatives, interest rate derivatives, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge its risks associated with fuel price, interest rate fluctuations and foreign currency. after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. based on initial assessment, our current expe ctation is that there will be a transitional increase in provisions of approximately £20m. under ifrs 9 the group will elect to recognise its available-for-sale investments at fair value through other comprehensive inc ome. for hedge accounting we have assessed ifrs 9 and do not expect a material impact on the group’s financial statements, other than certain disclosure points as referred to below. just over half of group revenue is derived from documented cont racts that cover periods of at least one year, with a significan t remainder being ticket and other sales to travelling customers and sh orter-term contracts such as private hire. the group estimates that only a small proportion rela te to payments for short-term and low-value leases. information reported to the group executive team does not regularly include an analysis of assets and liabilities by segment. 9 net finance costs share options without nil exercise price share options with nil exercise price 2017 2016 2017 2016 risk

taxation (a) analysis of taxation charge in the year the tax credit on separately disclosed items of £20.0m comprises an £11.4m tax credit on intangibles, a £7.5m net credit in relation to the us tax rate reduction (see note 10(c)) and a tax credit of £1.1m for other items. all uk corporation tax returns up to 2015 have been submitted and agreed by hmrc except for one outstanding matter. based on current forecasts, it is estimated that the losses recognised for deferred tax purposes will be utilised within three to four years. it is not believed that any reasonably possible movement in key and other assumptions will lead to an impairment. this includes control over the acquired businesses and increased scale in our north american operations, along with synergy benefits expected to be achieved. (b) acquisitions – alsa during the year the alsa division acquired 100% control of six businesses in spain and switzerland, none of which are material individually: − odier excursions sa – tourist

borrowings continued in 2017, the group entered into additional unsecured committed revolving credit facilities totalling £32.0m. the group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence. in terms of trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no confirmed indications as at the year end reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations (see risk and risk management section for details of how management manages this process). derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are classified as fair value through profit or loss and are carried on the balance sheet at their fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at their fair value. after initial fair value recognition, these instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. post-employment benefits for north america, alsa and uk rail have been combined into the ‘other’ category. the group has some inflation linking in its revenue streams, which helps to offset this risk. uk company date of actuarial valuation 31 march 2016 5 april 2016 rate of investment returns per annum 4.5% 0%-2.1% increase in earnings per annum 2.3% –%

financial statements 185 186 company statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 december 2017 the company’s profit and loss account includes £289.5m (2016: £303.5m) that is available for distribution. cumulative gains on the company’s defined benefit pension scheme, which is currently in a net surplus position, are deemed to be not distributable. in addition, own shares have been purchased out of distributable profits and therefore reduce the reserves available for distribution. tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: the carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. after initial recognition, interest- bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 4 intangible
