express group plc annual report 2017 13 key performance indicators our strategy is delivering results national express has delivered perhaps its strongest ever set of results in 2017, with good growth across all of our internationally diversified portfolio. i believe that we are seeing the benefit of our focus on operational excellence, technology investment and disciplined acquisition in these results. we have moved deliberately away from a business model where our prosperity was significantly determined by the instabilities of uk rail. our spanish long haul services which have rms installed also saw revenue increase by 3.9% and seat occupancy rates up over two percent. our uk bus business achieved a record- equalling customer satisfaction score of 87% in the independent transport focus survey (also up 1% year-on-year). one area where we have shown particular leadership is through the installation and use of smart safety cameras on our vehicles. we made three acquisitions in north america during 2017, adding over 800 vehicles across the school bus, paratransit, transit and special education sectors. i am ably supported by a strong, dynamic management team that operates national express’ many businesses with relentless focus and efficiency. i am ably supported by a strong, dynamic management team that operates national express’ many businesses with relentless focus and efficiency. the 2017 results therefore include an element of catch up from prior years that we were not able to recognise before this year. we continue to deliver strong performances from our acquisitions, delivering returns on invested capital of at least 15% in the first full year after acquisition. – 176 concessions: 125 intercity coach concessions, 35 urban bus

the industry leader, alsa consolidated its reputation with a number of important awards to complement its record customer satisfaction score. just over a third of the market is outsourced with recent increases in outsource conversion being driven by pressure on public funding. they have been profitable from their first full year of operation and we believe will continue to deliver typical rail margins in the future. these reviews have resulted in the introduction of new group-wide standard operating excellence procedures and also generated savings for each business’ 2018 budget. deputy
