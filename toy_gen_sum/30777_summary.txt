manufacturing and technical industries are concentrated. lili currently heads the oil & gas practice and consults to a range of international clients. the group’s revenue growth, combined with continued discipline on costs, helped lift headline operating profit by 24%. it is worth noting, however, that requests for quotation in the subsea sector have picked up considerably. during 2017 we made further progress against our strategy, delivering higher group return on sales of 18.0%. we also continue to look at acquisition and investment opportunities that will grow our business. these are traditionally small bolt-on facilities that can provide us with infills to our existing network. where opportunities to buy such facilities do not exist, we will build new facilities; these obviously have a ramp-up period, but have the advantage of being designed exactly in line with the group’s technology and operational efficiency focus. the group’s revenue growth, combined with continued discipline on costs, helped lift headline operating profit by 24%. our business, by its nature, has limited forward visibility, but we have entered the year with good momentum. the global leader customer focus global network transferable know-how ■ ■ bodycote is focused on continual improvement of our quality of service and takes an active role in finding solutions to technical issues and promoting mutual business development with our customers. this makes bodycote’s processing inherently more efficient than customers’ in-house operations (see page 34) and competitors, thereby enhancing our competitive position in the subcontract market. the scope of bodycote’s network enables us to specialise more effectively than competitors at individual locations and provides comprehensive backup for our customers. ■ ■ bodycote’s quality management systems, validated by major engineering oems, have been developed to meet the requirements of international and national accrediting bodies. bodycote’s objective is to create superior shareholder returns £ through the provision of selected thermal processing services that are highly valued by our customers, giving full

bodycote’s heat treatment processes, in particular low pressure carburising (lpc), enable modern transmissions to deliver high performance and seamless response, even reducing noise during gear changes. the gears are dimensionally measured before heat treatment to monitor and maintain repeatability of distortion. the gears are measured again after heat treatment to check any distortion is within limits. a set of differentiated processes giving customers the ability to produce unique high value-adding products. improving a material’s hardness through heat treatment allows it to resist various types of wear. corr-i-dur ® is an environmentally friendly alternative to the use of hard chromium, electroless nickel and other galvanic coatings. further details are included in the

honeycomb seals for further information about our services go to www.bodycote.com/services efﬁcient and durable 16 bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 december 2016 honeycomb, a structure borrowed from nature, provides an excellent strength to weight ratio when used in manufacturing applications. this double role performed by the honeycomb seal results in better fuel efﬁciency and longer service life of turbine blades. it was also notable that growth in north american civil aviation revenues picked up through the year. headline operating profit 1 was £64.2m, an increase of 11% (15% at actual rates), benefiting from positive operational leverage as revenues grew. bodycote has a long and successful history of servicing this division’s wide-ranging customer base. acquisitions made in 2016 contributed 2.9% of the constant currency growth, with new facilities contributing a further 1 .5%. moreover, since 2014, the group has invested £125m in growth investment projects, many of which are not yet fully mature and are not contributing as fully to group returns as they will once they have all reached financial maturity. the board does not expect this will have a material impact on bodycote as customers are served locally and cross- border trading is minimal and this therefore remains as an element of the existing market risk. ■ ■ there is a continued focus on customer service and quality processes to maintain excellent relationships with major customers. ■ ■ programme in place to focus on reduction of incidents which could have a high impact. in addition a number of sites are exposed to natural hazards, such as earthquakes, flooding and storms. increasing capital projects can be highly complex and rely on factors outside of the group’s control. this may cause projects to be delivered late or at a higher cost than forecast. ■ ■ capital project risk will be subject to internal audit review in 2018. strategic report governance financial statements additional

ensure that their personal interests do not at any time conflict with those of bodycote. bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment, which is operated around the clock so as to optimise treatment processing cycles. without bodycote, many companies would be using older in-house technology and running their equipment at reduced capacity, both of which drain energy resources. the group collects electricity and natural gas usage information from each facility on a monthly basis. operational plants which have not yet received accreditation to the standard are working towards it. the group’s total co 2 e emission data is based on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, as defined by the uk government’s defra, and data relating to this has been calculated to include country- specific electricity conversion factors. as a result all previous years have now been restated using iea conversion factors to ensure that year-on-year comparisons are consistent. bodycote uses established systems to develop best practice at specific sites and across the wider group. the continued replacement of traditional lighting with led for environmental and improved safety has resulted in further co 2 reductions. our sites at sprockhövel, otterfing, esslingen, korntal, wehingen, gothenburg and warsaw will benefit from projected total savings of 192.4te co 2 annually. meanwhile in denmark our ejby

directors and other senior executives are expected, within five years of appointment, to build up a shareholding in the company. any external appointment must not conflict with the directors’ duties and commitments to bodycote plc. base salaries for executive directors are typically reviewed annually (or more frequently if specific circumstances necessitate this) by the committee in december each year. this will also extend to the reimbursement of taxable work-related expenses, such as travel and relocation. from 2018 onwards, 35% of any bonus earned is deferred into shares for three years, conditional on continued employment until vesting date. roce and eps are our top two kpis as shown on page 16 of the annual report. a significant change to the measures used would only be adopted following consultation with major shareholders. details of performance targets will be included in the relevant year’s annual report on remuneration. the company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the company to pay any more than is necessary. in line with the articles of association, accumulative total fees for non- executive directors are capped at £500,000 p.a. any external appointment must not conflict with the directors’ duties and commitments to bodycote plc. note that this section has been revised to include the service contract of d yates. each independent non-executive director’s term of office runs for a maximum three year period. if a contract is to be terminated, the committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. in 2017 we no longer consider the completeness and accuracy of environmental remediation provisions to be a key audit matter. pbt group materiality pbt £117m group materiality £5.6m component materiality range £1.5m to £2.8m audit committee reporting threshold £0.28m we agreed with the audit committee that we would

all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, plus appropriate borrowing costs, less any recognised impairment loss. subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. derivative
