changes and   senior management overview i am pleased to announce that, with  effect from 24 january 2018, chris  pullen is appointed as chief executive  of staffline group plc. chris succeeds  andy hogarth who will step down from  his current role while remaining on the  board as a non-executive director. i am delighted that we have an experienced  management team in place to deliver the  group’s next development plan. i would  also like to thank the whole team for all their  continued efforts, support and contribution. underpinned with strong  compliance and ethical standards staffline is a values-based organisation  which exists to help our customers be more  successful. this has meant that we have  continued to win new business in line with  prior year levels of growth. this demonstrates that  staffline’s geographical and operational  scale means we remain the go-to  supplier across most industry sectors. 24 new delegates joined  the programme in november 2017 with  a further 40 planned for january 2018.  these apprenticeships are aimed at  our first line managers, enhancing  their skills and capability to be the best  they can be, delivering results through  others, learning more about business  improvement techniques and customer  excellence. this high level of performance will put us  in a strong position for the next iteration  of these contracts, which are a strategic  priority for us as we look to grow in the  offender learning and skills market. general data protection regulation  (“gdpr”)  staffline will comply with applicable  gdpr regulations when they take effect in  2018, including as a data processor, while  also working closely with our providers  of finance, customers and partners to  meet contractual obligations for our

response business  interruption –  information  security breach  or cyber-attack there are two issues the group focuses on  with regard to this risk: 1. major it failure – as with all large scale  businesses, including those in the market  sectors in which we operate, we are  reliant on our it systems to support and  operate our business. a gdpr steering committee  has been set up to review the impact of  the new regulation, with a programme  of data security improvements  due to be rolled out in q1 2018.  operational pressure on  margins by  customers recent trends have seen recruitment  revenues increase but with lower increases  in gross profit. recruitment uses a pricing model to  ensure no offer is quoted or accepted  which would put unacceptable pressure  on margins. new business wins improve efficiency  (overheads spread over larger base)  and reduce the impact of one customer  demanding lower margins. this will continue to focus on  our energy consumption, waste, travel  and use of sustainable materials. as finance director, he led  the mbo and subsequent trade sale in  2002 of pipeline constructors group,  a £100m utility services business. he has previously held the

material misstatement or loss. within the payroll team we  maintain appropriate levels of ongoing  training to ensure compliance with  relevant legislation and procedures. in special circumstances, such  as when they are large scale, acquisitions  continue to be run on separate systems. however, we  have reported on certain of our corporate  governance arrangements by drawing upon  best practice available. in deciding appropriate levels, the  committee takes into account objective research on comparable  companies, general market conditions and performance. john crabtree, ed barker and tracy lewis each have  contracts terminable on six months’ notice given by either  party. the  directors have proposed a final dividend of £4,025,000 (15.7 pence  per share) (2016: £3,906,000, 15.3 pence per share) to be paid on  3 july 2018, to shareholders registered on 1 june 2018. this has not  been included within creditors as it was not formally approved  before the financial year end. underperformance within these acquired businesses could  impact the impairment reviews performed on a cash generating  unit level. within the peopleplus segment there are a number of significant  contracts which include key performance measures, bonus and/ or penalty clauses. these include rebate clauses which result in  retrospective changes being made to agreed prices, depending  on key metrics over the contract life. in setting our audit scope, we included any individual subsidiary which contributed more than 15% to revenues or the underlying profit  before taxation. an impairment review is undertaken when events or circumstances indicate the carrying  amount may not be recoverable. individual intangible assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least  annually. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss  previously recognised may no longer exist. the schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance  companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. in addition, long-term provisions are discounted to their present values, where time value of money is material. all provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. no adjustment is made to the expense recognised in prior periods if fewer share options  ultimately are exercised than originally estimated. it is also assumed that members commute 75% of  the maximum hmrc allowance based on current commutation factors. in 2016, the group  secured a further £7.5m of working capital facility, available to be drawn down with two days’ notice. no sub-lease income is due as all assets  held under lease agreements are used exclusively by the group. the group’s trade and other receivables are actively monitored to avoid significant concentrations of credit risk. the group has adopted a policy of carefully monitoring all customers, especially those who lack an appropriate credit history. deal fees (16.8) (37 .2) (63.7) (17 .8) 4.9 goodwill, intangibles 115.0 117 .4
