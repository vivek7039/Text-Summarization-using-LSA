and a strong balance sheet. further details on the group’s dividend policy can be found within the chief financial officer’s report on page 23. board changes and senior management overview i am pleased to announce that, with effect from 24 january 2018, chris pullen is appointed as chief executive of staffline group plc. chris succeeds andy hogarth who will step down from his current role while remaining on the board as a non-executive director. he is ideally positioned to lead the business through its next stage of strategic development. i am delighted that we have an experienced management team in place to deliver the group’s next development plan. i would also like to thank the whole team for all their continued efforts, support and contribution. underpinned with strong compliance and ethical standards staffline is a values-based organisation which exists to help our customers be more successful. during the year, we invested heavily within recruitment, specifically on it infrastructure and new senior talent, which saw overheads rise by 7.9%, the net result of which is that underlying operating profit, before finance charges, increased by 7.4%, to £20.2m (2016: £18.8m). this has meant that we have continued to win new business in line with prior year levels of growth. this demonstrates that staffline’s geographical and operational scale means we remain the go-to supplier across most industry sectors. in addition, uk unemployment rates at 42-year lows have impacted on our ability to attract candidates. 24 new delegates joined the programme in november 2017 with a further 40 planned for january 2018. these apprenticeships are aimed at our first line managers, enhancing their skills and capability to be the best they can be, delivering results through others, learning more about business improvement techniques and customer excellence. this high level of performance will put us in a strong position for the next iteration of these contracts, which are a strategic priority for us as we look to grow in the offender learning and skills market. there is a strong pipeline of new opportunities for further growth in the apprentice market. general data protection regulation (“gdpr”) staffline will comply with applicable gdpr regulations when they take effect in 2018, including as a data processor, while also working closely with our providers of finance, customers and partners to meet contractual obligations for our procedures, products and services. i am delighted that staffline has such an excellent internal successor to me in chris pullen. andy hogarth chief executive officer 23 january 2018 last five years underlying operating profit cagr 29% next five years targeted underlying diluted eps growth 77% 16 staffline group plc annual report 2017 recruitment “ we are a leading workforce recruitment and management organisation, specialising in labour solutions in agriculture, food processing, manufacturing, e-retail, driving and the logistics sectors.” our vision is to enable the future of work by helping society as people increasingly want to work with more flexibility, when they want and where they want and helping our customers to be more efficient by providing flexible workforces, when they want and where they want 17 overview strategic report corporate governance financial statements • continued expansion of the onsite model, increased by 38 sites during the year. we acknowledge that the adjustments made to arrive at underlying profit may not be comparable to those made by other companies, mainly in respect of the adjustment for share based payment charges, including both equity and cash settled components. free cashflows, being underlying ebitda plus working capital movement, less tax paid and capex, amount to £37.9m in 2017 (2016: £36.0m). our recruitment division revenue accounting policy, detailed within the accounting policies section of this annual report, is unaffected by the application of this new standard as we currently recognise revenue once a performance obligation has been delivered. the board recognises that effective risk management is a critical part of achieving our strategic objectives. work programme revenue as a % of peopleplus revenues 49% (2016: 52%) 26 staffline group plc annual report 2017 operational risk our response business interruption – information security breach or cyber-attack there are two issues the group focuses on with regard to this risk: 1. major it failure – as with all large scale businesses, including those in the market sectors in which we operate, we are reliant on our it systems to support and operate our business. a gdpr steering committee has been set up to review the impact of the new regulation, with a programme of data security improvements due to be rolled out in q1 2018. operational pressure on margins by customers recent trends have seen recruitment revenues increase but with lower increases in gross profit. recruitment uses a pricing model to ensure no offer is quoted or accepted which would put unacceptable pressure on margins. new business wins improve efficiency (overheads spread over larger base) and reduce the impact of one customer demanding lower margins. new starter id checks 150,400 (2016: 144,100) 28 staffline group plc annual report 2017 corporate social responsibility building a sustainable future at staffline, we place great importance on the role we play in helping support local communities and the environment surrounding us. this will continue to focus on our energy consumption, waste, travel and use of sustainable materials. as finance director, he led the mbo and subsequent trade sale in 2002 of pipeline constructors group, a £100m utility services business. he has previously held the role of ceo of apcoa parking (uk) ltd, which provides parking services across the uk, where he led a turnaround and subsequent significant growth, as well as senior management positions at itc legal services ltd and national car parks limited. as finance director, he led the mbo and subsequent trade sale in 2002 of pipeline constructors group, a £100m

as well as senior management positions at itc legal services ltd and national car parks limited. the system of internal financial control is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. within the payroll team we maintain appropriate levels of ongoing training to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and procedures. in special circumstances, such as when they are large scale, acquisitions continue to be run on separate systems. however, we have reported on certain of our corporate governance arrangements by drawing upon best practice available. in deciding appropriate levels, the committee takes into account objective research on comparable companies, general market conditions and performance. the non-executive directors do not receive any benefits apart from their basic salaries or fees. john crabtree, ed barker and tracy lewis each have contracts terminable on six months’ notice given by either party. the directors have proposed a final dividend of £4,025,000 (15.7 pence per share) (2016: £3,906,000, 15.3 pence per share) to be paid on 3 july 2018, to shareholders registered on 1 june 2018. this has not been included within creditors as it was not formally approved before the financial year end. underperformance within these acquired businesses could impact the impairment reviews performed on a cash generating unit level. within the peopleplus segment there are a number of significant contracts which include key performance measures, bonus and/ or penalty clauses. in recognising revenue under these contracts, a number of significant estimates are required to be made by management, most notably the level of expected bonuses/penalty charges which will be settled post-year end, relating to pre-year end activities. these include rebate clauses which result in retrospective changes being made to agreed prices, depending on key metrics over the contract life. in setting our audit scope, we included any individual subsidiary which contributed more than 15% to revenues or the underlying profit before taxation. 46 staffline group plc annual report 2017 consolidated statement of changes

goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing. individual intangible assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually. with the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. this applies also to temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. the schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. in addition, long-term provisions are discounted to their present values, where time value of money is material. all provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. share-based employee remuneration all share based payment arrangements are recognised in the consolidated financial statements. no adjustment is made to the expense
